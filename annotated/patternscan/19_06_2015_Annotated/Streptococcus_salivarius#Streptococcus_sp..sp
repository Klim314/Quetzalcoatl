TI  == streptococcus salivarius k12 limits group b streptococcus vaginal colonization.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus, gbs) colonizes the rectovaginal  tract in 20-30% of women and during pregnancy can be transmitted to the newborn,  causing severe invasive disease. current routine screening and antibiotic prophylaxis have fallen short of complete prevention of gbs transmission and gbs  remains a leading cause of neonatal infection. we have investigated the ability of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant member of the native human oral microbiota, to control gbs colonization. comparison of the antibacterial activity of multiple s. salivarius strains using a deferred antagonism test showed that s. salivarius k12 (k12) exhibited the broadest spectrum of activity against gbs. k12 effectively inhibited all gbs strains tested, including disease-implicated isolates from newborns, and colonizing isolates from the vaginal tract of pregnant women. inhibition was dependent on the presence of megaplasmid pssal-k12, which encodes the bacteriocins salivaricin a and salivaricin b; however, in co-culture experiments, gbs growth was impeded by k12 independent of  the megaplasmid. we also demonstrated that k12 adheres to and invades human vaginal epithelial cells at levels comparable to gbs. inhibitory activity of k12  was examined in vivo using a mouse model of gbs vaginal colonization. mice colonized with gbs were treated vaginally with k12. k12 administration significantly reduced gbs vaginal colonization compared to non-treated controls,  and this effect was partially dependent on the k12 megaplasmid. our results suggest that k12 may have potential as a preventative therapy to control gbs vaginal colonization and thereby prevent its transmission to the neonate during pregnancy.

TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota profile in breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants using pyrosequencing.
AB  == background/objectives: feeding in infancy is the most significant determinant of  the intestinal microbiota in early life. the aim of this study was to determine the gut microbiota of korean infants and compare the microbiota obtained between  breast-fed and formula-fed korean infants. subjects/methods: we analyzed the microbial communities in fecal samples collected from twenty 4-week old korean (ten samples in each breast-fed or formula-fed) infants using pyrosequencing. results: the fecal microbiota of the 4-week-old korean infants consisted of the three phyla actinobacteria, firmicutes, and proteobacteria. in addition, five species, including bifidocbacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius, strepotococcus lactarius, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and lactobacillus gasseri were common commensal intestinal microbiota in all infants. the predominant intestinal microbiota in the breast-fed infants (bfi) included the phylum actinobacteria (average 70.55%), family bifidobacteriacea (70.12%), genus  bifidobacterium (70.03%) and species bifidobacterium longum (69.96%). in the microbiota from the formula-fed infants (ffi), the proportion of the phylum actinobacteria (40.68%) was less, whereas the proportions of firmicutes (45.38%)  and proteobacteria (13.85%) as well as the diversity of each taxonomic level were greater, compared to those of the bfi. the probiotic species found in the 4-week-old korean infants were bifidobacterium longum, streptococcus salivarius,  and lactobacillus gasseri. these probiotic species accounted for 93.81% of the microbiota from the bfi, while only 63.80% of the microbiota from the ffi. in particular, b. longum was more abundant in bfi (69.96%) than in ffi (34.17%). conclusions: breast milk supports the growth of b. longum and inhibits others. to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy korean infants according to the feeding type using pyrosequencing. our data can be used as a basis for further studies to investigate the development of intestinal microbiota with aging and disease status.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems and salivary secretion rates - a 3-year follow-up after radiation therapy to the head and neck region.
AB  == objective: results indicate that late improvements of radiation therapy (rt) in the head and neck region may diminish the long-term effects on salivary glands and oral microflora. the aim was therefore to analyze salivary secretion rates and oral microflora over time in rt subjects. design: twelve dentate subjects (28+/-2 teeth) and 12 controls were included. a clinical examination was performed and the salivary secretion rates were determined. microbial samples, analyzed using cultivation technique, were collected from the soft tissues, supragingival plaque and gingival crevice region. results: compared with the controls, the rt group (n=11) had 3 years post rt higher numbers and proportions  of lactobacilli (p<0.001 and p<0.01) and candida albicans (p<0.01 and p<0.05) in  the supragingival plaque, higher numbers of enterococci in the vestibulum in the  molar region and on the tongue (p<0.05 for both), a lower total count (p<0.001) and lower numbers of streptococci, streptococcus salivarius and fusobacterium nucleatum (p<0.01) on the tongue. although both stimulated and unstimulated salivary secretion rates were increased over time, the proportion of microorganisms associated with oral health decreased, and microorganisms associated with oral disorders increased. despite a comparable oral hygiene, it was only the 27% who had a stimulated salivary secretion rate >/=1.0ml/min and a  buffering capacity >/=6.0, where a recovery of the flora could be seen. conclusion: the results indicate that regaining a normal, stimulated salivary secretion rate and buffering capacity are prerequisites to regaining an oral flora associated with good oral health.

TI  == mechanistic analysis of plga/hpmc-based in-situ forming implants for periodontitis treatment.
AB  == in-situ forming implant formulations based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga), acetyltributyl citrate (atbc), minocycline hcl, n-methyl pyrrolidone (nmp) and optionally hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hpmc) were prepared and thoroughly characterized in vitro. this includes electron paramagnetic resonance  (epr), nuclear magnetic resonance (1h nmr), mass change and drug release measurements under different conditions, optical microscopy, size exclusion chromatography (sec) as well as antibacterial activity tests using gingival crevicular fluid samples from periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients. based on these results, deeper insight into the physico-chemical phenomena involved in implant formation and the control of drug release could be gained. for instance, the effects of adding hpmc to the formulations, resulting in improved implant adherence and reduced swelling, could be explained. importantly, the in-situ formed implants effectively hindered the growth of bacteria present in the patients' periodontal pockets. interestingly, the systems were more effectively hindering the growth of pathogenic bacterial strains (e.g., fusobacterium nucleatum) than that of strains with a lower pathogenic potential (e.g., streptococcus salivarius). in vivo, such a preferential action against the pathogenic bacteria can be expected to give a chance to the healthy flora to re-colonize the periodontal pockets.

TI  == novel antimicrobial peptide specifically active against porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, the major etiologic agent of chronic periodontitis, produces a broad spectrum of virulence factors, including outer membrane vesicles, lipopolysaccharides, hemolysins and proteinases. antimicrobial peptides (amps) including bacteriocins have been found to inhibit the growth of p. gingivalis; however, these peptides are relatively large molecules. hence, it is  difficult to synthesize them by a scale-up production. therefore, this study aimed to synthesize a shorter amp that was still active against p. gingivalis. a  peptide that contained three cationic amino acids (arg, his and lys), two anionic amino acids (glu and asp), hydrophobic amino acids residues (leu, ile, val, ala and pro) and hydrophilic residues (ser and gly) was obtained and named pep-7. its bioactivity and stability were tested after various treatments. the mechanism of  action of pep-7 and its toxicity to human red blood cells were investigated. the  pep-7 inhibited two pathogenic p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and p. gingivalis atcc 53978 (wp50) strains at a minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of 1.7 microm, but was ineffective against other oral microorganisms (p. intermedia, tannerella  forsythensis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguinis). from transmission electron microscopy studies, pep-7 caused pore formation at the poles of the cytoplasmic membranes of p. gingivalis. a concentration of pep-7 at  four times that of its mbc induced some hemolysis but only at 0.3 %. the pep-7 was heat stable under pressure (autoclave at 110 and 121 degrees c) and possessed activity over a ph range of 6.8-8.5. it was not toxic to periodontal cells over a range of 70.8-4.4 mum and did not induce toxic pro-inflammatory cytokines. the pep-7 showed selective activity against porphyromonas sp. by altering the permeability barriers of p. gingivalis. the pep-7 was not mutagenic in vitro. this work highlighted the potential for the use of this synthetic pep-7 against p. gingivalis.

TI  == the oral mucosal and salivary microbial community of behcet's syndrome and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == background: behcet's syndrome (bs) is a multisystem immune-related disease of unknown etiology. recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) is characterized by the presence of idiopathic oral ulceration without extraoral manifestation. the interplay between the oral microbial communities and the immune response could play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of both bs and ras. objective: to investigate the salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities in  bs and ras. methods: purified microbial dna isolated from saliva samples (54 bs,  25 healthy controls [hc], and 8 ras) were examined by the human oral microbe identification microarray. cultivable salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities from ulcer and non-ulcer sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis. mycobacterium spp. were detected in saliva and in ulcer and non-ulcer oral mucosal brush biopsies following culture on lowenstein-jensen slopes and mycobacterial growth indicator  tubes. results: there was increased colonization with rothia denticariosa of the  non-ulcer sites of bs and ras patients (p<0.05). ulcer sites in bs were highly colonized with streptococcus salivarius compared to those of ras (p<0.05), and with streptococcus sanguinis compared to hc (p<0.0001). oral mucosa of hc were more highly colonized with neisseria and veillonella compared to all studied groups (p<0.0001). conclusions: despite the uncertainty whether the reported differences in the oral mucosal microbial community of bs and ras are of causative or reactive nature, it is envisaged that restoring the balance of the oral microbial community of the ulcer sites may be used in the future as a new treatment modality for oral ulceration.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of acacia nilotica, murraya koenigii l. sprengel, eucalyptus hybrid, and psidium guajava on primary plaque colonizers: an in vitro  comparison between hot and cold extraction process.
AB  == background: the potential drawbacks of the existing antiplaque agents call for innovative strategies that are safe, effective, and easily available. objective:  the objective was to assess and compare antimicrobial efficacy of four plant extracts derived using hot and cold extraction methods against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus salivarius. materials and methods: the leaves of acacia nilotica, p. guajava, eucalyptus hybrid, and murraya konigii l. sprengel were collected from the surrounding areas, identified and authenticated by a taxonomist. the leaves were washed, shade-dried, and hand  crushed to obtain coarse powder. this was subsequently ground into a fine powder  and extracted using ethanol by cold infusion and hot extraction process. the antimicrobial efficacy testing was done on american type culture collection strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius using agar well diffusion method. 0.2% chlorhexidine and dimethyl sulfoxide were used as positive and negative controls. the mean inhibition zone using 10% concentration of these extracts was compared using independent sample t-test and one-way analysis of variance. results: all the four plant extracts inhibited the growth of s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius irrespective of the method of extraction. the extracts of a. nilotica, p. guajava, and e. hybrid derived from both the methods  of extraction exhibited a significantly higher inhibition zone against s. mutans  in comparison with murraya koenigii l. sprengel and chlorhexidine. the cold extracts of a. nilotica and e. hybrid exhibited higher zone of inhibition against s. sanguis while the hot extracts of m. koenigii l. sprengel exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against s. mutans. conclusion: all the four plant extracts derived using either hot or cold extraction were effective against these bacteria and have the potential to be used as antiplaque agents.

TI  == microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
AB  == awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. in this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. monocultures of klebsiella oxytoca and lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas streptococcus mitis and s. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. yet, neither s. oralis or s. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from k. oxytoca on wound healing. other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. further mechanistic experiments with k. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. these results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.

TI  == commensal streptococcus salivarius modulates ppargamma transcriptional activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == the impact of commensal bacteria in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation has increasingly been demonstrated over the last decades. a multitude of studies have shown direct effects of commensal bacteria from local transcriptional activity to systemic impact. the commensal bacterium streptococcus salivarius is one of the early bacteria colonizing the oral and gut mucosal surfaces. it has been shown to down-regulate nuclear transcription factor (nf-small ka, cyrillicb) in human intestinal cells, a central regulator of the host mucosal immune system response  to the microbiota. in order to evaluate its impact on a further important transcription factor shown to link metabolism and inflammation in the intestine,  namely ppargamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor), we used human intestinal epithelial cell-lines engineered to monitor ppargamma transcriptional  activity in response to a wide range of s. salivarius strains. we demonstrated that different strains from this bacterial group share the property to inhibit ppargamma activation independently of the ligand used. first attempts to identify the nature of the active compounds showed that it is a low-molecular-weight, dnase-, proteases- and heat-resistant metabolite secreted by s. salivarius strains. among ppargamma-targeted metabolic genes, i-fabp and angptl4 expression  levels were dramatically reduced in intestinal epithelial cells exposed to s. salivarius supernatant. both gene products modulate lipid accumulation in cells and down-regulating their expression might consequently affect host health. our study shows that species belonging to the salivarius group of streptococci impact both host inflammatory and metabolic regulation suggesting a possible role in the host homeostasis and health.

TI  == colostrum of healthy slovenian mothers: microbiota composition and bacteriocin gene prevalence.
AB  == microbial communities inhabiting the breast milk microenvironment are essential in supporting mammary gland health in lactating women and in providing gut-colonizing bacterial 'inoculum' for their infants' gastro-intestinal development. bacterial dna was extracted from colostrum samples of 45 healthy slovenian mothers. characteristics of the communities in the samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis (dgge) and by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). pcr screening for the prevalence of bacteriocin genes was performed on dna of culturable and total colostrum bacteria. dgge profiling revealed the presence of staphylococcus  and gemella in most of the samples and exposed 4 clusters based on the abundance  of 3 bands: staphylococcus epidermidis/gemella, streptococcus oralis/pneumonia and streptococcus salivarius. bacilli represented the largest proportion of the communities. high prevalence in samples at relatively low quantities was confirmed by qpcr for enterobacteria (100%), clostridia (95.6%), bacteroides-prevotella group (62.2%) and bifidobacteria (53.3%). bacterial quantities (genome equivalents ml-1) varied greatly among the samples; staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococci varied in the range of 4 logs, streptococci and all bacteria varied in the range of 2 logs, and other researched groups varied in the range of 1 log. the quantity of most bacterial groups was correlated with the amount of all bacteria. the majority of the genus staphylococcus was represented by the species staphylococcus epidermidis (on average 61%), and their abundances were linearly correlated. determinants of salivaricin a, salivaricin b, streptin and cytolysin were found in single samples. this work provides knowledge on the colostrum microbial community composition of healthy lactating slovenian mothers and reports bacteriocin gene prevalence.

TI  == oral lactic acid bacteria related to the occurrence and/or progression of dental  caries in japanese preschool children.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab), especially those classified into the genus lactobacillus, is associated with the progression of dental caries in preschool children. nevertheless, the kinds of species of lab and the characteristics that are important for dental caries have been unclear. the aims of this study were: (1) to investigate the distribution of oral lab among japanese preschool children with various prevalence levels of caries; and (2) to reveal the characteristics of these isolated lab species. seventy-four japanese preschool children were examined for  caries scores and caries progression, and their dental cavity samples were collected for lab isolation and identification. the saliva-induced agglutination  rate and the resistance to acidic environments of the identified strains were measured. statistical analysis showed that preschool children carrying lactobacillus (l.) salivarius or streptococcus mutans have a significantly higher prevalence of dental caries, the growth ability in acidic environments correlates with the caries scores of individuals with l. salivarius, and the caries scores exhibit positive correlation with saliva-induced agglutination in l. salivarius.  these results show that specific lactobacillus species are associated with dental caries based on the level of carious lesion severity. the present study suggests  that these specific lactobacillus species, especially those with easily agglutinated properties and acid resistance, affect the dental caries scores of preschool children, and that these properties may provide useful information for  research into the prevention of dental caries.

TI  == resistance genes and genetic elements associated with antibiotic resistance in clinical and commensal isolates of streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the diversity of clinical (n = 92) and oral and digestive commensal (n = 120) isolates of streptococcus salivarius was analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (mlst). no clustering of clinical or commensal strains can be observed in the phylogenetic tree. selected strains (92 clinical and 46 commensal strains) were then examined for their susceptibilities to tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, aminoglycosides, and phenicol antibiotics. the presence of resistance genes tet(m), tet(o), erm(a), erm(b), mef(a/e), and catq and associated genetic elements was investigated by pcr, as was the genetic linkage of resistance genes. high rates of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance were  observed among the strains. clinical strains displayed either the erm(b) (macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b [mlsb] phenotype) or mef(a/e) (m phenotype) resistance determinant, whereas almost all the commensal strains harbored the mef(a/e) resistance gene, carried by a macrolide efflux genetic assembly (mega) element. a genetic linkage between a macrolide resistance gene and genes of tn916 was detected in 23 clinical strains and 5 commensal strains, with a predominance of tn3872 elements (n = 13), followed by tn6002 (n = 11) and  tn2009 (n = 4) elements. four strains harboring a mef(a/e) gene were also resistant to chloramphenicol and carried a catq gene. sequencing of the genome of one of these strains revealed that these genes colocalized on an iq-like element, as already described for other viridans group streptococci. icest3-related elements were also detected in half of the isolates. this work highlights the potential role of s. salivarius in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes both in the oral sphere and in the gut.

TI  == effect of rhus coriaria l. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire.
AB  == background and objectives: recently, use of herbal medicine and plant extracts as a substitute for commercially available chemical drugs for control of infectious  diseases such as dental caries and periodontal disease has become increasingly popular. the present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of rhus coriaria l. water extract on five common oral bacteria and bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. materials and methods: for primary assessment of the antibacterial properties of rhus coriaria l. water extract, the well-plate method in bhia (brain heart infusion agar, merck, germany) medium was used using macrodilution method, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the extract against each microorganism were determined. the effect of rhus coriaria l. on bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire was assessed using viable cell count in biofilm medium (bm) containing 3% sucrose. in the final phase, after fixation of samples in alcohol and glutaraldehyde, samples were prepared for sem (scanning electron microscopy)  analysis. results: the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition was proportionate to the tested concentrations of the extract. the lowest mic (0.390  mg/ml) and mbc (1.5 mg/ml ) of the rhus coriaria l. were found to be against streptococcus sobrinus atcc 27607. rhus coriaria l. water extract decreased bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire at mic and 1/8 of mic by s. sanguinis atcc 10556, s. sobrinus atcc 27607, s. salivarius atcc 9222, s. mutans  atcc 35608 and e. faecalis cip 55142 by24.2%-43%, 68.5%-91.6%, 10.6%-79.1%, 22.2%-86.1% and 40.6%-76.4%, respectively. conclusion: based on the results, rhus coriaria l. water extract had significant antibacterial properties against five common oral bacteria and was able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on orthodontic wire. further investigations are recommended for widespread clinical  use of this extract.

TI  == antifouling coatings for dental implants: polyethylene glycol-like coatings on titanium by plasma polymerization.
AB  == titanium dental implants are commonly used for the replacement of lost teeth, but they present a considerable number of failures due to the infection on surrounding tissues. the aim of this paper is the development of a polyethylene glycol-like (peg-like) coating on the titanium surface by plasma polymerization to obtain a novel improved surface with suitable low bacterial adhesion and adequate cell response. surface analysis data of these coatings are presented, in particular, water contact angle, surface roughness, and film chemistry, demonstrating the presence of a peg-like coating. streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius bacterial adhesion assays showed a decreased adhesion on the plasma polymerized samples, while cell adhesion of fibroblasts and osteoblasts on the treated surfaces was similar to control surfaces. thus, the peg-like antifouling coating obtained by plasma polymerization on ti confers this biomaterial's highly suitable properties for dental applications, as they reduce  the possibility of infection while allowing the tissue integration around the implant.

AB  == background: viridans group streptococci (vgs) are both commensal microbes and potential pathogens. increasing resistance to penicillin in vgs is an ongoing issue in the clinical environment. we investigated the difference in susceptibility and resistance to penicillin among various vgs species. methods: in total 1,448 vgs isolated from various clinical specimens were analyzed over a  two-yr period. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux, france) or the microscan microstrep  system (siemens, germany). results: among the 1,448 isolates, 412 were isolated from blood (28.4%). streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently isolated (589 isolates, 40.7%), followed by the s. anginosus group (290 isolates, 20.0%),  s. sanguinis group (179 isolates, 12.4%) and s. salivarius group (57 isolates, 3.9%). in total, 314 isolates could not be identified up to the species level. the overall non-susceptibility to penicillin was observed to be 40.0% (resistant, 11.2% and intermediately resistant, 28.8%) with uneven distribution among groups; 40.2% in s. sanguinis group (resistant, 5.0% and intermediately resistant, 35.2%), 60.3% in s. mitis group (resistant, 20.9% and intermediately resistant, 39.4%), 78.9% in s. salivarius group (resistant, 8.8% and intermediately resistant, 70.1%), and 6.2% in s. anginosus group (resistant, 1.7% and intermediately resistant, 4.5%). conclusions: antimicrobial resistance patterns towards penicillin show differences among various vgs; this should be considered  while devising an effective antimicrobial treatment against vgs.

TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == probiotics in addition to antibiotics for the treatment of acute tonsillitis: a randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts,  confer a health benefit on the host. the probiotic streptococcus salivarius has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency of recurrent pharyngeal infections in children and adult populations. however, probiotics have not yet been evaluated in the treatment of acute pharyngotonsillitis in adults. we aimed  to examine whether the addition of s. salivarius probiotics to the routine therapy of acute pharyngotonsillitis in adult patients may shorten disease duration and reduce symptom severity. this study was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study comparing treatment with probiotics to placebo in addition to antibiotics in patients who were hospitalized with severe  pharyngotonsillitis. laboratory results, pain levels, body temperature, and daily volume of fluids consumed were recorded for both groups. sixty participants were  recruited, 30 for each group. no statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed regarding any of the major clinical and laboratory parameters examined. supplement probiotic treatment with s. salivarius in patients with acute pharyngotonsillitis treated with penicillin is ineffective in relation to the parameters examined in this study and we cannot, therefore, recommend the use of s. salivarius during active pharyngotonsillar infection treated with penicillin.

TI  == recolonization of mutans streptococci after application of chlorhexidine gel.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is specifically suppressed by intensive treatment with chlorhexidine gel, but the time for recolonization and the effect on other oral bacteria are not totally clear. in this study, recolonization of mutans streptococci was evaluated in nine healthy adult volunteers, who were highly colonized with this microorganism. stimulated saliva was collected before (baseline) and at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after application of 1% chlorhexidine  gel on volunteers' teeth for two consecutive days. on each day, the gel was applied using disposable trays for 3 x 5 min with intervals of 5 min between each application. saliva was plated on blood agar to determine total microorganisms (tm); on mitis salivarius agar to determine total streptococci (ts) and on mitis  salivarius agar plus bacitracin to determine mutans streptococci (ms). chlorhexidine was capable of reducing the counts of ms and the proportion of ms with regard to total microorganisms (%ms/tm) (p<0.05), but these values did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after 14 days for ms and 21 days for  %ms/tm. the counts of tm and ts and the proportion of ms to total streptococci did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after chlorhexidine treatment. the results suggest that the effect of chlorhexidine gel treatment on  suppression of mutans streptococci is limited to less than a month in highly colonized individuals.

TI  == antibacterial properties of hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces: a comparison  study between silanization and surface initiated polymerization.
AB  == dental implant failure can be associated with infections that develop into peri-implantitis. in order to reduce biofilm formation, several strategies focusing on the use of antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been studied. to covalently immobilize these molecules onto metallic substrates, several techniques have been developed, including silanization and polymer brush prepared by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp), with varied peptide binding yield and antibacterial performance. the aim of the present study was to compare the efficiency of these methods to immobilize the lactoferrin-derived hlf1-11 antibacterial peptide onto titanium, and evaluate their antibacterial activity in vitro. smooth titanium samples were coated with hlf1-11 peptide under three different conditions: silanization with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (aptes), and polymer brush based coatings with two different silanes. peptide presence was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the mechanical stability of the coatings was studied under ultrasonication. the ldh assays confirmed that hffs viability and proliferation were no affected by the treatments. the in vitro antibacterial properties of the  modified surfaces were tested with two oral strains (streptococcus sanguinis and  lactobacillus salivarius) showing an outstanding reduction. a higher decrease in  bacterial attachment was noticed when samples were modified by atrp methods compared to silanization. this effect is likely due to the capacity to immobilize more peptide on the surfaces using polymer brushes and the nonfouling nature of polymer pdma segment.

TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == identification of non-streptococcal organisms from human dental plaque grown on the streptococcus-selective medium mitis-salivarius agar.
AB  == objective: mitis-salivarius (ms) agar has been used widely in microbial epidemiological studies because oral viridans streptococci can be selectively grown on this medium. even though the previous findings reported the limited selecting power of ms agar for streptococcus strains, the identities of non-streptococcal strains from human oral samples which can grow on this medium are not clear yet. in this study, we identified non-streptococcal organisms grown on ms agar plates by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. design: eighty bacterial colonies on ms plates were isolated from plaque samples, and bacterial identification was achieved with the rapid id 32 strep system and mini api reader. the bacterial colonies identified as non-streptococci by the api system were selected for further identification. the 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr and verified using dna sequencing analysis for identification. sequences were compared with those of reference organisms in the genome database of the national center for biotechnology information using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). results: among the 11 isolated non-streptococcal strains on ms plates, 3 strains  were identified as actinomyces naeslundii, 7 strains were identified as actinomyces oris and 1 strain were identified as actinomyces sp. using blastn. conclusions: in this study, we showed that some oral actinomyces species can grow on streptococcus-selective ms agar plates.

TI  == the probiotic vsl#3 has anti-inflammatory effects and could reduce endoscopic recurrence after surgery for crohn's disease.
AB  == background & aims: probiotic formulations of single species of bacteria have not  been effective in preventing the recurrence of crohn's disease after surgery. we  investigated the ability of vsl#3, a mixture of 8 different bacterial probiotic species, to prevent crohn's disease recurrence after surgery in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. methods: within 30 days of ileocolonic resection and re-anastomosis, patients with crohn's disease were randomly assigned to groups given 1 sachet of vsl#3 (900 billion viable bacteria, comprising 4 strains of lactobacillus, 3 strains of bifidobacterium, and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius subspecies thermophilus) (n = 59) or matching placebo (n = 60). colonoscopy was performed at days 90 and 365 to evaluate the neoterminal ileum for disease recurrence and obtain mucosal biopsies for cytokine analysis. patients from both groups with either no or mild endoscopic recurrence  at day 90 received vsl#3 until day 365. the primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at day 90. results: at day 90, the proportion of patients with severe endoscopic lesions did not differ significantly between vsl#3 (9.3%) and placebo (15.7%, p = .19). the proportions  of patients with non-severe lesions at day 90 who had severe endoscopic recurrence at day 365 were 10.0% in the early vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 for the entire 365 days) and 26.7% in the late vsl#3 group (given vsl#3 from days 90 through 365) (p = .09). aggregate rates of severe recurrence (on days 90 and 365) were not statistically different, 20.5% of subjects in the early vsl#3 group and  42.1% in the late vsl#3 group. patients receiving vsl#3 had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokine levels compared with placebo at day 90 (p < .05). crohn's disease activity index and inflammatory bowel disease quality of life scores were similar in the 2 groups. conclusions: there were no statistical differences in endoscopic recurrence rates at day 90 between patients who received vsl#3 and patients who received placebo. lower mucosal levels of inflammatory cytokines and a lower rate of recurrence among patients who received early vsl#3 (for the entire 365 days) indicate that this probiotic should be further investigated for  prevention of crohn's disease recurrence. clinical trials.gov number: nct00175292.

TI  == regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: in periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (am) and nitric oxide (no). the aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. material and methods: regulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, veillonella atypica, streptococcus salivarius and candida  albicans was examined. am and no were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (no metabolites) griess assay respectively. cellular production of am and inducible no synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. the inter-relationship of am and no production were further investigated with macrophages. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus induced maximal levels of both am and no after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral  keratinocytes. am production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible no synthase inhibitor, nomega -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. likewise, no production was increased upon exposure to am, while the am receptor antagonist am 22-52 reduced the release of no. conclusions: pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, p. gingivalis and prev. intermedia, and commensals, s. salivarius and v. atypica, as regards the upregulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes. interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. understanding the coordinated regulation of am and no production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.

TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == feed supplementation with red seaweeds, chondrus crispus and sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii, affects performance, egg quality, and gut microbiota of layer hens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the inclusion of red seaweed  supplementation to standard poultry diets on production performance, egg quality, intestinal histology, and cecal short-chain fatty acids in lohmann brown classic  laying hens. a total of 160 birds were randomly assigned to 8 treatment groups. control hens were fed a basal layer diet; positive control hens were fed a diet containing 2% inulin; and 6 treatment groups were fed a diet containing one of the following; 0.5, 1, or 2% chondrus crispus (cc0.5, cc1, and cc2, respectively) and one of the same 3 levels of sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii (sg0.5, sg1, and sg2,  respectively). dietary supplementation had no significant effect on the feed intake, bw, egg production, fecal moisture content, and blood serum profile of the birds. the feed conversion ratio per gram of egg was significantly more efficient (p = 0.001) for cc2 and sg2 treatments. moreover, sg1 supplementation increased egg yolk weight (p = 0.0035) and birds with cc1 supplementation had higher egg weight (p = 0.0006). the sg2 and cc2 groups had greater (p < 0.05) villus height and villus surface area compared with the control birds. seaweed supplementation increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria [e.g., bifidobacterium longum (4- to 14-fold), streptococcus salivarius (4- to 15-fold)] and importantly reduced the prevalence of clostridium perfringens in the gut of the chicken. additionally, the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids, including acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, and i-butyric acid, were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in cc and sg treatments than in the control. in conclusion, dietary supplementation using red seaweed inclusions can act as a potential prebiotic to improve performance, egg quality, and overall gut health in layer hens.

TI  == genomics of streptococcus salivarius, a major human commensal.
AB  == the salivarius group of streptococci is of particular importance for humans. this group consists of three genetically similar species, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus thermophilus. s. salivarius and s. vestibularis are commensal organisms that may occasionally cause opportunistic infections in humans, whereas s. thermophilus is a food bacterium widely used in  dairy production. we developed multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and comparative  genomic analysis to confirm the clear separation of these three species. these analyses also identified a subgroup of four strains, with a core genome diverging by about 10%, in terms of its nucleotide sequence, from that of s. salivarius sensu stricto. s. thermophilus species displays a low level of nucleotide variability, due to its recent emergence with the development of agriculture. by  contrast, nucleotide variability is high in the other two species of the salivarius group, reflecting their long-standing association with humans. the species of the salivarius group have genome sizes ranging from the smallest ( approximately 1.7mb for s. thermophilus) to the largest ( approximately 2.3mb for s. salivarius) among streptococci, reflecting genome reduction linked to a narrow, nutritionally rich environment for s. thermophilus, and natural, more competitive niches for the other two species. analyses of genomic content have indicated that the core genes of s. salivarius account for about two thirds of the genome, indicating considerable variability of gene content and differences in potential adaptive features. furthermore, we showed that the genome of this species is exceptionally rich in genes encoding surface factors, glycosyltransferases and response regulators. evidence of widespread genetic exchanges was obtained, probably involving a natural competence system and the presence of diverse mobile elements. however, although the s. salivarius strains  studied were isolated from several human body-related sites (all levels of the digestive tract, skin, breast milk, and body fluids) and included clinical strains, no genetic or genomic niche-specific features could be identified to discriminate specific group.

TI  == cariogenic bacteria and dental health status in adolescents: the role of oral health behaviours.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the association between dental health status and levels of cariogenic bacteria in teenagers and the influence of behaviours and socio-demographic background on levels of bacteria. materials and methods: study  design: a cross-sectional population-based sample of 13-year-old adolescents (112 females and 78 males, total 190) was examined. the number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs), plaque and hygiene index were recorded according to the who criteria. the saliva samples were collected in a sterile container and then analysed by culture on mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar for mutans streptococci and on man rogosa sharp (mrs) agar for lactobacilli. the levels of bacteria were expressed as the number of colonies forming units per millilitre of saliva (cfu/ml). associations between levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and dental health were estimated by odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) using unconditional logistic regression. results: no mutans streptococci were detected in 53.2% of the adolescents but 22.6% presented >/= 10(3) cfu/ml. for lactobacilli, these values were, respectively 43.7% and 34.7%. after adjustment for gender and social class, the or (95% ci) for dmfs >5  was 8.66 (3.57-21.02) if mutans streptococci >/= 10(3) cfu and 2.11 (0.96-4.64) if lactobacilli >/= 10(3) cfu. conclusion: this data allow us to conclude that hygiene habits and dental visits are not associated with high levels of cariogenic bacteria, but high scores of dmfs were found in adolescents with high  levels of mutans streptococci and lower parents' education.

TI  == identification of host-immune response protein candidates in the sera of human oral squamous cell carcinoma patients.
AB  == one of the most common cancers worldwide is oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc),  which is associated with a significant death rate and has been linked to several  risk factors. notably, failure to detect these neoplasms at an early stage represents a fundamental barrier to improving the survival and quality of life of oscc patients. in the present study, serum samples from oscc patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) and silver staining in order to identify biomarkers that might allow early diagnosis. in this regard, 2-de spots corresponding to various  up- and down-regulated proteins were sequenced via high-resolution maldi-tof mass spectrometry and analyzed using the mascot database. we identified the following  differentially expressed host-specific proteins within sera from oscc patients: leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein (lrg), alpha-1-b-glycoprotein (abg), clusterin (clu), pro2044, haptoglobin (hap), complement c3c (c3), proapolipoprotein a1 (proapo-a1), and retinol-binding protein 4 precursor (rbp4). moreover, five non-host factors were detected, including bacterial antigens from acinetobacter lwoffii, burkholderia multivorans, myxococcus xanthus, laribacter hongkongensis,  and streptococcus salivarius. subsequently, we analyzed the immunogenicity of these proteins using pooled sera from oscc patients. in this regard, five of these candidate biomarkers were found to be immunoreactive: clu, hap, c3, proapo-a1 and rbp4. taken together, our immunoproteomics approach has identified  various serum biomarkers that could facilitate the development of early diagnostic tools for oscc.

TI  == functional screening of antibiotic resistance genes from a representative metagenomic library of food fermenting microbiota.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) represent the predominant microbiota in fermented foods. foodborne lab have received increasing attention as potential reservoir of antibiotic resistance (ar) determinants, which may be horizontally transferred to opportunistic pathogens. we have previously reported isolation of ar lab from the raw ingredients of a fermented cheese, while ar genes could be detected in the final, marketed product only by pcr amplification, thus pointing at the need for  more sensitive microbial isolation techniques. we turned therefore to construction of a metagenomic library containing microbial dna extracted directly from the food matrix. to maximize yield and purity and to ensure that genomic complexity of the library was representative of the original bacterial population, we defined a suitable protocol for total dna extraction from cheese which can also be applied to other lipid-rich foods. functional library screening on different antibiotics allowed recovery of ampicillin and kanamycin resistant clones originating from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus genomes. we report molecular characterization of the cloned inserts, which were fully sequenced and shown to confer ar phenotype to recipient bacteria. we also show that metagenomics can be applied to food microbiota to identify underrepresented species carrying specific genes of interest.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 during manufacture and storage of white brined cheese.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is a major foodborne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. survival of e. coli o157:h7 during processing and storage of white brined cheese was investigated. cheeses were prepared using pasteurized milk inoculated with a 4 strain e. coli o157:h7 cocktail (7 log(10) cfu/g) with or without yogurt starter culture (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus) and stored in 10% or 15% nacl brine at 10 and 21 masculinec for 28 d. nacl concentration, water activity (a(w)), ph,  and numbers of e. coli o157:h7 and lactic acid bacteria (lab) were determined in  cheese and brine. e. coli o157:h7 was able to survive in cheese stored in both brines at 10 and 21 masculinec regardless of the presence of starter lab, although the latter significantly enhanced e. coli o157:h7 reduction in cheese or its brine at 10 masculinec. e. coli o157:h7 numbers were reduced by 2.6 and 3.4 log(10) cfu/g in cheese stored in 10% and 15% nacl brine, respectively, in the presence of starter lab and by 1.4 and 2.3 log(10) cfu/g, respectively, in the absence of starter lab at 10 masculinec. the pathogen survived, but at lower numbers in the brines. the salt concentration of cheese stored in 10% brine remained about 5% during ripening, but in 15% brine, the nacl level increased 1.6% to 8.1% (w/w) by 28 d. values of ph and a(w) slightly decreased 1 d after exposure to brine and reached 5.5 to 6.6 and 0.88 to 0.94, respectively, in all treatments.

TI  == the oral commensal streptococcus mitis shows a mixed memory th cell signature that is similar to and cross-reactive with streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: carriage of and infection with streptococcus pneumoniae is known to predominantly induce t helper 17 (th17) responses in humans, but the types of th  cells showing reactivity towards commensal streptococci with low pathogenic potential, such as the oral commensals s. mitis and s. salivarius, remain uncharacterized. methods: memory cd4(+) t helper (th) cell subsets were isolated  from healthy human blood donors according to differential expression of chemokine receptors, expanded in vitro using polyclonal stimuli and characterized for reactivity against different streptococcal strains. results: th cells responding  to s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were predominantly in a ccr6(+)cxcr3(+) subset and produced ifn-gamma, and in a ccr6(+)ccr4(+) subset and produced il-17 and il-22. frequencies of s. pneumoniae-reactive th cells were higher than frequencies of s. mitis- and s. salivarius-specific th cells. s. mitis and s. pneumoniae isogenic capsule knock-out mutants and a s. mitis mutant  expressing the serotype 4 capsule of s. pneumoniae showed no different th cell responses as compared to wild type strains. s. mitis-specific th17 cells showed cross-reactivity with s. pneumoniae. conclusions: as th17 cells partly control clearance of s. pneumoniae, cross-reactive th17 cells that may be induced by commensal bacterial species may influence the immune response, independent of capsule expression.

TI  == [a case of multiple liver abscesses associated with streptococcus salivarius in a patient with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is an oral commensal bacterium that rarely causes disease in humans. here, we report a case of liver abscess associated with s. salivarius in a 41-year-old woman who presented with continuous abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and fever. she was diagnosed with multiple liver abscesses;  she underwent percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage. thereafter, s. salivarius was isolated in all bacterial cultures of the drained abscesses, and it was sensitive to penicillins. she made a good recovery after treatment. in the absence of an infective source other than chronic periodontitis, the cause of liver abscesses was attributed to oral s. salivarius. s. salivarius is a normal oral commensal, and oral commensals must be considered if the infective origin of liver abscess cannot be determined.

TI  == molecular identification and antibiotic resistant bacteria isolated from primary  dentition infections.
AB  == background: bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a health problem in many parts of the world. the aim of this study was to identify bacteria from dental infections and determine bacterial resistance to antibiotics used in dental care  in the primary dentition. methods: this cross-sectional study comprised 60 children who presented for dental treatment for active dental infections in the primary dentition. samples from dental infections were collected and bacteria were identified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. bacterial resistance to antibiotics was determined by colony forming units on agar plates containing amoxicillin, clindamycin and amoxillicin-clavulanic acid (a-ca) tested at 8 mug/ml or 16 mug/ml. results: clindamycin in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml) showed the highest bacterial resistance (85.9%), followed by amoxicillin (43.7%) and a-ca (12.0%). all comparisons among the three antibiotics used in the study exhibited statistical significance (p = <0.05) in both concentrations tested (8 mug/ml and 16 mug/ml), and under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the most prevalent resistant species identified by pcr in primary dentition infections were: streptococcus oralis and prevotella intermedia (75.0%); treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis (48.3%); streptococcus  mutans (45.0%); campylobacter rectus; and streptococcus salivarius (40%). conclusions: this study demonstrated that a-ca exhibited the lowest bacterial resistance for clinical isolates in primary dentition infections.

TI  == parallel evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis to pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles.
AB  == the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans. intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. in a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into  a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i.e., from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae. import of genes from s. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae. our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. while genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. importance: one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. we have shown  that the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports  genes from s. mitis and other related streptococci. this process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.

TI  == nanoscopic vibrations of bacteria with different cell-wall properties adhering to surfaces under flow and static conditions.
AB  == bacteria adhering to surfaces demonstrate random, nanoscopic vibrations around their equilibrium positions. this paper compares vibrational amplitudes of bacteria adhering to glass. spring constants of the bond are derived from vibrational amplitudes and related to the electrophoretic softness of the cell surfaces and dissipation shifts measured upon bacterial adhesion in a quartz-crystal-microbalance (qcm-d). experiments were conducted with six bacterial strains with pairwise differences in cell surface characteristics. vibrational amplitudes were highest in low ionic strength suspensions. under fluid flow, vibrational amplitudes were lower in the direction of flow than perpendicular to it because stretching of cell surface polymers in the direction  of flow causes stiffening of the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium. under static conditions (0.57 mm), vibrational amplitudes of fibrillated streptococcus salivarius hb7 (145 nm) were higher than that of a bald mutant hb-c12 (76 nm). amplitudes of moderately extracellular polymeric substance (eps)  producing staphylococcus epidermidis atcc35983 (47 nm) were more than twice the amplitudes of strongly eps producing s. epidermidis atcc35984 (21 nm). no differences were found between staphylococcus aureus strains differing in membrane cross-linking. high vibrational amplitudes corresponded with low dissipation shifts in qcm-d. in streptococci, the polyelectrolyte network surrounding a bacterium is formed by fibrillar surface appendages and spring constants derived from vibrational amplitudes decreased with increasing fibrillar density. in staphylococci, eps constitutes the main network component, and larger amounts of eps yielded higher spring constants. spring constants increased with increasing ionic strength and strains with smaller electrophoretically derived bacterial cell surface softnesses possessed the highest spring constants.

TI  == using color histograms and spa-lda to classify bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

AB  == four gram-stain-positive, catalase-negative, coccoid-shaped organisms were isolated from elephant oral cavities. the isolates were tentatively identified as streptococcal species based on the results of biochemical tests. comparative 16s  rrna gene sequencing studies confirmed the organisms to be members of the genus streptococcus. two isolates (num 6304(t) and num 6312) were related most closely  to streptococcus salivarius with 96.8 % and 93.1 % similarity based on the 16s rrna gene and the rna polymerase beta subunit encoding gene (rpob), respectively, and to streptococcus vestibularis with 83.7 % similarity based on the 60 kda heat-shock protein gene (groel). the other two isolates (num 6306(t) and num 6318) were related most closely to s. vestibularis with 97.0 % and 82.9 % similarity based on the 16s rrna and groel genes, respectively, and to s. salivarius with 93.5 % similarity based on the rpob gene. based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, these isolates are suggested to represent novel species  of the genus streptococcus, for which the names streptococcus loxodontisalivarius sp. nov. (type strain num 6304(t) = jcm 19287(t) = dsm 27382(t)) and streptococcus saliviloxodontae sp. nov. (type strain num 6306(t) = jcm 19288(t) = dsm 27513(t)) are proposed.

TI  == comparative genomics of the bacterial genus streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  == members of the genus streptococcus within the phylum firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. this genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic  approaches, dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing. it is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". however, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. we use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced  strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including pyogenic, bovis, mutans and salivarius groups, and the other including mitis, anginosus and unknown groups. phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. we suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus salivarius on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == dental caries arises from an imbalance of metabolic activities in dental biofilms developed primarily by streptococcus mutans. this study was conducted to isolate  potential oral probiotics with antagonistic activities against s. mutans biofilm  formation from lactobacillus salivarius, frequently found in human saliva. we analysed 64 l. salivarius strains and found that two, k35 and k43, significantly  inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation with inhibitory activities more pronounced  than those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), a prototypical probiotic that shows anti-caries activity. scanning electron microscopy showed that co-culture of s. mutans with k35 or k43 resulted in significantly reduced amounts of attached bacteria and network-like structures, typically comprising exopolysaccharides. spot assay for s. mutans indicated that k35 and k43 strains possessed a stronger bactericidal activity against s. mutans than lgg. moreover,  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of genes encoding glucosyltransferases, gtfb, gtfc, and gtfd was reduced when s. mutans were co-cultured with k35 or k43. however, lgg activated the expression of gtfb and gtfc, but did not influence the expression of gtfd in the co-culture. a  transwell-based biofilm assay indicated that these lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation in a contact-independent manner. in conclusion, we identified two l. salivarius strains with inhibitory activities on the growth and expression of s. mutans virulence genes to reduce its biofilm formation. this is  not a general characteristic of the species, so presents a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.

TI  == the ph-dependent expression of the urease operon in streptococcus salivarius is mediated by cody.
AB  == urease gene expression in streptococcus salivarius 57.i, a strain of one of the major alkali producers in the mouth, is induced by acidic ph and excess amounts of carbohydrate. expression is controlled primarily at the transcriptional level  from a promoter, purei. recent sequencing analysis revealed a cody box located 2  bases 5' to the -35 element of purei. using continuous chemostat culture, transcription from purei was shown to be repressed by cody, and at ph 7 the repression was more pronounced than that in cells grown at ph 5.5 under both 20 and 100 mm glucose. the direct binding of cody to purei was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip)-quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). the result of chip-qpcr also confirmed  that the regulation of cody is indeed modulated by ph and the binding of cody at  neutral ph is further enhanced by a limited supply of glucose (20 mm). in the absence of cody, the c-terminal domain of the rna polymerase (rnap) alpha subunit interacted with the at tracks within the cody box, indicating that cody and rnap  compete for the same binding region. such regulation could ensure optimal urease  expression when the enzyme is most required, i.e., at an acidic growth ph with an excess amount of carbon nutrients.

TI  == silver deposition on titanium surface by electrochemical anodizing process reduces bacterial adhesion of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial properties of silver-doped titanium surfaces prepared with a novel electrochemical anodizing process. material and methods: titanium samples were anodized with a pulsed process in a solution of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulphate at room temperature with stirring. samples were processed with different electrolyte concentrations and treatment cycles to improve silver deposition. physicochemical properties were determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, white-light interferometry, and scanning electron microscopy. cellular cytotoxicity in human fibroblasts was studied with lactate dehydrogenase assays. the in vitro effect of treated surfaces on two oral bacteria strains (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) was studied with viable bacterial adhesion measurements and growth curve assays. nonparametric statistical kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney u-tests were used for multiple and paired comparisons, respectively. post hoc spearman's correlation tests were calculated to check the dependence between bacteria adhesion and surface properties. results: x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results confirmed the presence of silver on treated samples and showed that treatments with higher silver nitrate concentration and more cycles increased the silver deposition on titanium surface. no negative effects in fibroblast cell viability were detected  and a significant reduction on bacterial adhesion in vitro was achieved in silver-treated samples compared with control titanium. conclusions: silver deposition on titanium with a novel electrochemical anodizing process produced surfaces with significant antibacterial properties in vitro without negative effects on cell viability.

AB  == oral veillonella, veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, veillonella rogosae, and veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. to investigate the role  of oral veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or streptococcus sanguinis, with  oral veillonella were examined at the species level. the amount of biofilm formed by s. mutans, s. gordonii, and s. salivarius in the presence of the six veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of s. mutans with v. dispar. in contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by s. sanguinis, the presence of veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of v. parvula and v. dispar. the time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. only that of s. gordonii with v. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. these results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. it is possible that there may be  several factors involved in the interaction between streptococcus and veillonella species.

AB  == competence for natural dna transformation is a tightly controlled developmental process in streptococci. in mutans and salivarius species, the abundance of the central competence regulator sigma(x) is regulated at two levels: transcriptional, by the comrs signaling system via the sigma(x)/comx/sigx-inducing peptide (xip), and posttranscriptional, by the adaptor protein meca and its associated clp atpase, clpc. in this study, we further investigated the mechanism and function of the meca-clpc control system in the salivarius species streptococcus thermophilus. using in vitro approaches,  we showed that meca specifically interacts with both sigma(x) and clpc, suggesting the formation of a ternary sigma(x)-meca-clpc complex. moreover, we demonstrated that meca ultimately targets sigma(x) for its degradation by the clpcp protease in an atp-dependent manner. we also identify a short sequence (18  amino acids) in the n-terminal domain of sigma(x) as essential for the interaction with meca and subsequent sigma(x) degradation. finally, increased transformability of a meca-deficient strain in the presence of subinducing xip concentrations suggests that the meca-clpcp proteolytic complex acts as an additional locking device to prevent competence under inappropriate conditions. a model of the interplay between comrs and meca-clpcp in the control of sigma(x) activity is proposed.

TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == investigating the effects of probiotics on pneumococcal colonization using an in  vitro adherence assay.
AB  == adherence of streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) to the epithelial lining of the nasopharynx can result in colonization and is considered a prerequisite for pneumococcal infections such as pneumonia and otitis media. in vitro adherence assays can be used to study the attachment of pneumococci to epithelial cell monolayers and to investigate potential interventions, such as the use of probiotics, to inhibit pneumococcal colonization. the protocol described here is  used to investigate the effects of the probiotic streptococcus salivarius on the  adherence of pneumococci to the human epithelial cell line ccl-23 (sometimes referred to as hep-2 cells). the assay involves three main steps: 1) preparation  of epithelial and bacterial cells, 2) addition of bacteria to epithelial cell monolayers, and 3) detection of adherent pneumococci by viable counts (serial dilution and plating) or quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). this technique is relatively straightforward and does not require specialized equipment other than  a tissue culture setup. the assay can be used to test other probiotic species and/or potential inhibitors of pneumococcal colonization and can be easily modified to address other scientific questions regarding pneumococcal adherence and invasion.

TI  == poultry farm hygiene: microbiological quality assessment of drinking water used in layer chickens managed under the battery cage and deep litter systems at three poultry farms in southwestern nigeria.
AB  == water troughs from deep litter and caged chicken water troughs (drinkers) fixed to each of the different 3-tier cages containing layer chickens in farms a, b and c were subjected to a 7-day study which involved the monitoring of poultry farm hygiene. drinkers were washed before filling with water on day 1. for days 3, 5 and 7 water was served without prior washing. the occurrence and characterization of the bacteria isolates were investigated and data obtained were analyzed and compared. for the bacterial count on day 1, for layer chickens on cage system, no significant differences (p > 0.05) among the farms and between the farms tier interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on day 5, there was significant difference (p<0.05) among the farms and on day 7, there was high significant difference (p < 0.01) among the farms. on days 5 and 7, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) among the tiers nor between the interactions of the farms and tiers. the bacterial count in water troughs of layer chickens in deep litter system, on day 1, had no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the farms, water troughs and their interactions. on day 3, no significant difference (p > 0.05) among the parameters. on days 5 and 7, there were significant difference (p<0.05) and a high significant difference (p < 0.01) between the farms respectively. on days 5 and 7, no significant differences between the water troughs and between the interaction of  the farms and the water troughs. farm a isolates contained staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermis, klebsiella sp., salmonella sp., bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus salivarius and corynebacterium sp. farm b had staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium sp., escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis and klebsiella sp. while for farm c, apart from the prevalent bacteria isolates obtained in farms a and b, additional 2 bacterial isolates, lactobacillus salivarius and pseudomonas aeuriginosa were found. in conclusion, water troughs when cleaned on daily basis carry minimum bacterial load. those left for 3, 5 and 7 days uncleaned had progressively high bacterial loads, suggesting that the flock of birds and the consumers of the eggs and meat  from the chickens are at risk of bacterial infection unless strict farm hygiene is ensured through regular monitoring.

TI  == covalent immobilization of hlf1-11 peptide on a titanium surface reduces bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.
AB  == bacterial infection represents a major cause of implant failure in dentistry. a common approach to overcoming this issue and treating peri-implant infection consists in the use of antibiotics. however, the rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria poses serious concerns to this strategy. a promising alternative is the  use of antimicrobial peptides due to their broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and reduced bacterial resistance responses. the aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro antibacterial activity of the human lactoferrin-derived peptide hlf1-11 anchored to titanium surfaces. to this end, titanium samples were functionalized with the hlf1-11 peptide either by silanization methods or physical adsorption. x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the successful covalent attachment of the hlf1-11 peptide onto titanium surfaces. lactate dehydrogenase assay determined that hlf1-11 peptide did not affect fibroblast viability. an outstanding reduction in the adhesion and early stages of biofilm formation of streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius was observed on the biofunctionalized surfaces compared to control non-treated samples. furthermore, samples coated with the hlf1-11 peptide inhibited the early stages of bacterial growth. thus, this strategy holds great potential to develop antimicrobial biomaterials for dental applications.

TI  == the role of microbiota in hepatic encephalopathy.
AB  == hepatic encephalopathy (he), which consists of minimal (mhe) and overt (ohe) stages, is a model for impaired gut-liver-brain axis in cirrhosis. microbiota changes in both stages have been associated with impaired cognition, endotoxemia, and inflammation. there is dysbiosis (reduced autochthonous taxa [lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, and clostridiales xiv] and increased enterobacteriaceae and streptococcaceae) with disease progression. in mhe, there  is an increased abundance of streptococcus salivarius linked to cognition and ammonia. in ohe, stool alcaligenaceae and porphyromonadaceae are associated with  poor cognition. colonic mucosal microbiome in cirrhosis is significantly different compared with stool and independently related to cognition. he treatment can affect microbial composition and function; cognitive improvement in mhe after rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, occurred without significant stool microbiota composition change but improved metabolic linkages. similarly, there are only modest lactulose and rifaximin-associated changes on microbiota composition in ohe. he represents an important model to study microbiome-brain interactions.

TI  == theoretical investigation of bacteria polarizability under direct current electric fields.
AB  == we present a theoretical model to investigate the influence of soft polyelectrolyte layers on bacteria polarizability. we resolve soft-layer electrokinetics by considering the ph-dependent dissociation of ionogenic groups  and specific interactions of ionogenic groups with the bulk electrolyte to go beyond approximating soft-layer electrokinetics as surface conduction. we model the electrokinetics around a soft particle by modified poisson-nernst-planck equations (pnp) to account for the effects of ion transport in the soft layer and electric double layer. fluid flow is modeled by modified stokes equations accounting for soft-layer permeability. two test cases are presented to demonstrate our model: fibrillated and unfibrillated streptococcus salivarius bacteria. we show that electrolytic and ph conditions significantly influence the extent of soft-particle polarizability in dc fields. comparison with an approximate analytical model based on dukhin-shilov theory for soft particles shows the importance of resolving soft-layer electrokinetics. insights from this  study can be useful in understanding the parameters that influence soft-particle  dielectrophoresis in lab-on-a-chip devices.

TI  == altered bacterial profiles in saliva from adults with caries lesions: a case-cohort study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to learn whether presence of caries in an adult population was associated with a salivary bacterial profile different from that of individuals without untreated caries. stimulated saliva samples from 621 participants of the danish health examination survey were analyzed using the human oral microbe identification microarray technology. samples from 174 individuals with dental caries and 447 from a control cohort were compared using  frequency and levels of identified bacterial taxa/clusters as endpoints. differences at taxon/cluster level were analyzed using mann-whitney's test with benjamini-hochberg correction for multiple comparisons. principal component analysis was used to visualize bacterial community profiles. a reduced bacterial  diversity was observed in samples from subjects with dental caries. five bacterial taxa (veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica, megasphaera micronuciformis, fusobacterium periodontium and achromobacter xylosoxidans) and one bacterial cluster (leptotrichia sp. clones c3mkm102 and gt018_ot417/462) were less frequently found in the caries group (adjusted p value <0.01) while two bacterial taxa (solobacterium moorei and streptococcus salivarius) and three bacterial clusters (streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sp. clone be024_ot057/411/721, streptococcus parasanguinis i and ii and sinensis_ot411/721/767, streptococcus salivarius and sp. clone fo042_ot067/755) were present at significantly higher levels (adjusted p value <0.01). the principal component analysis displayed a marked difference in the bacterial community profiles between groups. presence of manifest caries was associated with a reduced diversity and an altered salivary bacterial community profile. our data support recent theories that ecological stress-induced changes of commensal  microbial communities are involved in the shift from oral health to tooth decay.

TI  == the influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfp, on biofilm formation by  streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. in vitro, s. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. the present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. inactivation of the gtfp gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the  s. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type s. sanguinis, but not the gtfp-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence  of 1% (w/v) sucrose. in addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. by contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. anginosus, or s. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfp gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. furthermore, inactivating the gtfp gene did not greatly alter the proportion of s. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. thus, despite the role of s. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.

TI  == phylogenomics and the dynamic genome evolution of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the genus streptococcus comprises important pathogens that have a severe impact on human health and are responsible for substantial economic losses to agriculture. here, we utilize 46 streptococcus genome sequences (44 species), including eight species sequenced here, to provide the first genomic level insight into the evolutionary history and genetic basis underlying the functional diversity of all major groups of this genus. gene gain/loss analysis revealed a dynamic pattern of genome evolution characterized by an initial period of gene gain followed by a period of loss, as the major groups within the genus diversified. this was followed by a period of genome expansion associated with the origins of the present extant species. the pattern is concordant with an emerging view that genomes evolve through a dynamic process of expansion and streamlining. a large proportion of the pan-genome has experienced lateral gene transfer (lgt) with causative factors, such as relatedness and shared environment, operating over different evolutionary scales. multiple gene ontology terms were significantly enriched for each group, and mapping terms onto the phylogeny showed that those corresponding to genes born on branches leading to the major groups represented approximately one-fifth of those enriched. furthermore, despite the extensive lgt, several biochemical characteristics have  been retained since group formation, suggesting genomic cohesiveness through time, and that these characteristics may be fundamental to each group. for example, proteolysis: mitis group; urea metabolism: salivarius group; carbohydrate metabolism: pyogenic group; and transcription regulation: bovis group.

TI  == effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  == aim: recent uk national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients  undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (ie), and  advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. as viridans group streptococci (vgs) are common etiological agents of ie and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of vgs organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). methods: the survival of vgs, streptococcus gordonii (national collection of type cultures [nctc] 7865), streptococcus intermedius (nctc 11324), streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), streptococcus oralis (nctc 11427), streptococcus pneumoniae (nctc 7465, nctc 7978, & american type culture collection 49619) and streptococcus salivarius (nctc 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. results: no organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. conclusions: these data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill vgs organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of ie.

TI  == the loss of topography in the microbial communities of the upper respiratory tract in the elderly.
AB  == rationale: the microbial communities inhabiting the upper respiratory tract protect from respiratory infection. the maturity of the immune system is a major  influence on the composition of the microbiome and, in youth, the microbiota and  immune system are believed to mature in tandem. with age, immune function declines and susceptibility to respiratory infection increases. whether these changes contribute to the microbial composition of the respiratory tract is unknown. objectives: our goal was to determine whether the microbes of the upper  respiratory tract differ between mid-aged adults (18-40 yr) and the elderly (>65  yr). methods: microbiomes of the anterior nares and oropharynx of elderly individuals were evaluated by 16s rrna gene sequencing. these communities were compared with data on mid-aged adults obtained from the human microbiome project. measurements and main results: the microbiota of the elderly showed no associations with sex, comorbidities, residence, or vaccinations. comparisons of  mid-aged adults and the elderly demonstrated significant differences in the composition of the anterior nares and oropharynx, including a population in the anterior nares of the elderly that more closely resembled the oropharynx than the anterior nares of adults. the elderly oropharyngeal microbiota were characterized by increased abundance of streptococci, specifically, streptococcus salivarius group species, but not streptococcus pneumoniae, carriage of which was low (<3% of participants), as demonstrated by pcr (n = 4/123). conclusions: microbial populations of the upper respiratory tract in mid-aged adults and the elderly differ; it is possible that these differences contribute to the increased risk of respiratory infections experienced by the elderly.

TI  == use of streptococcus salivarius k12 in the prevention of streptococcal and viral  pharyngotonsillitis in children.
AB  == background: streptococcus salivarius k12 is an oral probiotic strain releasing two lantibiotics (salivaricin a2 and salivaricin b) that antagonize the growth of s. pyogenes, the most important bacterial cause of pharyngeal infections in humans also affected by episodes of acute otitis media. s. salivarius k12 successfully colonizes the oral cavity, and is endowed with an excellent safety profile. we tested its preventive role in reducing the incidence of both streptococcal and viral pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis in children. materials and methods: we enrolled 61 children with a diagnosis of recurrent oral streptococcal disorders. thirty-one of them were enrolled to be treated daily for 90 days with  a slow-release tablet for oral use, containing no less than 1 billion colony-forming units/tablet of s. salivarius k12 (bactoblis(r)), and the remaining 30 served as the untreated control group. during treatment, they were all examined for streptococcal infection. twenty children (ten per group) were also assessed in terms of viral infection. secondary end points in both groups were the number of days under antibiotic and antipyretic therapy and the number of days off school (children) and off work (parents). results: the 30 children who completed the 90-day trial with bactoblis(r) showed a significant reduction in their episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infection (>90%), as calculated by  comparing the infection rates of the previous year. no difference was observed in the control group. the treated group showed a significant decrease in the incidence (80%) of oral viral infections. again, there was no difference in the control group. with regard to secondary end points, the number of days under antibiotic treatment of the treated and control groups were 30 and 900 respectively, days under antipyretic treatment 16 and 228, days of absence from school 16 and 228, and days of absence from work 16 and 228. the product was well tolerated by the subjects, with no side effects, and only one individual reported bad product palatability and dropped out. conclusion: prophylactic administration of s. salivarius k12 to children with a history of recurrent oral streptococcal disease resulted in a considerable reduction of episodes of both streptococcal and viral infections and reduced the number of days under antibiotic and/or antipyretic therapy and days of absence from school or work.

TI  == photodynamic therapy versus ultrasonic irrigation: interaction with endodontic microbial biofilm, an ex vivo study.
AB  == introduction: photodynamic therapy was introduced as an adjuvant to conventional  chemo-mechanical debridement during endodontic treatment to overcome the persistence of biofilms. the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of photodynamic therapy (pdt) to disrupt an experimental microbial biofilm inside the root canal in a clinically applicable working time. materials and methods: thirty extracted teeth were prepared and then divided in three groups. all samples were infected with an artificially formed biofilm made of enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia bacteria. first group was treated with aseptim plus(r) photo-activated (led) disinfection system, second group by a 650 nm diode laser and toluidine blue as photosensitizer, and the third group, as control group, by ultrasonic irrigation (pui) using edta 17% and naocl 2.6% solutions. the working time for all three groups was fixed at 3 min. presence or absence of biofilm was assessed  by aerobic and anaerobic cultures. results: there was no statistically significant difference between results obtained from groups treated by aseptim plus(r) and diode laser (p<0.6267). in cultures of both groups there was a maximal bacterial growth. the group that was treated by ultrasonic irrigation and naocl and edta solutions had the best results (p<0.0001): there was a statistically significant reduction of bacterial load and destruction of microbial biofilm. conclusion: under the condition of this study, photodynamic therapy could not disrupt endodontic artificial microbial biofilm and could not inhibit bacterial growth in a clinically favorable working time.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == pcr applications in identification of saliva samples exposed to different conditions (streptococci detection based).
AB  == oral streptococci represent about 20% of the total oral bacteria, so if it is possible to detect the presence of oral specific bacteria from a forensic specimen by polymerase chain reaction, this could be used to verify the presence  of saliva. aim of this study is detection of streptococcus salivarius which is one of the most common streptococci in oral bacteria and streptococcus mutans which is common in cases of dental caries in various body fluids and skin swabs and assessment of which one of both organisms is more reliable in saliva identification, cross sectional study on egypt population. negative control samples (15 samples) were taken from various body fluids (urine, semen) and skin  swabs. mock forensic samples (85 samples) included fresh saliva, saliva, cotton fabrics contaminated with saliva, cigarette butts, bitten apple and semen mixed with saliva samples). dna extraction was done using dneasy blood and tissue kit (qiagen, tokyo, japan). polymerase chain reaction was done for dna amplification  using polymerase chain reaction master mix then gel electrophoresis was done for  samples qualification. control bacteria were s. salivarius and streptococcus mutans. streptococcus salivarius was detected in 83.5% of all saliva contained samples and s. mutans was detected in 67% of saliva contained samples. both bacteria were not detected in other body fluids and skin swabs, so s. salivarius  is more reliable in saliva identification as well as differentiating it from other body fluids. polymerase chain reaction is valuable in detection of saliva by detecting s. salivarius.

TI  == spontaneous meningitis due to streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius: cross-reaction in an assay with a rapid diagnostic kit that detected streptococcus pneumoniae antigens.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. salivarius occasionally causes meningitis associated with iatrogenic or traumatic events. we herein describe a case of meningitis caused by this organism in a patient without any apparent risk factors. in an assay of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid, cross-reaction occurred with streptococcus pneumoniae antigen-coated latex particles in the pastorex meningitis kit. in the in vitro assays, three of the five clinically isolated s. salivarius strains showed cross-reactions with the kit, indicating that these strains expressed pneumococcal antigen-like antigens. this case shows  that meningitis caused by s. salivarius can occur spontaneously and it may sometimes be misdiagnosed as s. pneumoniae infection.

TI  == antibacterial activity of selected glass ionomer cements.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the paper was to determine the antibacterial activity of four glass ionomer cements against bacteria of the genera streptococcus and lactobacillus. material and methods: four capsulated glass ionomer cements were applied in the study: fuji triage (gc), fuji ix (gc), ketac molar (3m espe) and ketac silver (3m espe). four standard bacterial strains were used to assess the antibacterial activity of the studied cements: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis,  s. salivarius and lactobacillus casei. the antibacterial activity was determined  by the agar diffusion method. the bacterial suspension was spread with a cotton swab on tsa plates. for each material six wells (7 mm diameter, 5 mm deep) were made with a cork borer. each well was then filled with freshly prepared cements.  the results were obtained by measuring the bacterial growth inhibition zone after 1, 2, 3 and 7 days. results: fuji triage cement inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains. fuji ix cement demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against s. sanguis. ketac molar showed antibacterial activity against s. sanguis and s. salivarius, whereas ketac silver was efficient against s. mutans as well. neither of the ketac cements inhibited growth of the standard l. casei strain. discussion: antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements has attracted the interest of scientists in recent years. most authors, including us, carried out experiments using the agar diffusion method and demonstrated antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements. different antibacterial activity of glass ionomer cements, observed in our study and studies of other authors, depended on  the evaluated cement, bacterial strain and period of evaluation.

TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == destructive subependymal cysts following ventriculitis-pathomechanisms and treatment.
AB  == ventriculitis may complicate neurosurgical procedures, for example, due to shunt  or external ventricular drainage infection. clearance of the infection with subsequent intravenous antibiotic therapy and shunt reinsertion, if necessary, are the standard treatment procedures with a high rate of success. here, we report on a protracted complication, the development of destructive subependymal  cysts, illustrate its treatment and discuss the pathomechanisms. the 2-year-and-9-month-old girl was admitted 5 weeks after a shunt revision with symptoms of shunt infection. ventriculitis caused by streptococcus salivarius (s. salivarius) was diagnosed and intravenous antibiotic treatment was performed. a new shunt system was implanted after clearance of infection and the girl did not  show clinical signs of infection thereafter. a routine follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (mri) revealed progressive and space-occupying multifocal subependymal cysts with partial destruction of the corpus callosum including compression of the ventricular system. endoscopic broad-based laser fenestration  of all cysts resulted in sustained regression of cavity formation. the cognitive  development of the girl assessed 2 years afterward was completely normal. we conclude that routine follow-up mri investigations are recommended 6 months after successful treatment of ventriculitis to detect protracted postinflammatory destructive subependymal cyst formations. endoscopic broad-based laser-assisted cyst fenestration can stop progression and lead to regression of postinfectious subependymal cysts.

TI  == comparative genomics analysis of streptococcus isolates from the human small intestine reveals their adaptation to a highly dynamic ecosystem.
AB  == the human small-intestinal microbiota is characterised by relatively large and dynamic streptococcus populations. in this study, genome sequences of small-intestinal streptococci from s. mitis, s. bovis, and s. salivarius species-groups were determined and compared with those from 58 streptococcus strains in public databases. the streptococcus pangenome consists of 12,403 orthologous groups of which 574 are shared among all sequenced streptococci and are defined as the streptococcus core genome. genome mining of the small-intestinal streptococci focused on functions playing an important role in the interaction of these streptococci in the small-intestinal ecosystem, including natural competence and nutrient-transport and metabolism. analysis of the small-intestinal streptococcus genomes predicts a high capacity to synthesize amino acids and various vitamins as well as substantial divergence in their carbohydrate transport and metabolic capacities, which is in agreement with observed physiological differences between these streptococcus strains. gene-specific pcr-strategies enabled evaluation of conservation of streptococcus  populations in intestinal samples from different human individuals, revealing that the s. salivarius strains were frequently detected in the small-intestine microbiota, supporting the representative value of the genomes provided in this study. finally, the streptococcus genomes allow prediction of the effect of dietary substances on streptococcus population dynamics in the human small-intestine.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == viability of probiotic lactobacillus casei in yoghurt: defining the best processing step to its addition.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms capable of producing beneficial effects on its host when consumed in adequate amounts. to exert these effects, foods must contain probiotic microorganisms in populations above 10(6) cfu/g or ml throughout its shelf life. one of the strategies to ensure high population of probiotics in fermented milk is to add them during or after the fermentation process separately from the starter cultures. the objective of this study was to  investigate the behavior of the probiotic microorganism lactobacillus casei added to yoghurt in different stages of production. yoghurts with l. casei were produced at different stages: before addition of starter (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus),  added together with this culture and at the end of fermentation. yoghurt without  probiotic added was produced as a control. the products were stored at 4 degrees  c and analyzed after 1, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. in these periods, the populations ofprobiotic and starter cultures were enumerated and the parameters ph and acidity were analyzed. the results were evaluated using analysis of variance and tukey's test, both at 5% significance level. l. casei remained viable in populations of more than 10(8) cfu / g during 21 days of storage, which is suitable to define the formulations as probiotics. when the different stages of the addition of probiotics in yoghurts were evaluated there was no statistical difference between the formulations (p < 0.05) for populations of l. casei except for the first day of storage.

TI  == postantibiotic effect of disinfection treatment by photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the postantibiotic effect (pae)  of the disinfection treatment by photolysis of h2o2. postantibiotic effect was induced in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus salivarius by exposing the bacteria to h2o2 at concentrations of 250-1000 mmol/l, laser irradiation at a wavelength of 405 nm, and the combination of both (photolysis of h2o2) for 10-30  seconds. the photolysis of h2o2 induced significantly longer pae than other treatments. the pae was augmented dependently on not only the concentration of h2o2 but the laser irradiation time. electron spin resonance analysis showed that the hydroxyl radical was also generated dependently on both the concentration of  h2o2 and the laser irradiation time, suggesting that the hydroxyl radicals contribute to the pae. these results suggest that the disinfection treatment by photolysis of h2o2 induces pae in s. aureus and s. salivarius even though they were treated for only 10-30 seconds.

TI  == phenotypic diversity of multicellular filamentation in oral streptococci.
AB  == filamentous multicellular bacteria are among the most ancient multicellular organisms. they inhabit a great variety of environments and are present in the human body, including the oral cavity. beside the selective advantages related to the larger size achieved through filamentation, the development of multicellular  bacteria can be also driven by simple ecological factors such as birth and death  rates at the cellular level. in order to extend earlier results obtained in aquatic species, we investigate the filamentation process of four different strains of oral streptococci, namely s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. anginosus. the results indicate differences in the capacities of different streptococcus species to form filaments, manifested in terms of length and the time-scale of filament elongation. the filamentation pattern of these oral streptococci resembles that of aquatic bacteria, whereby filaments reach a peak length during exponential growth and become short when the population reaches a steady state. hence, this study validates that multicellularity can be an emergent property of filamentous bacteria of different ecological niches, and that phenotypic differences in filamentation can occur within species of the same genus, in this case oral streptococci. moreover, given the role that specific oral streptococci can play in the etiology of oral diseases, these results can possibly open new perspectives in the study of the virulence properties of these  species.

TI  == body fluid identification by integrated analysis of dna methylation and body fluid-specific microbial dna.
AB  == identification of body fluids found at crime scenes provides important information that can support a link between sample donors and actual criminal acts. previous studies have reported that dna methylation analysis at several tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tdmrs) enables successful identification of semen, and the detection of certain bacterial dna can allow for identification of saliva and vaginal fluid. in the present study, a method for detecting bacterial dna was integrated into a previously reported multiplex methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction. the developed multiplex pcr was modified by the addition of a new semen-specific marker and by  including amplicons for the 16s ribosomal rna gene of saliva- and vaginal fluid-specific bacteria to improve the efficacy to detect a specific type of body fluid. using the developed multiplex system, semen was distinguishable by unmethylation at the usp49, dact1, and pfn3 tdmrs and by hypermethylation at l81528, and saliva could be identified by detection of saliva-specific bacteria,  veillonella atypica and/or streptococcus salivarius. additionally, vaginal fluid  and menstrual blood were differentiated from other body fluids by hypomethylation at the pfn3 tdmr and the presence of vaginal fluid-specific bacteria, lactobacillus crispatus and/or lactobacillus gasseri. because the developed multiplex system uses the same biological source of dna for individual identification profiling and simultaneously analyses various types of body fluid  in one pcr reaction, this method will facilitate more efficient body fluid identification in forensic casework.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

TI  == analysis of cariogenic bacteria in saliva of cancer patients.
AB  == this study examined salivary flow and salivary ph and the prevalence and levels of cariogenic bacteria in the saliva of oncological patients and healthy controls. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess the levels of microbes including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus acidophilus in the saliva of 41 patients with a solid tumor (so), 30 patients with a hematologic malignancy (he), and 40 healthy controls. salivary flow and ph were lower in oncological patients  than in controls. the frequencies of all four cariogenic bacteria were highest in the so group. s. mutans and l. salivarius were the most commonly detected in all  three study groups. mean numbers of s. sobrinus and l. salivarius in the so group were significantly higher than in controls (p<0.05). there were no significant differences between patients and controls with respect to mean numbers of s. mutans and l. acidophilus in saliva. however, the proportions of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, and l. salivarius versus total bacteria in the so group were significantly higher than in controls. within patients, both mean numbers and the proportions of s. mutans and s. sobrinus were significantly different (p<0.05). in summary, significant differences were found in salivary ph values and the levels of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, and l. salivarius between so patients and healthy controls.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of herbal extracts on streptococcus mutans and normal oral  streptococci.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is associated with dental caries. a cariogenic biofilm, in particular, has been studied extensively for its role in the formation of dental  caries. herbal extracts such as cudrania tricuspidata, sophora flavescens, ginkgo biloba, and betula schmidtii have been used as a folk remedy for treating diseases. the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the antibacterial activity of herbal extracts against normal oral streptococci, planktonic and biofilm of s. mutans. streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguinis, and s. mutans were cultivated with brain heart infusion broth and susceptibility assay for the herbal extracts was performed according to the protocol of clinical and laboratory standard institute. also, s. mutans biofilm was formed on a polystyrene 12-well plate and  8-well chamber glass slip using bhi broth containing 2% sucrose and 1% mannose after conditioning the plate and the glass slip with unstimulated saliva. the biofilm was treated with the herbal extracts in various concentrations and inoculated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar plate for enumeration of viable s. mutans by counting colony forming units. planktonic s. mutans showed susceptibility to all of the extracts and s. mutans biofilm exhibited the highest level of sensitivity for the extracts of s. flavescens. the normal oral streptococci exhibited a weak susceptibility in comparison to s. mutans. s. oralis, however, was resistant to all of the extracts. in conclusion, the extract of s. flavescens may be a potential candidate for prevention and management of dental caries.

TI  == large-scale survey of gut microbiota associated with mhe via 16s rrna-based pyrosequencing.
AB  == objectives: elucidating the minimal hepatic encephalopathy (mhe)-associated gut microbiome may help in predicting and lowering the high risk for mhe in patients  with cirrhosis. methods: twenty-six mhe patients were recruited and screened from among those with liver cirrhosis without overt hepatic encephalopathy as defined  by abnormality seen on two test modalities: number connection test part a and the digit symbol test. using 26 mhe-matched normal relatives and 25 cirrhotic patients without mhe as controls, by means of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)-based pyrosequencing, we examined and analyzed 241,622 bacterial 16s rdna gene sequences from feces of 77 subjects. results: using multiple comparative analyses, our results found the continuous overrepresentation of two bacterial families, streptococcaceae and veillonellaceae, in cirrhotic patients with and without mhe, compared with normal individuals. in addition, we also discovered an mhe-unique interplay pattern of gut microbiota largely influenced by the members  of those two families. following these findings, we further revealed that gut urease-containing bacteria streptococcus salivarius was absent in the normal group but was present in cirrhotic patients with and without mhe. the abundance of s. salivarius was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients with mhe than in  those without (p=0.030), and the change in the amount of this bacteria was positively correlated with ammonia accumulation (r=0.58, p=0.003) in cirrhotic patients with mhe but not in those without. conclusions: gut microbiota dysbiosis may be associated with the presence of mhe in cirrhotic patients, in particular with ammonia-increasing phenotype in mhe. gut ammonia-increasing bacteria s. salivarius might be expected to be a potential biomarker of ammonia-lowering therapies in cirrhotic patients with mhe.

TI  == in vitro cpc retention and vsc adsorption by ipm oil droplets: possible mechanisms of action of a two phase mouthwash.
AB  == two phase oil-water mouthwash has been previously shown to efficiently bind oral  microorganisms, relying on their cell surface hydrophobicity. the aim of the present in vitro study was to test the cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) retention and volatile sulfide compounds (vscs) adsorption abilities of the oil droplets created by mixing of a two phase oil-water solution. vsc adsorption was assayed using a salivary incubation assay and garlic powder solutions, and demonstrated using microscopic sulfide assay. cpc retention was assayed by kinetic and endpoint measurement of streptococcus salivarius outgrowth using microplate (elisa) reader. results showed that the isopropyl myristate (ipm) oil droplets in the two phase solutions were able to adsorb 68-80% of vscs. cpc at a concentration of 0.05% was most affectively retained by the oil droplets showing  a significantly increase in residual antibacterial activity against streptococcus salivarius. these results taken together, suggests that vsc adsorption and cpc retention by ipm oil droplets may be two additional mechanisms in the activity of the two phase mouthwash formulation.

AB  == background: the tobacco plant, nicotiana tabacum, has been responsible for more deaths than any other herb. however, the literature has also been endowed with its use as "holy herb" since the pre-columbian era. used for treating pain, poisonous bites, ulcers, nasal polyps, and basal cell carcinoma; it also acts as  an important ingredient of commercially available toothpastes; and even used as tobacco vaccines against streptococcus species as highlighted in the literature.  aims and objectives: (1) to elicit the anti-microbial property of tobacco against streptococcus mutans, if any, in raw smokeless tobacco. (2) to study the relationship of duration and growth inhibition efficacy of smokeless tobacco. materials and methods: extracts were prepared by centrifugation of mixed raw smokeless tobacco with ringer's lactate solution and with saliva. the extracts were placed in wells prepared on mitis salivarius culture plate and incubated at  37 degrees c for 24 h after 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h of extract preparation. the inhibition zones were measured on the underside of plate using the vernier calipers. results: smokeless tobacco has a statistically significant zone of inhibition, which proves its anti-microbial activity against s. mutans. however,  the mean zones of inhibition were greater for ringer's lactate and tobacco group  as compared to test samples (saliva and tobacco) with subsequent reduction of inhibition zones with an increase in duration. conclusion: the anti-microbial property of extensive tobacco resources can be utilized from their extracts in order to balance the deterioration it had caused to mankind.

TI  == persistence of the oral probiotic streptococcus salivarius m18 is dose dependent  and megaplasmid transfer can augment their bacteriocin production and adhesion characteristics.
AB  == bacteriocin-producing probiotic streptococcus salivarius m18 offers beneficial modulatory capabilities within the oral microbiome, apparently through potent inhibitory activity against potentially deleterious bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes. the oral cavity persistence of s. salivarius m18 was investigated in 75 subjects receiving four different doses for 28 days. sixty per cent of the subjects already had some inhibitor-producing s. salivarius in their  saliva prior to probiotic intervention. strain m18's persistence was dependent upon the dose, but not the period of administration. culture analysis indicated that in some individuals the introduced strain had almost entirely replaced the indigenous s. salivarius, though the total numbers of the species did not increase. selected subjects showing either high or low probiotic persistence had  their salivary populations profiled using illumina sequencing of the v6 region of the 16s rrna gene. analysis indicated that while certain bacterial phenotypes were markedly modulated, the overall composition of the oral microbiome was not modified by the probiotic treatment. megaplasmids encoding bacteriocins and adhesion factors were transferred in vitro to generate a transconjugant s. salivarius exhibiting enhanced antimicrobial production and binding capabilities  to hep-2 cells. since no widespread perturbation of the existing indigenous microbiota was associated with oral instillation and given its antimicrobial activity against potentially pathogenic streptococci, it appears that application of probiotic strain m18 offers potential low impact alternative to classical antibiotic prophylaxis. for candidate probiotic strains having relatively poor antimicrobial or adhesive properties, unique derivatives displaying improved probiotic performance may be engineered in vitro by megaplasmid transfer.

TI  == rapid interferon-gamma release from natural killer cells induced by a streptococcal commensal.
AB  == interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) is a critical cytokine for the initiation of immune  responses against a variety of infectious agents and malignancies. we found that  a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria stimulated the rapid release  (<24 h) of ifn-gamma from murine leukocytes. using fluorescence activated cell sorting and cd1d(-/-) and rag1(-/-) mice, we determined that dendritic cells (dcs) and natural killer (nk) cells were primarily responsible for ifn-gamma release by streptococcus salivarius, a gram-positive commensal, previously noted  to possess potent interleukin-12 (il-12)-inducing potential. ifn-gamma release from nk cells required dc:nk membrane contact and il-12/il-18 expression, but was independent of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1-mediated interactions. ifn-gamma release in response to bacteria was maintained in mice deficient for toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 and tlr-4, suggesting that bacteria activate antigen-presenting cells via multiple, redundant pathways. together, our results  suggest that gram-positive bacteria may be useful in driving nk cell activation and t helper 1 polarization and have the potential for development as effective adjuvants.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

AB  == bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (isn), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for isn (isn solution or isn-containing creams: travogen or corticosteroid-containing travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. reactive oxygen species (ros) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. compared with ampicillin mics, isn mics for bacillus cereus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and staphylococcus hominis were lower and isn mics for corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and streptococcus salivarius were similar. incubation with isn led to a 50% kill rate for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa). post-isn incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of s. aureus cells were positive for ros. isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a mrsa strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the travocort cream. data suggest that the antibacterial effect of isn may be ros dependent. an antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.

TI  == mycobacterium tuberculosis is resistant to streptolydigin.
AB  == drug resistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) undermine tuberculosis (tb) control. streptolydigin is a broadly effective antibiotic which inhibits rna polymerase, similarly to rifampicin, a key drug in current tb chemotherapeutic regimens. due to a vastly improved chemical synthesis streptolydigin and derivatives are being promoted as putative tb drugs. the microplate alamar blue assay revealed that streptococcus salivarius and mycobacterium smegmatis were susceptible to streptolydigin with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 1.6 mg/l and 6.25 mg/l, respectively. by contrast, the mics of streptolydigin and two derivatives, streptolydiginone and dihydrostreptolydigin, against mtb were >/= 100 mg/l demonstrating that mtb is resistant to streptolydigin in contrast to previous reports. further, a porin mutant of m. smegmatis is resistant to streptolydigin indicating that porins mediate uptake of streptolydigin across the outer membrane. since the rna polymerase is a validated drug target in mtb and porins are required for susceptibility of m. smegmatis, the absence of mspa-like  porins probably contributes to the resistance of mtb to streptolydigin. this study shows that streptolydigin is not a suitable drug in tb treatment regimens.

TI  == colonization of streptococcus mutans on esthetic brackets: self-ligating vs conventional.
AB  == introduction: self-ligating orthodontic brackets rely on clips, rather than ligatures, to hold the archwire in place. it is unknown whether replacing ligatures with clips affects the adherence of streptococcus mutans. the aim of this research was to evaluate whether self-ligating brackets have an advantage over conventional brackets as determined by the adherence of s mutans. methods: the sample consisted of 50 esthetic brackets, divided into 3 experimental groups  and 2 control groups of 10 brackets each. two experimental groups were active self-ligating brackets (quicklear; forestadent, pforzheim, germany; and in-ovation c; dentsply gac, bohemia, ny); the other was a passive self-ligating bracket (damon 3; ormco, glendora, calif). the 2 control groups were conventional brackets (mystique; dentsply gac; and clarity; 3m unitek, monrovia, calif). the brackets were randomly bonded to the canines, first and second premolars, and first and second molars in the mandibular left hemiarch of 10 male participants.  biofilm was collected from the tooth surfaces before bonding and from the brackets on day 21 and placed in petri dishes containing mitis salivarius agar. the brackets were removed on day 28 and examined by using scanning electron microscopy. statistical analysis, analysis of variance, and the tukey correction  with a p value of 0.05 were used. results: the greatest numbers of colonies were  found in an active self-ligating bracket group (in-ovation c), and the fewest colonies were in a conventional bracket group (clarity). the largest colonies formed on active self-ligating brackets. in the slot, the greatest formation was  in a control group (mystique). conclusions: self-ligating esthetic brackets do not promote greater or lesser s mutans colonization when compared with conventional brackets. differences were found to be related to the material composition of the bracket.

TI  == insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (htp) family in streptococcus.
AB  == the histidine triad proteins (htps), also known as pht proteins in streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. although many studies have revealed the importance of htps in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. in this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. by further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. first, htp genes originated earlier than the streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the bovis, mutans and salivarius groups. second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp i and htp ii. although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in streptococcus  suis, htp ii members are distinct from htp i due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the c-terminus. finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. specifically, the regions outside the htp domains are under strong positive selection. this distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.

TI  == inhibitory effect on streptococcus mutans and mechanical properties of the chitosan containing composite resin.
AB  == objectives: this study evaluated the antibacterial effect and mechanical properties of composite resins (lcr, mcr, hcr) incorporating chitosan with three  different molecular weights (l, low; m, medium; h, high). materials and methods:  streptococcus (s). mutans 100 ml and each chitosan powder were inoculated in sterilized 10 ml brain-heart infusion (bhi) solution, and was centrifuged for 12  hr. absorbance of the supernatent was measured at od660 to estimate the antibacterial activities of chitosan. after s. mutans was inoculated in the disc  shaped chitosan-containing composite resins, the disc was cleansed with bhi and diluted with serial dilution method. s. mutans was spread on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar. after then, colony forming unit (cfu) was measured to verify the inhibitory effect on s. mutans biofilm. to ascertain the effect on the mechanical properties of composite resin, 3-point bending and vickers hardness tests were done after 1 and 3 wk water storage, respectively. using 2-way analysis of variance (anova) and scheffe test, statistical analysis was done with 95% significance level. results: all chitosan powder showed inhibition effect against s. mutans. cfu number in chitosan-containing composite resins was smaller than that of control resin without chitosan. the chitosan containing composite resins  did not show any significant difference in flexural strength and vickers hardness in comparison with the control resin. however, the composite resin, mcr showed a  slightly decreased flexural strength and the maximum load than those of control and the other composite resins hcr and lcr. conclusions: lcr and hcr would be recommended as a feasible antibacterial restorative due to its antibacterial nature and mechanical properties.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == organo-selenium-containing dental sealant inhibits bacterial biofilm.
AB  == oral bacteria, including streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, contribute to tooth decay and plaque formation; therefore, it is essential to develop strategies to prevent dental caries and plaque formation. we recently showed that organo-selenium compounds covalently attached to different biomaterials inhibited bacterial biofilms. our current study investigates the efficacy of an organo-selenium dental sealant (select-defense(tm) sealant) in inhibiting s. mutans and s. salivarius biofilm formation in vitro. the organo-selenium was synthesized and covalently attached to dental sealant material via standard polymer chemistry. by colony-forming unit (cfu) assay and confocal microscopy, select-defense(tm) sealant was found to completely inhibit the development of s. mutans and s. salivarius biofilms. to assess the durability of the anti-biofilm effect, we soaked the select-defense(tm) sealant in pbs for 2 mos at 37 degrees c and found that the biofilm-inhibitory effect was not diminished after soaking. to determine if organo-selenium inhibits bacterial growth under the sealant, we placed select-defense sealant over a lawn of s. mutans. in contrast to a control sealant, select-defense(tm) sealant completely inhibited the growth of s. mutans. these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of select-defense(tm) sealant against s. mutans and s. salivarius biofilms is very effective and durable.

TI  == assessment of the susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria to biocides.
AB  == biocides are antimicrobial compounds that are widely used in the food industry and medical environments. in this study, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) by the microdilution method of four different biocides for  a large collection of lab of different origins. the tested isolates belong to 11  species of the lactobacillus genus and to streptococcus thermophilus, streptococcus salivarius and lactococcus garvieae. the results obtained in this study indicate that low susceptibilities to benzalkonium chloride (bc), triclosan (tr), chlorhexidine (ch), and sodium hypochlorite (sh) are not frequent among lab. moreover, no systematic co-tolerance between two or more tested biocides was found; that is, strains displaying high mic values and thus low sensitivity to one of the biocides did not show higher mic values for the other biocides.

TI  == influence of the probiotic streptococcus salivarius strain m18 on indices of dental health in children: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == the prevalence of dental caries continues to increase, and novel strategies to reverse this trend appear necessary. the probiotic streptococcus salivarius strain m18 offers the potential to confer oral health benefits as it produces bacteriocins targeting the important cariogenic species streptococcus mutans, as  well as the enzymes dextranase and urease, which could help reduce dental plaque  accumulation and acidification, respectively. in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 100 dental caries-active children, treatment with m18 was administered for 3 months and the participants were assessed for changes to their plaque score and gingival and soft-tissue health and to their salivary levels of s. salivarius, s. mutans, lactobacilli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and candida species. at treatment end, the plaque scores were significantly (p =  0.05) lower for children in the m18-treated group, especially in subjects having  high initial plaque scores. the absence of any significant adverse events supported the safety of the probiotic treatment. cell-culture analyses of sequential saliva samples showed no differences between the probiotic and placebo groups in counts of the specifically enumerated oral micro-organisms, with the exception of the subgroup of the m18-treated children who appeared to have been colonized most effectively with m18. this subgroup exhibited reduced s. mutans counts, indicating that the anti-caries activity of m18 probiotic treatments may  be enhanced if the efficiency of colonization is increased. it was concluded that s. salivarius m18 can provide oral health benefits when taken regularly.

TI  == a defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  == the aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mm ca) in study 2. defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%smc), lesion depth (ld) and integrated mineral loss (iml) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p <  0.05). there was a decrease in %smc in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). lower iml (p < 0.001) and ld (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f. a negative correlation was found between the response variables (%smc, ld and iml) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. the results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. an effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest  fluoride concentration.

TI  == microbial contamination associated with consumption and the growth in plastic bottled beverage.
AB  == plastic bottles enable the storage of unfinished beverages, and most of microbial contamination has occurred in the unfinished beverage that was left. therefore, we investigated microorganisms in various beverages contaminated by pouring and drinking directly by mouth from the bottle, and analyzed the growth of microorganisms in the beverages at room temperature. in the pouring test, microbial growth was detected in 60 of 320 samples, and 13 bacterial strains, 49  mold strains, and 8 yeast strains were isolated. molds including cladosporium spp., tramets spp., bjerkandera spp., and penicillium spp. accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. in the drinking test, microbial growth was detected in 181 of 352 samples, and 225 bacterial strains, 27 mold strains and 77 yeast strains were isolated. bacteria including streptococcus spp. such as s. salivarius and staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. enterotoxin-producing s. aureus and bacillus cereus were also isolated. the ph of the beverage influenced the growth of bacteria. the brix values of the beverage did not correlate with the growth of microorganisms.  these results revealed that various microorganisms including foodborne pathogens  were able to grow in numerous types of beverages and that the storage of unfinished beverage in inappropriate condition, such as the storage at room temperature led microorganism to grow easily in beverage. therefore, it is necessary to consume beverages as soon as possible after opening the bottle.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == comparative study on the microbial adhesion to preveneered and stainless steel crowns.
AB  == context: the extensive plaque formation on dental restorations may contribute to  secondary caries or periodontal inflammation. therefore, it is important to know  how different types of dental restorations may prevent or promote the accumulation of microorganisms. aims: the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the adhesion of streptococcus mutans to preveneered and stainless steel  crowns (sscs) and to evaluate the effects of these restorations on the gingival health and oral hygiene. materials and methods: twenty patients (age 3-5 years) were selected from the outpatient clinic of the pedodontics department, faculty of oral and dental medicine, cairo university. the selected patients had (dmf) index for primary dentition </=4, including lower right and left first primary molars. each tooth was pulpotomy-treated and restored with either type of crowns  (split-mouth technique). then, ten swabs from the buccal mucosa, preveneered crown, and ssc surfaces were taken from each patient. also, the gingival index (gi) and oral hygiene index (ohi-s) were measured at different times during the study. mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba) was used as a selective medium for s. mutans growth. msba plates were taken in candle jar and incubated aerobically  in 37 degrees c for 48 h. finally, bacteria were counted and expressed in colony  forming unit (cfu). results: after 1, 2, and 4 weeks, mucosa and crown swabs of preveneered crown showed statistically significant higher mean cfu counts than ssc. through the whole study period, the two restorations revealed a statistically significant decrease in mean cfu counts. also, there was a statistically significant positive (direct) correlation between ohi-s, gi, and s. mutans counts on both restorations. conclusions: the adhesion of s. mutans to preveneered crowns was higher than to ssc. full mouth rehabilitation led to significant decrease in s. mutans count in the short term. an increase in s. mutans counts is associated with an increase in ohi-s and gi.

TI  == protective mechanisms of respiratory tract streptococci against streptococcus pyogenes biofilm formation and epithelial cell infection.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]) encounter many streptococcal  species of the physiological microbial biome when entering the upper respiratory  tract of humans, leading to the question how gas interact with these bacteria in  order to establish themselves at this anatomic site and initiate infection. here  we show that s. oralis and s. salivarius in direct contact assays inhibit growth  of gas in a strain-specific manner and that s. salivarius, most likely via bacteriocin secretion, also exerts this effect in transwell experiments. utilizing scanning electron microscopy documentation, we identified the tested strains as potent biofilm producers except for gas m49. in mixed-species biofilms, s. salivarius dominated the gas strains, while s. oralis acted as initial colonizer, building the bottom layer in mixed biofilms and thereby allowing even gas m49 to form substantial biofilms on top. with the exception of  s. oralis, artificial saliva reduced single-species biofilms and allowed gas to dominate in mixed biofilms, although the overall two-layer structure was unchanged. when covered by s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms, epithelial cells were protected from gas adherence, internalization, and cytotoxic effects. apparently, these species can have probiotic effects. the use of affymetrix array technology to assess hep-2 cell transcription levels revealed modest changes after exposure to s. oralis and s. salivarius biofilms which could explain some of the protective effects against gas attack. in summary, our study revealed a protection effect of respiratory tract bacteria against an important airway pathogen and allowed a first in vitro insight into local environmental processes  after gas enter the respiratory tract.

TI  == preliminary pediatric clinical evaluation of the oral probiotic streptococcus salivarius k12 in preventing recurrent pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis caused by streptococcus pyogenes and recurrent acute otitis media.
AB  == background: the oral probiotic streptococcus salivarius k12 has been shown clearly to antagonize the growth of streptococcus pyogenes, the most important bacterial cause of pharyngeal infections in humans, by releasing two bacteriocins named salivaricin a2 and salivaricin b. unpublished observations indicate that it can also antagonize the growth of other bacteria involved in acute otitis media.  because of its ability to colonize the oral cavity and its safety profile, we have tested its efficacy in reducing the incidence of streptococcal pharyngitis and/or tonsillitis and episodes of acute otitis media. methods: we enrolled 82 children, including 65 with and 17 without a recent diagnosis of recurrent oral streptococcal pathology. of those with recurrent pathology, 45 were treated daily for 90 days with an oral slow-release tablet containing five billion colony-forming units of s. salivarius k12 (bactoblis((r))), and the remaining 20  served as an untreated control group. the 17 children without a recent diagnosis  of recurrent oral pathology were used as an additional control group. after 90 days of treatment, a 6-month follow-up period without treatment was included to evaluate a possible persistent protective role for the previously administered product. results: the 41 children who completed the 90-day course of bactoblis showed a reduction in their episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infection (about 90%) and/or acute otitis media (about 40%), calculated by comparing infection rates in the previous year. the 90-day treatment also reduced the reported incidence of pharyngeal and ear infections by about 65% in the 6-month follow-up  period during which the product was not administered. subjects tolerated the product well, with no side effects or dropouts reported. conclusion: prophylactic administration of s. salivarius k12 to children with a history of recurrent oral  streptococcal pathology reduced episodes of streptococcal pharyngeal infections and/or tonsillitis as well as episodes of acute otitis media.

TI  == developing oral probiotics from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == considerable human illness can be linked to the development of oral microbiota disequilibria. the predominant oral cavity commensal, streptococcus salivarius has emerged as an important source of safe and efficacious probiotics, capable of fostering more balanced, health-associated oral microbiota. strain k12, the prototype s. salivarius probiotic, originally introduced to counter streptococcus pyogenes infections, now has an expanded repertoire of health-promoting applications. k12 and several more recently proposed s. salivarius probiotics are now being applied to control diverse bacterial consortia infections including otitis media, halitosis and dental caries. other potential applications include upregulation of immunological defenses against respiratory viral infections and treatment of oral candidosis. an overview of the key steps required for probiotic development is also presented.

TI  == comparative molecular analysis of ovine and bovine streptococcus uberis isolates.
AB  == streptococcus uberis causes clinical and subclinical mastitis in cattle and sheep, but it is unknown whether the composition of strep. uberis populations differs between host species. to address this, we characterized a collection of bovine and ovine strep. uberis isolates with shared geographical and temporal origins by means of an expanded multilocus sequence typing scheme. among 14 ovine and 35 bovine isolates, 35 allelic profiles were detected. each allelic profile was associated with a single host species and all but one were new to the multilocus sequence typing database. the median number of new alleles per isolate was higher for ovine isolates than for bovine isolates. none of the ovine isolates belonged to the global clonal complexes 5 or 143, which are commonly associated with bovine mastitis and which have a wide geographical distribution.  ovine isolates also differed from bovine isolates in carriage of plasminogen activator genes, with significantly higher prevalence of paub in ovine isolates.  isolates that were negative for yqil, one of the targets of multilocus sequence typing, were found among ovine and bovine isolates and were not associated with a specific sequence type or global clonal complex. one bovine isolate carried a gapc allele that was probably acquired through lateral gene transfer, most likely from streptococcus salivarius. we conclude that ovine isolates are distinct from  bovine isolates of strep. uberis, and that recombination between isolates from different host species or bacterial species could contribute to changes in virulence gene profiles with relevance for vaccine development.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == recovery of mutans streptococci on msb, sb-20 and sb-20m agar media.
AB  == objective: the recovery of mutans streptococci in saliva and dental biofilm samples depends, in part, on the culture medium used. in this study, we compared  (i) the culture media sucrose-bacitracin agar (sb-20), modified sb-20 (sb-20m) and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb) in the count of colony forming units (cfu) of mutans streptococci and (ii) in the morphological and biochemical differentiation between streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. design:  samples of non-stimulated saliva from 20 children were plated on sb-20, sb-20m and msb, and incubated in microaerophilia at 37 degrees c for 72h. identification of microorganisms was based on analysis of colony morphology under stereomicroscopy. the biochemical identification of colonies was done by biochemical tests using sugar fermentation, resistance to bacitracin and hydrogen peroxide production. results: there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the number of cfu of mutans streptococci recovered on sb-20 and sb-20m agar. comparing the media, sb-20 and sb-20m yielded a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies (p<0.05) and were more effective than msb in the identification of s. sobrinus (p<0.05), but not of s. mutans (p>0.05). conclusion: there was no significant difference between sb-20 and sb-20m culture  media in the count of mutans streptococci, demonstrating that the replacement of  sucrose by coarse granular cane sugar did not alter the efficacy of the medium. compared with msb, sb-20 and sb-20m allowed counting a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies and a more effective morphological identification of s. sobrinus.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of different self-etch adhesives.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial activity of different self-etch adhesives by means of the agar disc diffusion test. methods: streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus  mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of various self-etch adhesives (futurabond nr, g-aenial bond, adper easy bond self-etch adhesive, clearfil protect bond, one coat 7.0, clearfil s3 bond, clearfil se bond) using the agar disc diffusion test; 0.2% chlorexidine digluconate was used  as control. paper disks were saturated with 10 microl of each adhesive system and placed onto culture agar plates pre-adsorbed with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the growth inhibition zones around each adhesive were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. results: the test  results of the various self-etch adhesives were significantly different. conclusions: the results of the present investigation showed that the addition of mdpb monomer to an adhesive system enhances its antibacterial effect against s. salivarius, s. sanguis and s. mutans.

TI  == growth kinetics of candida biofilm on medical polymers: a long-term in vitro study.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: recent in vitro models simulating biofilm formation on medical polymers are restricted to only short-term observation periods of 2 hours to 12 days. study design: the goal of this study was to develop an in vitro model to generate a long-term polymicrobial biofilm with candida albicans (c albicans)  and streptococcus salivarius (s salivarius) on thermoplastic medical grade silicone (tps) and polyurethane (tpu) and continuous documentation of growth kinetics. methods: test platelets of tps and tpu were incubated in well plates in rpmi agar at 37 degrees c. both microbial specimen were isolated from explanted voice prostheses and added every second day for 28 days. afterward, only the nutrition solution has been changed regularly. biofilm kinetics were monitored using a specially designed image analysis software to calculate the percentual surface covering of each platelet. biofilm architecture was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (sem). microbial infiltration was examined by crystal violet staining and thin section microscopy. results: on both materials tested, a cover of living candida biofilm could be generated over 140 days. colonization was permanent with at least 10% surface coverage. initially, both materials showed coverage of up to 80% followed by biofilm detachment, which could be reduced by adding planktonic microbes. sem confirmed three-dimensional biofilm architecture with dimorphic candida growth. microbial material infiltration of nonhypheal types was proved in 2 tpu platelets, but not in tps. conclusions: the in vitro model presented in this study mimics in vivo events of  biofilm formation on medical polymers with continuous monitoring of living biofilm kinetics.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) discs.
AB  == purpose: bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. the aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (osseotite(r)) and an osseotite surface with nanometer-scale discrete crystalline deposition (dcd) of calcium phosphate (cap)(nanotite(r)). methods: surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (sem) observation. bacterial adhesion on machined, osseotite(r), and nanotite(r) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: streptococcus mutans ccug 35176, streptococcus sanguis ccug 17826, streptococcus salivarius ccug 11878, actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans ccug 37002, porphyromonas gingivalis ccug 2521. the assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: total viable count (tvc) estimation and confocal laser scanning microscopic (cslm) studies. results: the surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<nanotite(r)<osseotite(r). the attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on osseotite(r) and even higher on nanotite(r) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). the reduction  in bacterial attachment was more significant on osseotite(r) and nanotite(r) for  a. actinomycetecomitans, s. mutans and s. sanguis than for p. gingivalis and s. salivarius strains. conclusions: nanotite(r) samples showed the lowest amount of  bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher osseotite(r) surfaces.

TI  == antibacterial activity of myristica fragrans against oral pathogens.
AB  == myristica fragrans houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in penang island, malaysia. the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus mitis atcc 6249, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and three gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.25 to  640 mg/ml and 0.075 to 40 mg/ml. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing method. among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with mean mic value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml; p = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean mbc value ranging from 0.625 mg/ml to 20 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml. while for seed and mace of myristica  fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. all of the  extracts of myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against  fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586. thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == reduced salivary flow and colonization by mutans streptococci in children with down syndrome.
AB  == objectives: although individuals with down syndrome have considerable oral disease, the prevalence of dental caries in this group is low. the present study  aimed to compare known risk factors for dental caries development in children with down syndrome and a matched population (siblings). in both populations, the  number of acidogenic microorganisms, such as mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species, and the paraffin-stimulated ph, flow rate and iga concentration in whole saliva were evaluated and compared. method: saliva was collected, and the caries index was evaluated in 45 sibling pairs aged between 6  and 18 years old. the salivary iga concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetry. salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species were quantified on mitis salivarius agar containing bacitracin and 20% sucrose, rogosa agar supplemented with glacial acetic acid and sabouraud agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, respectively. results: down syndrome children  had a higher caries-free rate (p<0.05) and lower salivary mutans streptococci counts (p<0.03) compared to their siblings. similar numbers of lactobacilli and candida species were found in both groups. salivary flow rates were 36% lower in  down syndrome children compared to their siblings (p<0.05). the salivary ph did not differ between down syndrome children and controls. the down syndrome children had an iga secretion rate 29% lower than that of their siblings, but this difference was not statistically significant. conclusions: in conclusion, the lower number of mutans streptococci in the saliva may be one of the factors contributing to the lower caries rate observed in down syndrome children, despite evidence of hyposalivation.

TI  == effect of xylitol on cariogenic and beneficial oral streptococci: a randomized, double-blind crossover trial.
AB  == background/purpose: although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. the main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, streptococcus sanguinis and s. mitis. material and methods: twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis and s. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of s.  mutans levels on mitis salivarius-mutans valinomycin (ms-mutv), s. sobrinus on mitis salivarius-sobrinus (ms-sob), s. sanguinis on modified medium 10-sucrose (mm10-s) and s. mitis on mitis salivarius agar with tellurite (msat) media. results: the s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. the salivary s. sanguinis and s. mitis counts did  not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. conclusions: based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of s. sanguinis and s. mitis  in saliva. so, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.

AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == prevalence of streptococci and increased polymicrobial diversity associated with  cystic fibrosis patient stability.
AB  == diverse microbial communities chronically colonize the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. pyrosequencing of amplicons for hypervariable regions in the 16s rrna gene generated taxonomic profiles of bacterial communities for sputum genomic dna samples from 22 patients during a state of clinical stability (outpatients) and 13 patients during acute exacerbation (inpatients). we employed quantitative pcr  (qpcr) to confirm the detection of pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus by the pyrosequencing data and human oral microbe identification microarray (homim)  analysis to determine the species of the streptococci identified by pyrosequencing. we show that outpatient sputum samples have significantly higher  bacterial diversity than inpatients, but maintenance treatment with tobramycin did not impact overall diversity. contrary to the current dogma in the field that pseudomonas aeruginosa is the dominant organism in the majority of cystic fibrosis patients, pseudomonas constituted the predominant genera in only half the patient samples analyzed and reported here. the increased fractional representation of streptococcus in the outpatient cohort relative to the inpatient cohort was the strongest predictor of clinically stable lung disease. the most prevalent streptococci included species typically associated with the oral cavity (streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus parasanguis) and the streptococcus milleri group species. these species of streptococcus may play an important role in increasing the diversity of the cystic fibrosis lung environment and promoting patient stability.

TI  == a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against glucosyltransferase-b from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiological agent of dental caries in humans. s. mutans can secrete three kinds of glucosyltransferases (gtfs). one of these, gtf-b, which synthesizes water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been considered to be one of the most important factors of cariogenic dental plaque formation. therefore, determination of whether gtf-b is present in plaque and saliva samples may contribute to the evaluation of individual virulence potential (caries risk). the aim of this study was to develop a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for the routine quantification of gtf-b in plaque-derived cultures and clinical samples,  and to apply this assay to an epidemiological study. to determine the presence of gtf-b in plaque samples, a sandwich-elisa was devised, consisting of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against gtf-b and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. the developed elisa allowed for quantification of the amounts of purified gtf-b with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity; this method was not affected by other components such as plaque and  saliva. plaque samples from healthy volunteers were examined using this elisa method and microbial analysis to apply the assay to an epidemiological study. a correlation was observed between the amount of extracted gtf-b and s. mutans levels as determined by elisa and cultivated with mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates derived from plaque samples, although there were some exceptions. in  this regard, this elisa system has the advantage of estimating both the individual numbers of s. mutans and the productivity of gtf-b, namely, the cariogenic potential of s. mutans simultaneously. these results indicate that this elisa method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of caries risk.

TI  == purification and genetic characterisation of the novel bacteriocin ls2 produced by the human oral strain lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral strain with probiotic characteristics and a broad inhibitory spectrum both against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. here we present the bacteriocin ls2, an extremely ph- and heat-stable peptide with antilisterial activity. ls2 is a novel member of the class iid bacteriocins, unique among all currently characterised bacteriocins. it is somewhat similar to putative bacteriocins from several oral streptococci, including the cariogenic streptococcus mutans. ls2 is a 41-amino-acid, highly hydrophobic cationic peptide of 4115.1da that is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. ls2 was purified from cells of strain bgho1 by solvent extraction and reverse-phase chromatography. mass spectrometry was used to determine the molecular mass of the purified peptide. n-terminal amino acid sequencing enabled  identification of the ls2 structural gene bacls2 by a reverse genetics approach.  downstream of the bacls2 gene, two bacteriocin-like genes were found, named blp1a and blp1b, and one putative bacteriocin immunity gene named bimlp. we also present the identification of the 242-kb megaplasmid pmpho1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which harbours the genes bacls2, blp1a, blp1b and bimlp. two peptides with antimicrobial activity, whose approximate sizes corresponded to those of blp1a and blp1b, were identified only after culturing strain bgho1 in a  chemically defined medium. this study demonstrated the capacity of lactobacillus  salivarius bgho1 to produce multiple bacteriocins and further established this strain as a promising probiotic candidate.

TI  == [case of streptococcus salivarius bacteremia/meningoencephalitis leading to discovery of early gastric cancer].
AB  == a 73-year old man was brought to our hospital because of acute onset of fever and consciousness disturbance. he had been hemodialyzed three times a week because of chronic renal failure since 13 years ago. neurological examination revealed deteriorated consciousness and neck stiffness. a lumbar puncture yielded clouded  fluid with a wbc 7,912/mm(3) (polymorphonuclear cells 88%, mononuclear cells 12%), 786 mg/dl of protein and 4 mg/dl of glucose (blood glucose 118 mg/dl). brain ct and mri were unremarkable. he was treated with ceftriaxone and ampicillin. streptococcus salivarius was isolated from the blood sample, but not  from cerebrospinal fluid. the patient responded promptly to antibiotics therapy (ampicillin 3g/day, ceftriaxone 1g/day), and within several days he became lucid  and afebrile. isolated s. salivarius was sensitive for ampicillin and ceftriaxone. we diagnosed this case as s. salivarius bacteremia/meningoencephalitis. a gastrointestinal diagnostic workup revealed an  asymptomatic gastric adenocarcinoma. s. salivarius is a common inhabitant of the  oral mucosa that has been associated with infection in different sites. meningeal infection by s. salivarius generally related to neoplasia of colon or iatrogenia, has been described on few occasions. this is the first report of s. salivarius bacteremia/meningoencephalitis associated with gastric neoplasm. neurologist should be aware of the association of s. salivarius bacteremia/meningoencephalitis and gastrointestinal disease.

TI  == comprehensive analysis of bacterial flora in postoperative maxillary cyst fluid by 16s rrna gene and culture methods.
AB  == intracystic fluid was aseptically collected from 11 patients with postoperative maxillary cyst (pomc), and dna was extracted from the pomc fluid. bacterial species were identified by sequencing after cloning of approximately 580 bp of the 16s rrna gene. identification of pathogenic bacteria was also performed by culture methods. the phylogenetic identity was determined by sequencing 517-596 bp in each of the 1139 16s rrna gene clones. a total of 1114 clones were classified while the remaining 25 clones were unclassified. a total of 103 bacterial species belonging to 42 genera were identified in pomc fluid samples by 16s rrna gene analysis. species of prevotella (91%), neisseria (73%), fusobacterium (73%), porphyromonas (73%), and propionibacterium (73%) were found  to be highly prevalent in all patients. streptococcus mitis (64%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (55%), propionibacterium acnes (55%), staphylococcus capitis (55%), and streptococcus salivarius (55%) were detected in more than 6 of the 11 patients. the results obtained by the culture method were different from those obtained by  16s rrna gene analysis, but both approaches may be necessary for the identification of pathogens, especially of bacteria that are difficult to detect  by culture methods, and the development of rational treatments for patients with  pomc.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial comparison of chlorhexidine, persica mouthwash and miswak  extract.
AB  == aim: herbal mouthwashes, such as persica (salvadora persica, mint and yarrow extracts) and miswak extract have been shown to decrease gingival inflammation and plaque accumulation. the aim of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of persica and miswak extract with the conventional mouthwash chlorhexidine against streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus vulgaris and candida albicans. materials and methods: in this in vitro study, blood-agar culture (merk, germany) was used to grow the streptococcus strains, saburd-dextrose culture (merk, germany) was used to grow c. albicans and mrs-agar was used to grow l. vulgaris. various concentrations of  these substances (0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of miswak extract, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025 and 0.0125% of persica, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025% of chlorhexidine) were added to paper disks, separately, inserted into culture plates and transferred into the incubator. the inhibition zone around each disk was measured after 24 hours and the data was analyzed by the kruskal-wallis test. results: chlorhexidine possessed antibacterial activity at all concentrations tested. it was more effective than persica and miswak at all concentrations on s. salivarius (p = 0.022 for 0.1%, 0.009 for 0.05 and 0.025%). it had greater effect than the other  two tested material on s.sanguis only at concentration 0.01%. chlorhexidine was the most effective against s.salivarius; persica was the most effective against lactobacillus (p = 0.005) and the least effective against s. salivarius; and miswak extract was the most effective against s. salivarius and s. sanguis at concentrations 0.1 and 0.05% (p = 0.005) and ineffective against l. vulgaris. none of these mouthwashes were effective against c. albicans. conclusion: this study revealed that chlorhexidine remains the gold standard as an antimicrobial agent, although herbal based mouthwashes do have marginal antimicrobial activities. it is necessary to conduct more clinical and microbiological studies  focusing on periodontal pathogens and anaerobic microorganisms. clinical significance: mechanical plaque control is the main way for periodontal disease prevention and mouthrinses are used to improve its efficacy. based on the results of this study, chlorhexidine has the most antibacterial effect and although persica mouthwash and miswak are routinely used in some asian countries their antibacterial efficacies are suspected.

TI  == influence of orthodontic treatment on oral streptococci.
AB  == objective of this study is to evaluate the changes of the oral microbial flora, concentrating on the oral streptococci, after the first 3 and 6 months of orthodontic treatment. materials and methods: 40 patients, aged 7-17, that presented for orthodontic treatment between april and september 2010 in the department of orthodontics and dento-facial orthopedics of "carol davila" university of medicine and pharmacy, bucharest have been selected. according to the protocol, coronary and subgingival plaque was collected from the dental surface before starting any orthodontic treatment (t0), 3 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t1) and 6 months after wearing orthodontic appliances (t2). the samples were studied in cantacuzino national institute of research-development for microbiology and immunology [isolation on columbia agar  with 5% sheep blood, identification on morphotinctorial, growth and biochemical characteristics using api 20 strep (biomerieux)]. bacterial concentration (colony-forming units/sample = cfu/sample) for the aerobic and anaerobic flora was calculated by the serial dilution method of counting bacteria. results: 106 strains of oral streptococci were isolated from dental plaque, belonging to 6 species (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus acidominimus),  37 strains of oral streptococci in patients from group i (t0), 40 strains from group ii (t1) and 29 strains of oral streptococci from group iii (t2). after 3 months (t1) the aerobic bacteria percentage, detected at a concentration between  10(5) and 10(6), increased from 30 to 38.2%. the percentage of patients with a bacterial concentration higher than 10(6) cfu/sample increased from 5% to 8.8%. the samples colected at t2 (patients examined after 6 months of orthodonic treatment) presented a lower bacterial concentration, as compared to group ii (t1). the most common isolated species of streptococci were s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. mutans (37.5%, 22.5% and 10%), whose frequency increased after 3 months of treatment to 41.14%, 32.3% and respectively 14.4%, returning after 6 months of treatment at values similar to those recorded before beginning the orthodontic treatment. conclusions: presence of orthodontic appliances may produce a transitory increase of bacterial concentration (cfu/sample) and isolation rate of oral streptococci, returning to the level prior to the application of these devices after a time interval of several months.

TI  == salivaricin g32, a homolog of the prototype streptococcus pyogenes nisin-like lantibiotic sa-ff22, produced by the commensal species streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == salivaricin g32, a 2667 da novel member of the sa-ff22 cluster of lantibiotics, has been purified and characterized from streptococcus salivarius strain g32. the inhibitory peptide differs from the streptococcus pyogenes-produced sa-ff22 in the absence of lysine in position 2. the salivaricin g32 locus was widely distributed in blis-producing s. salivarius, with 6 (23%) of 26 strains pcr-positive for the structural gene, slna. as for most other lantibiotics produced by s. salivarius, the salivaricin g32 locus can be megaplasmid encoded.  another member of the sa-ff22 family was detected in two streptococcus dysgalactiae of bovine origin, an observation supportive of widespread distribution of this lantibiotic within the genus streptococcus. since the inhibitory spectrum of salivaricin g32 includes streptococcus pyogenes, its production by s. salivarius, either as a member of the normal oral microflora or  as a commercial probiotic, could serve to enhance protection of the human host against s. pyogenes infection.

TI  == in vitro functional and immunomodulatory properties of the lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5-streptococcus salivarius st3 association that are relevant to the development of a pharyngeal probiotic product.
AB  == the use of proper bacterial strains as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa is a  potential prophylactic strategy for upper respiratory tract infections. in this context, we characterized in vitro the functional and immunomodulatory properties of the strains lactobacillus helveticus mimlh5 and streptococcus salivarius st3 that were selected during previous investigations as promising pharyngeal probiotics. in this study, we demonstrated in vitro that strains mimlh5 and st3,  alone and in combination, can efficiently adhere to pharyngeal epithelial cells,  antagonize streptococcus pyogenes, and modulate host innate immunity by inducing  potentially protective effects. in particular, we found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 activate u937 human macrophages by significantly inducing the expression  of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). nonetheless, the induction of the anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (il-10) by mimlh5 or st3 was never lower than that of tnf-alpha, suggesting that these bacteria can potentially exert a regulatory rather than a proinflammatory effect. we also found that the strains mimlh5 and st3 induce cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2) expression and demonstrated that toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2) participates in the recognition of the strains mimlh5 and st3 by u937 cells. finally, we observed that these microorganisms grow efficiently when cocultured in milk, suggesting that the preparation of a milk-based fermented product containing both mimlh5 and st3 can be a practical solution for the administration of these bacteria. in conclusion, we propose the combined use of l. helveticus mimlh5 and s. salivarius st3 for the preparation of novel products that display probiotic properties for the pharyngeal mucosa.

AB  == six strains, tku 25, tku 28, tku 30, tku 31(t), tku 33 and tku 34, were isolated  from the oral cavity of a chimpanzee (pan troglodytes). colonies of strains grown on mitis-salivarius agar were similar in morphology to that of streptococcus mutans. the novel strains were gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic cocci that lacked catalase activity. analysis of the partial 16s rrna gene sequences of these isolates showed that the most closely related strain was the type strain of s. mutans (96.4 %). the next closely related strains to the isolates were the type strains of streptococcus devriesei (94.5 %) and streptococcus downei (93.9 %). these isolates could be distinguished from s. mutans by inulin fermentation and alkaline phosphatase activity (api zym system). the peptidoglycan type of the novel isolates was glu-lys-ala(3). strains were not susceptible to bacitracin. on the basis of phenotypic characterization, partial 16s rrna gene and two housekeeping gene (groel and soda) sequence data, we propose a novel taxon, streptococcus troglodytae sp. nov.; the type strain is tku 31(t) ( = jcm 18038(t) = dsm 25324(t)).

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of streptococcus salivarius k12 on bacteria involved in oral malodour.
AB  == objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of the bacteriocin-producing strain streptococcus salivarius k12 against several bacteria involved in halitosis. design: the inhibitory activity of s. salivarius k12 against solobacterium moorei ccug39336, four clinical s. moorei isolates, atopobium parvulum atcc33793 and eubacterium sulci atcc35585 was examined by a deferred antagonism test. eubacterium saburreum atcc33271 and parvimonas micra atcc33270,  which have been tested in previous studies, served as positive controls, and the  gram-negative strain bacteroides fragilis zib2800 served as a negative control. additionally, the occurrence of resistance in s. moorei ccug39336 to s. salivarius k12 was analysed by either direct plating or by passage of s. moorei ccug39336 on chloroform-inactived s. salivarius k12-containing agar plates. results: s. salivarius k12 suppressed the growth of all gram-positive bacteria tested, but the extent to which the bacteria were inhibited varied. e. sulci atcc35585 was the most sensitive strain, while all five s. moorei isolates were inhibited to a lesser extent. natural resistance seems to be very low in s. moorei ccug39336, and there was only a slight decrease in sensitivity after exposure to s. salivarius k12 over 10 passages. conclusion: our studies demonstrate that s. salivarius k12 has antimicrobial activity against bacteria involved in halitosis. this strain might be an interesting and valuable candidate for the development of an antimicrobial therapy for halitosis.

TI  == outbreak of bacterial meningitis among patients undergoing myelography at an outpatient radiology clinic.
AB  == purpose: to investigate an outbreak of bacterial meningitis at an outpatient radiology clinic (clinic a) and to determine the source and implement measures to prevent additional infections. methods: a case was defined as bacterial meningitis in a patient undergoing myelography at clinic a from october 11 to 25, 2010. patients who underwent myelography and other procedures at clinic a during  that period were interviewed, medical records were reviewed, and infection prevention practices were assessed. case-patient cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimens, oral specimens from health care personnel (hcp), and opened iohexol vials were tested for bacteria. bacterial isolates were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. a culture-negative csf specimen was tested using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. results: three cases were identified among 35 clinic a patients who underwent procedures from october 11 to 25, 2010. all case-patients required hospitalization, 2 in an intensive care unit. case-patients had myelography performed by the same radiology physician assistant and technician on october 25; all patients who underwent myelography on october 25 were affected. hcp did not wear facemasks and reused single-dose iohexol vials for multiple patients. streptococcus salivarius (a bacteria commonly found in oral flora) was detected in the csf of 2 case-patients (1 by culture, 1 using real-time polymerase chain reaction) and in hcp oral specimens;  1 opened iohexol vial contained staphylococcus epidermidis. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles from the case-patient s salivarius and the radiology physician assistant were indistinguishable. conclusions: bacterial meningitis likely occurred because hcp performing myelography did not wear facemasks; lapses in injection practices may have contributed to transmission. targeted education regarding mask use and safe injection practices is needed among radiology hcp.

AB  == we recently investigated three cases of bacterial meningitis that were reported from a midwestern radiology clinic where facemasks were not worn during spinal injection of contrast agent during myelography procedures. using pulsed field gel electrophoresis we linked a case strain of s. salivarius to an oral specimen of a radiology physician assistant (rpa). we also used a real-time pcr assay to detect s. salivarius dna within a culture-negative cerebrospinal fluid (csf) specimen. here we extend this investigation through using a nested pcr/sequencing strategy  to link the culture-negative csf specimen to the case strain. we also provide validation of the real-time pcr assay used, demonstrating that it is not solely specific for streptococcus salivarius, but is also highly sensitive for detection of the closely related oral species streptococcus vestibularis. through using multilocus sequence typing and 16s rdna sequencing we further strengthen the link between the csf case isolate and the rpa carriage isolate. we also demonstrate that the newly characterized strains from this study are distinct from previously characterized s. salivarius strains associated with carriage and meningitis.

TI  == development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  == introduction: the development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize  the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. methods: four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ  hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. the live/dead baclight technique (molecular probes, carlsbad, ca) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. results: the 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. the biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. a high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. the community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did  not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which e. faecalis, l. salivarius, and s. gordonii were most abundant. conclusions: the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study  give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. this multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on the mechanical behavior of titanium dental implants.
AB  == purpose: this study sought to determine whether the mechanical properties of titanium dental implants changed after exposure to bacteria. materials and methods: two strains of bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis and lactobacillus salivarius) were used in the study. the adhesive properties of the two strains were investigated as follows. titanium implants were placed in bacteria broth, seeded with the two bacteria strains, and left in the broth for 1 or 3 months. another group of titanium implants was immersed in artificial saliva at 37 degrees c for 3 months. ten implants in each group were tested in 37 degrees c artificial saliva to evaluate their mechanical flexural strength and fatigue life. results: the bacterial cultures grew quickly on titanium surfaces. after 1  month of bacteria culture in vitro, the bacteria had produced corrosion pits on the titanium surfaces. after 3 months of bacterial culture, a 7% decrease in the  flexural strength of the implant samples and a decrease of 15% in the number of cycles to failure by fatigue were seen versus implants not exposed to bacteria. conclusions: these results demonstrate that, in physiologic conditions in vitro,  bacteria have the capacity to produce a pitting corrosion phenomenon on exposed titanium surfaces, leading to a significant deterioration in the mechanical properties of the implant. it is therefore logical to conclude that bacteria may  produce corrosion that reduces the useful life of dental implants.

AB  == oral candidiasis is often accompanied by severe inflammation, resulting in a decline in the quality of life of immunosuppressed individuals and elderly people. to develop a new oral therapeutic option for candidiasis, a nonpathogenic commensal oral probiotic microorganism, streptococcus salivarius k12, was evaluated for its ability to modulate candida albicans growth in vitro, and its therapeutic activity in an experimental oral candidiasis model was tested. in vitro inhibition of mycelial growth of c. albicans was determined by plate assay  and fluorescence microscopy. addition of s. salivarius k12 to modified rpmi 1640  culture medium inhibited the adherence of c. albicans to the plastic petri dish in a dose-dependent manner. preculture of s. salivarius k12 potentiated its inhibitory activity for adherence of c. albicans. interestingly, s. salivarius k12 was not directly fungicidal but appeared to inhibit candida adhesion to the substratum by preferentially binding to hyphae rather than yeast. to determine the potentially anti-infective attributes of s. salivarius k12 in oral candidiasis, the probiotic was administered to mice with orally induced candidiasis. oral treatment with s. salivarius k12 significantly protected the mice from severe candidiasis. these findings suggest that s. salivarius k12 may inhibit the process of invasion of c. albicans into mucous surfaces or its adhesion to denture acrylic resins by mechanisms not associated with the antimicrobial activity of the bacteriocin. s. salivarius k12 may be useful as a probiotic as a protective tool for oral care, especially with regard to candidiasis.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing oral streptococci and inhibition of respiratory pathogens.
AB  == the use of bacteria as probiotics is in continuous development, thanks to their capacity to maintain or restore a host's natural microbiome by interference with  and/or inhibition of other microorganisms mediated by antimicrobial peptide production such as bacteriocins. in the oral cavity, streptococcus salivarius, a  non-pathogenic and predominant oral species, is one of the major bacteriocin producers that is able to coexist in this environment and reduce the frequency of colonization of the main pathogens involved in upper respiratory tract infections. the aim of this study was to screen oral bacteria colonizing healthy  children for their use as potential oral probiotics. eighty-one alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from nasal and/or pharyngeal swabs of 31 healthy children aged between two and twelve years were isolated. among them, 13 alpha-hemolytic streptococci were selected for their bacteriocin-like inhibitory activity against potential pathogens. these strains were tested for bacteriocin production and assayed for their capacity to adhere to hep-2 cell lines. our data showed that 13 bacteriocin producer strains were able to inhibit different gram-positive pathogens. among them one strain, s. salivarius 24smb, deposited as dsm 23307, was selected as a potential oral probiotic, thanks to its safety assessment, ability to inhibit streptococcus pneumoniae and the absence of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes.

TI  == culture-negative endocarditis diagnosed using 16s dna polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == 16s dna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a molecular amplification technique that can be used to identify bacterial pathogens in culture-negative endocarditis. bacterial dna can be isolated from surgically excised valve tissue  or from blood collected in edta vials. use of this technique is particularly helpful in identifying the bacterial pathogen in cases of culture-negative endocarditis. a case involving a 48-year-old man who presented with severe aortic regurgitation and a four-month prodrome of low-grade fever is reported. blood and valve tissue cultures following valve replacement were negative. a valve tissue sample was sent for investigation with 16s dna pcr, which successfully identified streptococcus salivarius and was interpreted as the true diagnosis. a review of the literature suggests that 16s dna pcr from valve tissue is a more sensitive diagnostic test than culture. it is also extremely specific, based on a sequence  match of at least 500 base pairs.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of galls of quercus infectoria olivier against oral pathogens.
AB  == the galls of quercus infectoria are commonly used in malay traditional medicine to treat wound infections after childbirth. in india, they are employed traditionally as dental applications such as that in treatment of toothache and gingivitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of galls of quercus infectoria olivier against oral bacteria which are known to cause dental caries and periodontitis. methanol and acetone extracts were screened against two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and two gram-negative bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). the screening test of antibacterial activity was performed using agar-well diffusion  method. subsequently, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by using twofold serial microdilution method at a concentration ranging between 0.01 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing microtiter wells which showed no changes in colour of the indicator  after incubation. both extracts showed inhibition zones which did not differ significantly (p < 0.05) against each tested bacteria. among all tested bacteria, s. salivarius was the most susceptible. the mic ranges for methanol and acetone extracts were the same, between 0.16 and 0.63 mg/ml. the mbc value, for methanol  and acetone extracts, was in the ranges 0.31-1.25 mg/ml and 0.31-2.50 mg/ml, respectively. both extracts of q. infectoria galls exhibited similar antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. thus, the galls may be considered  as effective phytotherapeutic agents for the prevention of oral pathogens.

TI  == salivaricin d, a novel intrinsically trypsin-resistant lantibiotic from streptococcus salivarius 5m6c isolated from a healthy infant.
AB  == in this work, we purified and characterized a newly identified lantibiotic (salivaricin d) from streptococcus salivarius 5m6c. salivaricin d is a 34-amino-acid-residue peptide (3,467.55 da); the locus of the gene encoding this  peptide is a 16.5-kb dna segment which contains genes encoding the precursor of two lantibiotics, two modification enzymes (dehydratase and cyclase), an abc transporter, a serine-like protease, immunity proteins (lipoprotein and abc transporters), a response regulator, and a sensor histidine kinase. the immunity  gene (sali) was heterologously expressed in a sensitive indicator and provided significant protection against salivaricin d, confirming its immunity function. salivaricin d is a naturally trypsin-resistant lantibiotic that is similar to nisin-like lantibiotics. it is a relatively broad-spectrum bacteriocin that inhibits members of many genera of gram-positive bacteria, including the important human pathogens streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. thus, streptococcus salivarius 5m6c may be a potential biological agent for the control of oronasopharynx-colonizing streptococcal pathogens or may be used as a  probiotic bacterium.

TI  == streptococci-human papilloma virus interaction with ethanol exposure leads to keratinocyte damage.
AB  == purpose: ethanol, human papilloma virus (hpv), and poor oral hygiene are risk factors that have been attributed to oral carcinogenesis. streptococci sp and hpv infections are common in the head and neck, often associated with sexual activity. although hpv is linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, it is  unclear whether there is a similar role for streptococci sp. this cell study examines whether streptococci sp and hpv-16 with exposure to ethyl alcohol (etoh) can act as cofactors in the malignant transformation of oral keratinocytes. materials and methods: etoh (0.1%-20% vol/vol) was used to investigate streptococci sp attachment with immortalized e6-expressing hpv/hok-16b cells, human oral buccal keratinocytes, and foreskin keratinocytes. streptococci sp (streptococci mutans [lt11]) and various strains of acetaldehyde (aa) producer and nonproducer streptococcus salivarius (110-1, 109-2, 101-7, and 107-1) and a lactic acid producer bacterium, lactobacillus rhamnosus (24-1 and 25-2), were examined for interactions with keratinocytes by use of a green dye (percent of cells with colonies after 24 hours). carcinogens, aa, malondialdehyde, dna damage, and proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) among keratinocytes were also quantified. results: aa and malondialdehyde production from permissible streptococci sp significantly increased with attachment to keratinocytes, whereas l rhamnosus did not significantly attach to keratinocytes. this attachment was associated with enhanced levels of aa adduct formation, proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation), and enhanced migration through integrin-coated basement membrane by hpv oral keratinocytes, which are characteristics of a malignant phenotype. conclusions: these cell studies suggest that oral streptococci sp and hpv (hpv-16) cooperate to transform oral keratinocytes after low-level etoh (1%) exposure. these results appear to suggest a significant clinical interaction, but further validation is warranted.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

AB  == objective: to investigate three tropical plant materials - clove seeds [syzygium  aromaticum (s. aromaticum)], bitter kola fruits [garcinia kola (g. kola)] and tobacco leaves (nicotiana species) as potential targeted killers of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), a cavity-causing bacterium (gram-positive, facultative anaerobe) that resides in a multispecies microbial community (dental plaque) for  the treatment of dental caries (tooth decay). methods: thirty one (31) teeth samples were collected from patients with obvious signs of tooth decay (swollen gum, weak or fallen tooth, etc.) using sterile swab sticks. these samples were collected from two major dental clinics in nsukka, enugu state, nigeria and investigated by spread inoculation onto sterile blood agar and mueller hinton agar (mha) respectively and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the discrete colonies obtained were further re-inoculated onto sterile mitis salivarius agar (msa) plates and incubated as above. the isolates were characterized by gram staining and catalase test. tobacco leaves, clove seeds and bitter kola fruits were ground into powder, extracted with three different solvents (n-hexane, hot water and ethanol), filtered, dried and stored in clean containers, corked and kept until used. the plant extracts were investigated for phytochemistry, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum cidal concentration (mcc) and compared with some conventional antibiotics commonly used against tooth decay. antibiotic  sensitivity test was also carried out. the results were statistically analyzed. results: the extracts showed varied phytochemical composition but most abundantly the flavonoids. our result also shows that females (16) have more tooth decay than males (15) and that 16 samples were very bloody while 15 were slightly bloody. the microbial characterization showed that 18 samples were catalase-positive indicating the presence of s. mutans while 13 were catalase-negative suspected to be staphylococcus spp. the gram reaction confirmed 13 gram-negative and 18 gram-positive organisms. the n-hexane extract had the best antimicrobial activity followed by the ethanol and lastly hot water. mic showed that n-hexane clove extract had the largest inhibition zone diameter, followed by bitter kola extract and lastly tobacco extract. the antibiotic sensitivity test credited ciprofloxacin the best because it exhibited broad spectrum of action. conclusions: since the n-hexane extract of clove seeds demonstrated preferential growth-inhibitory activity against the causal cariogenic pathogens (s. mutans) in dental caries, we therefore, report here that clove extract be henceforth considered as a potential ingredient in toothpaste preparation.

TI  == production of multiple bacteriocins from a single locus by gastrointestinal strains of lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius isolates derived from a gastrointestinal origin have previously demonstrated efficacy for in vivo protection against listeria monocytogenes infection. in this study, comparative genomic analysis was employed to investigate the intraspecies diversity of seven  l. salivarius isolates of human and porcine intestinal origin, based on the genome of the well-characterized bacteriocin-producing strain l. salivarius ucc118. this revealed a highly conserved megaplasmid-borne gene cluster in these  strains involved in the regulation and secretion of two-component class iib bacteriocins. however, considerable intraspecific variation was observed in the structural genes encoding the bacteriocin peptides. they ranged from close relatives of abp118, such as salivaricin p, which differs by 2 amino acids, to completely novel bacteriocins, such as salivaricin t, which is characterized in this study. salivaricin t inhibits closely related lactobacilli and bears little  homology to previously characterized salivaricins. interestingly, the two peptides responsible for salivaricin t activity, saltalpha and saltbeta, share considerable identity with the component peptides of thermophilin 13, a bacteriocin produced by streptococcus thermophilus. furthermore, the salivaricin  locus of strain dpc6488 also encodes an additional novel one-component class iid  anti-listerial bacteriocin, salivaricin l. these findings suggest a high level of redundancy in the bacteriocins that can be produced by intestinal l. salivarius isolates using the same enzymatic production and export machinery. such diversity may contribute to their ability to dominate and compete within the complex microbiota of the mammalian gut.

TI  == discovery of a linear cyclotide from the bracelet subfamily and its disulfide mapping by top-down mass spectrometry.
AB  == cyclotides are heat-stable macrocyclic peptides from plants that display a wide range of biological activities. they can be divided into two subfamilies: mobius  or bracelet, based on the presence or absence of a cis-proline residue in loop 5, respectively. currently, over 150 cyclotides have been discovered, but only four  linear variants of the mobius subfamily have been hitherto isolated. in this study, we report the discovery of two novel cyclotides, hedyotide b1 and hedyotide b2, from the aerial parts of hedyotis biflora. hedyotide b1 has a cyclic cystine knot structure typical of cyclotides. interestingly, hedyotide b2  possesses a linear backbone and is the first linear representative of the bracelet subfamily. disulfide mapping of hedyotide b2 by a top-down ms/ms approach showed that it shares the same knotted disulfide arrangement as conventional cyclotides. its unfolding pathway also showed that the penetrating disulfide bond cys iii-vi is the most stable disulfide linkage. cloning of the gene encoding hedyotide b2 revealed a nonsense mutation that introduces a premature stop codon at the conserved asn residue position, which is essential for an end-to-end backbone ligation. biophysical characterization showed that hedyotide b2 was more susceptible to exopeptidase degradation as compared with hedyotide b1. hedyotide b2 was also inactive against all four tested bacterial strains, whereas hedyotide b1 was bactericidal to escherichia coli and streptococcus salivarius at low micromolar concentration. our results provide a deeper understanding of the structures, functions, and biosynthetic processing of cyclotides and uncyclotides in plants.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr)  of the parc gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  == forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (vgs) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). in addition, the parc gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. overall, 44 vgs organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. reduced mics were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the mic in the case of streptococcus mitis, s. oralis and s. salivarius, as well as to increase the mic by two doubling dilutions in two of the three s. parasanguinis isolates. amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of the parc gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with s. pneumoniae r6 and eight (s52, f55, s58, n91, e135, k137, f141 and s167) were common in the vgs species examined. in addition, minor  substitutions were found at three positions (d51, t54 and v86). in conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of vgs isolated from the community. in addition, several silent mutations were noted in vgs organisms without any increase in mic against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == establishment of streptococcus mutans in infants induces decrease in the proportion of salivary alpha-haemolytic bacteria.
AB  == objective: for paediatric dentists, an indicator to assess caries risk of infants is very important. conventionally, the number and/or proportions of streptococcus mutans have been employed as risk indicator; however, because such figures reflect the existing situation, they are not suitable for assessing caries risk of infants that have not yet been infected with s. mutans. thus, we searched for  an indicator for the establishment of s. mutans. methods: to evaluate the changes caused by the establishment of s. mutans in the microbiota of the infant oral cavity, we monitored changes in the oral microbiota of two pre-dentate infants over a 3-year period and in a cross-sectional study of 40 nursery school-aged children by cultivation of saliva on nonselective blood agar, mitis-salivarius agar, and mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with bacitracin combined with identification of selected isolates. results: two longitudinal observations suggested that the establishment of s. mutans would induce a decrease in alpha-haemolytic bacteria in the microbial population of the oral cavity. this suggestion was compensated with the results of cross-sectional study, and it was  revealed that the establishment of 10(3) cfu/ml of mutans streptococci in saliva  might be predicted by a microbiota comprising less than approximately 55% of alpha-haemolytic. conclusion: decrease in the proportion of alpha-haemolytic bacteria in saliva of infant was found to be applicable as an indicator to predict the establishment of s. mutans and to assess dental caries risk as a background for planning of dental care and treatment in the infants before infection with s. mutans.

TI  == salivary enzymes and exhaled air affect streptococcus salivarius growth and physiological state in complemented artificial saliva.
AB  == to better understand the phenomena governing the establishment of the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius in the mouth, the effect of some environmental factors has been studied in complemented artificial saliva, under oral ph and temperature conditions. three salivary enzymes at physiological concentrations were tested: peroxidase, lysozyme and amylase, as well as injection of exhaled air. injection of air containing 5% co2 and 16% o2 induced a deleterious effect on s. salivarius k12, mainly by increasing redox potential. addition of lysozyme  slightly affected the physiological state of s. salivarius by altering membrane integrity. in contrast, peroxidase was not detrimental as it made it possible to  decrease the redox potential. the addition of amylase reduced the specific growth rate of s. salivarius by formation of a complex with amylase and mucins, but led  to high final biomass, as a result of enzymatic degradation of some nutrients. finally, this work demonstrated that salivary enzymes had a slight impact on s. salivarius behaviour. it can thus be concluded that this bacterium was well adapted to in-mouth conditions, as it was able to resist certain salivary enzymes, even if tolerance to expired air was affected, as a result of an increased redox potential.

AB  == objectives: previous reports have associated salivary beta-galactosidase activity with non-periodontopathic oral malodour. in this study, we investigated the localization of beta-galactosidase and elucidated the relationship between its enzymatic activity and physiological oral malodour. study design: fifty-six patients complaining of halitosis were separated into two groups: periodontally healthy and periodontitis. saliva samples from the subjects were separated by centrifugation, and the level of beta-galactosidase activity was measured in the  supernatant, pellet lysate, and whole saliva using the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside. the correlation of salivary beta-galactosidase activity with breath odour and associated parameters was examined. results: similar levels of beta-galactosidase activity were detected in the pellet lysate and whole saliva, but not in the saliva supernatant. positive correlations were observed between the beta-galactosidase activity in whole saliva and oral malodour levels in the periodontally healthy group, but not in the periodontitis group. in addition, the plaque index and tongue coating score were positively correlated with beta-galactosidase activity in the periodontally  healthy group. overall, stimulated salivary flow and salivary ph were negatively  correlated with enzyme activity. the amounts of total bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus salivarius were positively associated with beta-galactosidase activity in the periodontally healthy group. furthermore, the  amounts of total bacteria and s. salivarius were positively associated with the amount of volatile sulphur compounds. conclusions: our results indicate that beta-galactosidase is located on the cell surface of oral bacteria derived from dental plaque and tongue coating, and it plays an important role in producing the malodour underlying physiological oral malodour.

TI  == beneficial microbes for the oral cavity: time to harness the oral streptococci?
AB  == indigenous microbes are known to influence human health outcomes and various approaches are now being made to positively modulate these microbe-induced outcomes via the administration of probiotics. the application of probiotics that are specific to the oral cavity is a relatively undeveloped field, and their emergence has largely occurred as a reasoned follow-up to initial studies in which probiotics that had already been developed and obtained regulatory approval for intestinal applications were then also evaluated for their putative influence on oral microbiota functionality. these attempts to extend the application of existing probiotics were probably at least in part motivated by recognition of the substantial safety and regulatory hurdles that must be overcome prior to the  introduction of a novel probiotic agent. nevertheless, from an efficacy perspective it appears more logical to develop microbes of oral origin as the specific providers of probiotic solutions for oral diseases, rather than attempting to adapt intestinally-derived strains for this role. oral bacteria and their bioactive molecules have evolved to operate optimally in this environment and in some cases are known to persist only in oral sites. amongst the bacteria of more than 700 species now identified within the human oral microbiota, it is the streptococci that are numerically predominant. although this review highlights the development of the oral cavity bacterium streptococcus salivarius  as an oral probiotic, a number of other streptococcal species have also been shown to have considerable potential as probiotic candidates.

TI  == clinical and laboratory features of streptococcus salivarius meningitis: a case report and literature review.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a normal member of the human oral microbiome that is  an uncommon cause of invasive infections. meningitis is a rare but increasingly reported infection caused by s. salivarius. despite the growing number of reported cases, a comprehensive review of the literature on s. salivarius meningitis is lacking. we sought to gain a better understanding of the clinical presentation, evaluation, management, and outcome of s. salivarius meningitis by  analyzing previously reported cases. in addition to a single case reported here,  64 previously published cases of meningitis were identified for this review. the  collected data confirm that most patients presented with classical signs and symptoms of bacterial meningitis with a predominance of neutrophils in the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) and hypoglycorrhachia. the majority of cases followed iatrogenic or traumatic csf contamination. most cases were diagnosed by csf culture within one day of symptom onset. there was no clear evidence of predisposing co-morbid conditions in patients with meningitis, although in most case reports, limited information was given on the medical history of each patient. outcomes were generally favorable with antibiotic management. clinicians should suspect s. salivarius meningitis in patients presenting acutely after medical or surgical procedures involving the meninges.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci counts in  indian children.
AB  == aim: probiotics and their effect on oral health have been a focus of numerous trials in recent times. no documented trials have been reported from developing countries such as india with its focus on probiotic use, especially in the paediatric population. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci (ms) counts of children using the two  commercially and widely available preparations and to explore their anti-caries potential. study design: a placebo controlled study was undertaken with 3 parallel arms comprising a total of 150 healthy children (7-14 years). the subjects were randomly divided into the groups (each comprising 50 children): group a - placebo powder, group b - a freeze dried powdered combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium species, group c - a freeze dried powdered preparation of bacillus coagulans. the subjects were instructed to mix the preparation in 20 ml of water and to follow a swish and swallow method for 14 days. mutans streptococci colony counts per ml of saliva were performed on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar collected on the first day and 14 days post-intervention. results: a statistically significant reduction (p<0.001) in salivary mutans streptococci counts was recorded in both groups b and c after 14  days of probiotic ingestion. conclusion: a cost-effective probiotic such as bacillus coagulans might be a subject for further research for prevention of caries in children.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == [the antagonistic effect of the oral streptococcus on the saccharomyces albicans  in vitro].
AB  == objective: to investigate the antagonistic effects of three species of oral streptococcus on the growth of oral saccharomyces albicans in vitro. methods: direct inoculation method, reverse inoculation method and mixed culture methods were respectively chosen to observe the changes of saccharomyces albicans colony  formation on the effects of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius. results: 1) no clear inhibition zone was observed in each of the groups by direct inoculation method. 2) compared with the control groups, saccharomyces albicans colony formation on soft agar of streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly (p < 0.05). 3) mixed culture method results showed that streptococcus mutans could inhibit the growth of saccharomyces albicans significantly at different time points (p = 0.001). 4) under the action  of bacteria culture supernatant, the count of saccharomyces albicans in experiment groups showed statistical significance when compared with the control  groups at 24, 48, 72 h (p = 0.001); the differences among the experimental groups were of no statistical significance at majority times (p > 0.05). conclusion: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus salivarius could obviously inhibit the growth of saccharomyces albicans in vitro. however, it is still unclear that among which the inhibition effects is stronger. the antagonistic effects is weakened gradually.

TI  == in situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  == many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. however, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. as a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16s ribosomal rna fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation  by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: streptococcus sanguinis,  actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus salivarius. surfaces blasted with al(2)  o(3) (s(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (s(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (s(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned  surfaces. hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. after 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii only). the biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.

TI  == b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors of oral squamous carcinoma cells are upregulated by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the up-regulation of the b7-h1 receptors in host cells might influence the chronicity of inflammatory disorders that frequently precede the development of human cancers. b7-h1 expression has been detected in the majority of human cancers, leading to anergy and apoptosis of activated t cells, and enabling tumor cells to overcome host response. porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis), a putative periodontal pathogen, is an etiologic agent of periodontitis and expresses a variety of virulence factors. in this study, the expression of b7-h1  and b7-dc receptors on squamous cell carcinoma cells scc-25 and bhy and primary human gingival keratinocytes (phgk) was analyzed after infection with two virulent p. gingivalis strains in vitro. after 48h, the cells were stained with antibodies for human b7-h1 and b7-dc and further analyzed by flow cytometry. rna  was extracted and gene expression of b7-h1 or b7-dc was quantified by real time pcr. after infection with p. gingivalis, both b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors were up-regulated. the mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) increased from 4.5 to 9.9 (b7-h1) and from 6.9 to 15.0 (b7-dc) (p<0.05, respectively) in scc-25 cells. phgk showed an increase from 4.8 to 12.4 (b7-h1) and from 5.5 to 15.6 (b7-dc) (p<0.05, respectively). streptococcus salivarius k12, a commensal bacterium, caused no up-regulation. after 24h, the expression of b7h1 and b7-dc mrna in infected cells, normalized to gapdh and in relation to non-infected cells, was 6.4 fold (b7-h1) and 8.6 fold (b7-dc) higher. in phgk b7-h1/dc mrna expression increased 8.2 fold (b7-h1) and 5.9 fold (b7dc) (p<0.05) respectively. the results of the study demonstrate that in contrast to s. salivarius k12 virulent p. gingivalis strains are able to induce the expression of the b7-h1 and b7-dc receptors in squamous carcinoma cells and human gingival keratinocytes, which might facilitate immune evasion by oral cancers.

AB  == inhibition of bacterial transcription represents an effective and clinically validated anti-infective chemotherapeutic strategy. we describe the evolution of  our approach to the streptolydigin class of antibiotics that target bacterial rna polymerases (rnaps). this effort resulted in the synthesis and biological evaluation of streptolydigin, streptolydiginone, streptolic acid, and a series of new streptolydigin-based agents. subsequent biochemical evaluation of rnap inhibition demonstrated that the presence of both streptolic acid and tetramic acid subunits was required for activity of this class of antibiotics. in addition, we identified 10,11-dihydrostreptolydigin as a new rnap-targeting agent, which was assembled with high synthetic efficiency of 15 steps in the longest linear sequence. dihydrostreptolydigin inhibited three representative bacterial rnaps and displayed in vitro antibacterial activity against s. salivarius . the overall increase in synthetic efficiency combined with substantial antibacterial activity of this fully synthetic antibiotic demonstrates the power of organic synthesis in enabling design and comprehensive  in vitro pharmacological evaluation of new chemical agents that target bacterial  transcription.

TI  == characterization of streptococcus salivarius growth and maintenance in artificial saliva.
AB  == aims: to help gain a better understanding of factors influencing the establishment within the oral cavity of streptococcus salivarius k12, a commensal oral bacterium, we characterized its behaviour in artificial saliva. methods and  results: streptococcus salivarius k12 was grown in artificial saliva complemented with a representative meal, under oral ph and temperature conditions. exponential growth phase was characterized by a high specific growth rate (2.8 h(-1)). during maintenance phase, an uncoupling between growth and lactic acid production occurred, which allowed maintaining viability (95%), intracellular ph (6.6) and membrane polarisation (95%), and thus proton motive force. however, in late stationary phase, viability (64%) and vitality were degraded as a result of lower synthesis of energetic and glycogen-related proteins as compared to a richer medium. conclusions: streptococcus salivarius was able to rapidly grow in complemented artificial saliva. nevertheless, a degradation of its physiological  state was observed in late-stationary phase. significance and impact of the study: this work demonstrates, for the first time, that artificial saliva was a convenient medium that permitted strep. salivarius to grow in oral conditions (physico-chemical environment, addition of meals) but not to maintain cellular viability and vitality in starvation conditions.

AB  == paranasal sinusitis is a condition that is treated by a general practitioner and  in case it fails it requires specialistic therapy. in most cases the inflammation is connected with nasal mucosa infection. however, in older children and adolescents sinusitis caused by spreading of tooth and gingiva inflammatory process can be an essential therapeutic and diagnostic problem. it is most often  connected with periapical lesions, complications following dental procedures and  oroantral fistula inflammation. inflammatory process originally concerns maxillary sinus, however, it often undergoes generalization and it affects all or most of sinuses unilaterally or bilaterally. in microbiology of odontogenic sinusitis the dominant bacteria are the bacteria typical for peridental lesions (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and anaerobic bacteria). odontogenic sinusitis frequently causes life threatening complications that require heroic drug and surgical treatment. therapeutic and diagnostic problems are presented in case studies of 5 children aged from 10 to 17, who are treated in children's otolaryngology, audiology and phoniatrics clinic in lodz. there seems to be the need to emphasize the importance of thorough examination of oral cavity in all the children suffering from sinusitis, especially unilateral sinusitis. it is so essential on account of the gravity of  the problem and serious complications that accompany the conditions.

TI  == comparative genomics and the role of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of bovine adapted streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == in addition to causing severe invasive infections in humans, streptococcus agalactiae, or group b streptococcus (gbs), is also a major cause of bovine mastitis. here we provide the first genome sequence for s. agalactiae isolated from a cow diagnosed with clinical mastitis (strain fsl s3-026). comparison to eight s. agalactiae genomes obtained from human disease isolates revealed 183 genes specific to the bovine strain. subsequent polymerase chain reaction (pcr) screening for the presence/absence of a subset of these loci in additional bovine and human strains revealed strong differentiation between the two groups (fisher  exact test: p<0.0001). the majority of the bovine strain-specific genes ( approximately 85%) clustered tightly into eight genomic islands, suggesting these genes were acquired through lateral gene transfer (lgt). this bovine gbs also contained an unusually high proportion of insertion sequences (4.3% of the total  genome), suggesting frequent genomic rearrangement. comparison to other mastitis-causing species of bacteria provided strong evidence for two cases of interspecies lgt within the shared bovine environment: bovine s. agalactiae with  streptococcus uberis (nisin u operon) and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (lactose operon). we also found evidence for lgt, involving the salivaricin operon, between the bovine s. agalactiae strain and either streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus salivarius. our findings provide insight  into mechanisms facilitating environmental adaptation and acquisition of potential virulence factors, while highlighting both the key role lgt has played  in the recent evolution of the bovine s. agalactiae strain, and the importance of lgt among pathogens within a shared environment.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

AB  == we used a cultivation-independent, clone library-based 16s rrna gene sequence analysis to identify bacterial communities present during traditional fermentation in sour cassava starch, cachaca and cheese production in brazil. partial 16s rrna gene clone sequences from sour cassava starch samples collected  on day five of the fermentation process indicated that leuconostoc citreum was the most prevalent species, representing 47.6% of the clones. after 27 days of fermentation, clones (genbank accession numbers gq999786 and gq999788) related to unculturable bacteria were the most prevalent, representing 43.8% of the clones from the bacterial community analyzed. the clone represented by the sequence gq999786 was the most prevalent at the end of the fermentation period. the majority of clones obtained from cachaca samples during the fermentation of sugar cane juice were from the genus lactobacillus. lactobacillus nagelli was the most  prevalent at the beginning of the fermentation process, representing 76.9% of the clones analyzed. after 21 days, lactobacillus harbinensis was the most prevalent  species, representing 75% of the total clones. at the end of the fermentation period, lactobacillus buchneri was the most prevalent species, representing 57.9% of the total clones. in the minas cheese samples, lactococcus lactis was the most prevalent species after seven days of ripening. after 60 days of ripening, streptococcus salivarius was the most prevalent species. our data show that these three fermentation processes are conducted by a succession of bacterial species,  of which lactic acid bacteria are the most prevalent.

TI  == skin prick test with self-saliva in patients with oral aphthoses: a diagnostic pathergy for behcet's disease and recurrent aphthosis.
AB  == there may be some difficulties to differentiate behcet's disease (bd), recurrent  aphthosis (ra), and herpetic aphthous ulceration, from other mimicking oral disorders. despite of unexpected sensitivity and responsiveness, the skin pathergy test regarding a non specific hypersensitivity has long been thought as  one of auxiliary diagnostic benefits for bd. to determine the potential usefulness and disease specificity of the prick reaction with saliva, a skin prick test with neat and filter-sterilized saliva was performed on the forearm skin of 26 individuals; 10 patients with bd (8 incomplete type without uveitis, 1 complete type, and 1 neurological type), 5 with ra, 3 with herpetic oral aphthosis, 2 with erythema nodosum alone, and 6 healthy controls. we assessed the skin reaction at 48 hours after pricking, and the pricked skin lesions were biopsied and analyzed immunohistologically. nine of 10 bd patients (90 %) exhibited an indurative erythema at the skin site pricked with self-saliva, whereas 3 of 5 ra patients (60%) were relatively weak reaction. pricking with filter-sterilized saliva failed to recapitulate any of positive skin reactions, albeit a faint erythematous dot appeared in a few bd patients, implicating the involvement of causative microorganism(s) in oral bacterial flora. culture of saliva from 3 randomly chosen bd patients revealed numerous streptococcal colonies on mitis-salivarius agar. histology of the pricked skin sites showed perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, composed of cd4+ t cells and cd68+ monocyte/macrophage lineage, a feature consistent with a delayed type hypersensitive reaction. our results suggested that skin prick test using self-saliva (a new diagnostic pathergy) can be a simple and valuable in vivo diagnostic approach for differentiating bd and ra from other mimicking mucocutaneous diseases. the positive skin prick may be triggered by resident intra-oral microflora, particularly streptococci, and may in part address the underlying immunopathology in bd.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == salivaricin 9, a new lantibiotic produced by streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == salivaricin 9 (sal9) is a 2560 da lantibiotic having just 46 % amino acid identity with its closest known homologue, the streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic sa-ff22. the sal9 locus (designated siv) in streptococcus salivarius strain 9 was partially sequenced and localized to an approximately 170 kb megaplasmid, which also harbours the locus for the lantibiotic salivaricin a4. the entire locus was  fully characterized in the draft genome sequence of s. salivarius strain jim8780  and shown to consist of eight genes, having the following putative functions: sivk, sensor kinase; sivr, response regulator; siva, sal9 precursor peptide; sivm, lantibiotic modification enzyme; sivt, abc transporter involved in the export of sal9 and concomitant cleavage of its leader peptide; and sivfeg, encoding lantibiotic self-immunity. intriguingly, in contrast to strain 9, the siv locus was chromosomally located in strain jim8780--the first lantibiotic locus shown not to be exclusively plasmid-associated in s. salivarius. sal9-containing extracts specifically induced lantibiotic production in both strain 9 and strain jim8780, indicating that sal9 functions as a signal peptide for upregulation of its own biosynthesis. screening representative strains of three streptococcal species (s. salivarius, s. pyogenes and s. mitis) for siva indicated that it was present only in s. salivarius, with 12 of 28 tested s. salivarius positive. since sal9 was inhibitory to all tested s. pyogenes strains  it appears to have potential as an important component of the bacteriocin armoury of s. salivarius probiotics intended to control s. pyogenes infections of the human oral cavity.

TI  == influence of salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  == aim: to investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement (gic) combined with salvadora persica extract (spe). methods: spe was added to gic (fuji ix) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. the antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with  candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. gic containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. results: significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding spe to gic (p<0.05). gic with 2 or 4 % spe was significantly weaker than the gic control, while gic with 1% spe was not different from the control. the mean values for the 4% spe-containing specimens and the gic control group ranged from 108.7mpa to 141.1mpa for cs and from 8.2mpa to 12.5mpa for dts. the 1% spe-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control gic specimens; the 2% spe-containing  specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. as compared with pure gic the antimicrobial properties of the spe-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). it has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the gic with increasing concentrations of spe. for most microorganisms tested the spe group inhibited less than chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure gic (p<0.01). conclusion: spe could be a promising natural material as an additive to gics. further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.

TI  == inhibition of streptococcus mutans biofilm formation by streptococcus salivarius  frua.
AB  == the oral microbial flora consists of many beneficial species of bacteria that are associated with a healthy condition and control the progression of oral disease.  cooperative interactions between oral streptococci and the pathogens play important roles in the development of dental biofilms in the oral cavity. to determine the roles of oral streptococci in multispecies biofilm development and  the effects of the streptococci in biofilm formation, the active substances inhibiting streptococcus mutans biofilm formation were purified from streptococcus salivarius atcc 9759 and ht9r culture supernatants using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry analysis was performed, and the results were compared to databases. the s. salivarius ht9r genome sequence was determined and used to indentify candidate proteins for inhibition.  the candidates inhibiting biofilms were identified as s. salivarius fructosyltransferase (ftf) and exo-beta-d-fructosidase (frua). the activity of the inhibitors was elevated in the presence of sucrose, and the inhibitory effects were dependent on the sucrose concentration in the biofilm formation assay medium. purified and commercial frua from aspergillus niger (31.6% identity and 59.6% similarity to the amino acid sequence of frua from s. salivarius ht9r)  completely inhibited s. mutans gs-5 biofilm formation on saliva-coated polystyrene and hydroxyapatite surfaces. inhibition was induced by decreasing polysaccharide production, which is dependent on sucrose digestion rather than fructan digestion. the data indicate that s. salivarius produces large quantities of frua and that frua alone may play an important role in multispecies microbial  interactions for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation in the oral cavity.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == a simple identification method of saliva by detecting streptococcus salivarius using loop-mediated isothermal amplification.
AB  == we previously reported that detection of streptococcus salivarius is feasible for proving the presence of saliva in a forensic sample. here, a simple and rapid method for the detection of s. salivarius in forensic samples was developed that  uses loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp). the lamp primer set was designed using s. salivarius-specific sequences of glucosyltransferase k. to simplify the procedure, the sample was prepared by boiling and mutanolysin treatment only, and the entire analytical process was completed within 2.5 h. the cut-off value was set at 0.1 absorbance units, measured at 660 nm, upon termination of the reaction. s. salivarius was identified in all saliva samples,  but was not detected in other body fluids or on the skin surface. using this method, s. salivarius was successfully detected in various mock forensic samples. we therefore suggest that this approach is useful for the identification of saliva in forensic practice.

TI  == invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded haecs. the invasion of haecs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. the inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin d on the invasion of haecs were also examined. the production of cytokines by invaded or infected haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger rna. the oral streptococci tested were capable of invading haecs. the number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. after a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the haecs. catalase and cytochalasin d inhibited the invasion of haecs by the organism. haecs invaded by streptococcus mutans xc, streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis), streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded haecs. the haecs invaded by s. mutans xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger rna expression of cytokines by invaded haecs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded haecs. these results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius mutants defective in mannose phosphotransferase systems  show reduced sensitivity to mutacins i-t9 and r-3b.
AB  == twenty-four mutacin-producing streptococcus mutans strains were screened for their propensity to produce class ii one-peptide bacteriocin using a deferred antagonism assay. streptococcus salivarius and 3 mutants defective in their mannose phosphotransferase systems (mannose-pts) were used as sensitive strains to identify which mannose-pts could act as the docking site for class ii one-peptide bacteriocin activity. we observed that only 2 strains of s. mutans, t9 and 3b, potentially produce class ii one-peptide bacteriocin, namely mutacins  i-t9 and r-3b, but with no preference for any mannose-pts complex as a target.

TI  == effects of probiotic lactobacillus salivarius wb21 on halitosis and oral health:  an open-label pilot trial.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to evaluate whether oral administration of lactobacilli alters the degree of halitosis and clinical conditions associated with halitosis. study design: twenty patients with genuine  halitosis were given 2.0 x 10(9)lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablet form daily. oral malodor and clinical parameters were evaluated at the same time of day for each patient after 2 and 4 weeks. results: all 20 patients were positive for l. salivarius dna in their saliva at 2 weeks, although 12 patients were negative for this organism at baseline. oral malodor parameters significantly decreased at 2 weeks in the subjects with physiologic halitosis. the scores of an organoleptic test and bleeding on probing significantly decreased at 4 weeks in the subjects with oral pathologic halitosis. conclusions: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli primarily improved physiologic halitosis and also showed beneficial effects on bleeding on probing from the periodontal pocket.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == alkali production associated with malolactic fermentation by oral streptococci and protection against acid, oxidative, or starvation damage.
AB  == alkali production by oral streptococci is considered important for dental plaque  ecology and caries moderation. recently, malolactic fermentation (mlf) was identified as a major system for alkali production by oral streptococci, including streptococcus mutans. our major objectives in the work described in this paper were to further define the physiology and genetics of mlf of oral streptococci and its roles in protection against metabolic stress damage. l-malic acid was rapidly fermented to l-lactic acid and co(2) by induced cells of wild-type s. mutans, but not by deletion mutants for mles (malolactic enzyme) or  mlep (malate permease). mutants for mler (the contiguous regulator gene) had intermediate capacities for mlf. loss of capacity to catalyze mlf resulted in loss of capacity for protection against lethal acidification. mlf was also found  to be protective against oxidative and starvation damage. the capacity of s. mutans to produce alkali from malate was greater than its capacity to produce acid from glycolysis at low ph values of 4 or 5. mlf acted additively with the arginine deiminase system for alkali production by streptococcus sanguinis, but not with urease of streptococcus salivarius. malolactic fermentation is clearly a major process for alkali generation by oral streptococci and for protection against environmental stresses.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from copaifera langsdorffii desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (ca) was the most active compound displaying mic values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/ml) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ca against the primary causative agent (s. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). also, ca did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, chd) in the checkerboard assays against s. mutans. in conclusion, the results points out ca as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == a preliminary study of biological characteristics of streptococcus oligofermentans in oral microecology.
AB  == this study was designed to explore the biological characteristics of a new oral streptococcus species streptococcus oligofermentans. plaque samples were collected from caries-free and caries-active subjects. s. oligofermentans was selectively grown on mitis salivarius agar plates and identified by using 2-step  pcr and was isolated from 38% of 18 subjects. isolates were found mostly on healthy tooth surfaces. s. oligofermentans had weaker abilities in acid production and demineralizing hydroxyapatite. when streptococcus mutans was coincubated with s. oligofermentans, total number, acid production and calcium release were significantly inhibited. in conclusion, inhibition of s. mutans could be a beneficial biological characteristic of s. oligofermentans in oral microecology.

TI  == detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == an analytical system based on rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) for enumeration of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci was established. subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16s or 23s rrna  from enterococcus, streptococcus, and lactococcus were newly developed. the rt-qpcr method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the enterococcus genus, the streptococcus genus, and several streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qpcr method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces).  the rt-qpcr analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the  genus-specific primer sets revealed that enterococcus and streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and  7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [sd]), respectively. detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique enterococcus species, including the e. avium  subgroup, the e. faecium subgroup, e. faecalis, the e. casseliflavus subgroup, and e. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal streptococcus species was found to be s. salivarius. various lactococcus species, such as l. lactis subsp.  lactis or l. lactis subsp. cremoris, l. garvieae, l. piscium, and l. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram  feces) and prevalence (33%). these results suggest that the rt-qpcr method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as gram-positive cocci.

AB  == aceriphyllum rossii engler (saxifragaceae) have been used as a nutritious food in korea. we found that the methanol extract of a. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, potently inhibited the growth of the key cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, with mic of 2 to 4 microg/ml. they also showed antibacterial activity against other cariogenic bacteria such as s. oralis, s. sobrinus, and s. salivarius with the similar potency. in the time-kill study, aceriphyllic acid a reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by 90% in 1 min at 8 microg/ml, indicating that aceriphyllic acid a had the fast bacteriostatic activity. severe damages of the cell surface of s. mutans by aceriphyllic acid a were observed by transmission electron microscopy, suggesting with its fast antibacterial activity that its mechanism of action might be membrane disruption. these results suggest that the methanol extract of  a. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, could have the great potential as natural agents for preventing dental caries.

TI  == novel analysis of bacterium-substratum bond maturation measured using a quartz crystal microbalance.
AB  == studies in flow displacement systems have shown that the reversibility of bacterial adhesion decreases within seconds to minutes after initial contact of a bacterium with a substratum surface. atomic force microscopy (afm) has confirmed  that the forces mediating bacterial adhesion increase over a similar time span. the interfacial rearrangements between adhering bacteria and substratum surfaces  responsible for this bond maturation have never been studied. quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (qcm-d) senses the interfacial region in real time  and nondisruptively up to 250 nm from the sensor surface. in this paper, qcm-d is combined with real-time observation of bacterial adhesion in a flow displacement  system, in order to analyze resident-time-dependent changes in dissipation. three different streptococcus salivarius strains showed a nonlinear relation between total dissipation shift (deltad) and number of adhering bacteria, whereas inert and rigid silica particles demonstrated a linear relation between deltad and the  number of adhering particles. this suggests removal of interfacial water due to residence time dependent deformation of the nonrigid bacterium-substratum interface during bond maturation. dissipation could be described by an exponentially decaying function, which combined with adhesion data allowed extraction of the dissipation shifts per bacterium upon initial contact (deltad(0)), after bond maturation (deltad(infinity)), as well as a characteristic time constant (tau(bm)). all bacterial strains showed significant  bond maturation within one minute after their arrival at the substratum surface,  which was not observed for silica particles. dissipation analysis at the level of individually adhering bacteria would have been impossible without the simultaneous real-time analysis of bacterial adhesion numbers.

TI  == oral bacteria as potential probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa.
AB  == the research described here was aimed at the selection of oral bacteria that displayed properties compatible with their potential use as probiotics for the pharyngeal mucosa. we included in the study 56 bacteria newly isolated from the pharynges of healthy donors, which were identified at the intraspecies level and  characterized in vitro for their probiotic potential. the experiments led us to select two potential probiotic bacterial strains (streptococcus salivarius rs1 and st3) and to compare them with the prototype oral probiotic s. salivarius strain k12. all three strains efficiently bound to fadu human epithelial pharyngeal cells and thereby antagonized streptococcus pyogenes adhesion and growth. all were sensitive to a variety of antibiotics routinely used for the control of upper respiratory tract infections. immunological in vitro testing on  a fadu layer revealed different responses to rs1, st3, and k12. rs1 and st3 modulated nf-kappab activation and biased proinflammatory cytokines at baseline and after interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) induction. in conclusion, we suggest that  the selected commensal streptococci represent potential pharyngeal probiotic candidates. they could display a good degree of adaptation to the host and possess potential immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.

TI  == degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  == purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was  measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper  prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and  excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.

AB  == in june 2007, the healthcare infection control practices advisory committee (hicpac) recommended for the first time that surgical masks be worn by spinal procedure operators to prevent infections associated with these procedures. hicpac made the recommendation in response to several reports of meningitis following myelography procedures. in september 2008, three bacterial meningitis cases in postpartum women were reported to the new york state department of health (nysdoh); in may 2009, two similar cases were reported to the ohio department of health. all five women had received intrapartum spinal anesthesia.  four were confirmed to have streptococcus salivarius meningitis, and one woman subsequently died. this report summarizes the investigations of these five cases, which determined that the new york cases were associated with one anesthesiologist and the ohio cases were associated with a second anesthesiologist. in ohio, the anesthesiologist did not wear a mask; wearing a mask might have prevented the infections. the findings underscore the need to follow established infection-control recommendations during spinal procedures, including the use of a mask and adherence to aseptic technique.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

AB  == objective: dietary sugar exposures induce an immediate drop of the plaque ph. based on in vitro observations, it was hypothesized that oral bacteria may rapidly respond to this environmental change by increasing the activity or expression of alkali-generating pathways, such as the urease pathway. the objective of this exploratory in vivo study was to determine the short-term effect of a brief sucrose exposure on plaque and saliva urease activity and expression, and to relate this effect to caries experience. methods: urease activity levels were measured in plaque and saliva samples collected from 20 children during fasting conditions and 30 min after rinsing with a sucrose solution. streptococcus salivarius urec-specific mrna in saliva was quantified using real-time rt-pcr. the impact of host-related factors, such as age, gender,  sugar consumption, salivary mutans streptococci levels and caries status on urease activity was evaluated. results: plaque urease activity under fasting conditions was higher in subjects with low caries and mutans streptococci levels. this difference was not observed after the sucrose exposure. the response of urease to sucrose in vivo did not depend on caries experience or salivary mutans  levels. significant increase in urease activity of plaque and saliva after exposure to sucrose was observed only in the subjects who had low urease levels at baseline. conclusions: the findings of this exploratory study suggest that plaque urease activity may have an important long-term influence in caries development but not during a cariogenic challenge.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

TI  == a novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

TI  == the effect of the surface roughness of porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans.
AB  == aim: dental plaque has a harmful influence on periodontal tissue. when a porcelain restoration is fabricated and refinishing of the glazed surface is inevitable, the increase in surface roughness facilitates the adhesion of plaque  and its components. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of  surface roughness of glazed or polished porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans. methods and materials: a total of 80 metal-ceramic specimens were prepared in the form of disks from two porcelain materials and divided into four groups according to the method of surface finishing. surface roughness values (ra-microm) for all specimens were recorded using a profilometer. s. mutans bacteria were isolated from saliva and all specimens were inoculated in test tubes containing a bacterial suspension allowing adhesion of the microorganisms to the specimens to occur. after incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees c, the specimens were transferred to a sterile saline solution and an inoculum of 0.1 ml from each selected dilution was spread on the selective medium, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb). bacterial counts, expressed in colony forming unit (cfu) taking into consideration the dilution factor, were recorded. results: there was significant correlation (p<0.05) between surface roughness values (ra-microm) and the amount of bacterial adhesion (cfu x 10(3)).  the glazed surface was the smoothest and exhibited the least amount of bacterial  adhesion. conclusion: a positive correlation between surface roughness and the amount of s. mutans adhesion was observed. the glazed porcelain surface was considered more biocompatible than other methods of porcelain surface finishing.  clinical significance: chairside adjustments of the cervical contour or occlusal  surface of porcelain restorations are sometimes necessary before or after cementation. ideally, an uncemented restoration should be returned to the laboratory for reglazing after all adjustments have been completed. it is important to evaluate various polishing procedures used for these adjusted surfaces to achieve a finished surface that as closely as possible approximates the quality of glazed porcelain.

TI  == infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with rothia mucilaginosa bacteremia: a case report.
AB  == infections with rare pathogens are being recognized with increasing frequency in  severely immunocompromised patients. as a result of these patients' underlying compromised defenses and susceptibility to atypical organisms, tissue biopsies from patients within this population may demonstrate nonclassical histopathological findings. here, we describe an unusual granulomatous reaction to gram-positive cocci in the skin of a 52-year-old man undergoing salvage chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. the patient presented with a papular eruption on the arms, trunk, and face and fever; concomitant blood cultures were  positive for rothia mucilaginosa and streptococcus salivarius. histologic evaluation revealed a granulomatous dermatitis associated with numerous small, round, predominantly intracellular bacteria. classically, cutaneous infiltrates associated with coccoid bacterial infections are suppurative and not granulomatous. the intracellular organisms stained positive for gram, periodic acid-schiff, and grocott methenamine silver stains, suggestive of r. mucilaginosa. rothia mucilaginosa, a component of the oral flora, was first reported as a human pathogen in 1978. although the majority of cases in the literature have described r. mucilaginosa bacteremia, other reported manifestations include meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and peritonitis. to our knowledge, however, only 1 prior report has described a cutaneous manifestation of r. mucilaginosa septicemia, which occurred in a patient with neutropenia. this is the second reported case of an infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with r. mucilaginosa bacteremia and raises awareness of this unusual histopathological presentation in the setting of a bacterial infection affecting the skin.

TI  == horizontal transmission of mutans streptococci in children.
AB  == it has not been established whether transmission of mutans streptococci occurs between unrelated children older than 4 years of age. the aim of the study was to investigate the possible transmission of mutans streptococci genotypes from child to child in kindergarten. we studied 96 children (ages 5-6 yrs) in three san francisco bay area public schools. mutans streptococci colonies from each child were isolated from selective culture on mitis salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar. we used arbitrary primed polymerase chain reactions to determine the mutans streptococci genotypes. two children (not siblings) in each of the three schools  (6%) shared an identical amplitype of s. mutans, unique to each pair. the 19 s. sobrinus amplitypes were found in 12 children, and all were unique to each child. the presence of matching genotypes of s. mutans demonstrates horizontal transmission of this species between unrelated children aged 5-6 years.

TI  == emergence of a cell wall protease in the streptococcus thermophilus population.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is perceived as a recently emerged food bacterium that evolved from a commensal ancestor by loss and gain of functions. here, we provide data allowing a better understanding of this evolutionary scheme. a multilocus sequence typing approach that we developed showed that s. thermophilus diverges significantly from its potential ancestors of the salivarius group and displays a low level of allelic variability, confirming its likely recent emergence. an analysis of the origin and dissemination of the prts gene was carried out within  this evolutionary scheme. this gene encodes a protease that allows better growth  in milk by facilitating casein breakdown to supply amino acids. the s. thermophilus protease exhibits 95% identity to the animal streptococcus suis protein prts. genomic analysis showed that prts is part of an island flanked by two tandem insertion sequence elements and containing three other genes which present the best identities and synteny with the s. suis genome. these data indicate a potential origin for this "ecological" island in a species closely related to s. suis. the analysis of the distribution of the prts gene in s. thermophilus showed that the gene is infrequent in historical collections but frequent in recent industrial ones. moreover, this "ecological" island conferring an important metabolic trait for milk adaptation appears to have disseminated by  lateral transfer in the s. thermophilus population. taken together, these data support an evolutionary scheme of s. thermophilus where gene acquisition and selection by food producers are determining factors. the source and impact of genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer on the physiology and safety of strains should be addressed.

TI  == screening of quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  == background and objectives: a number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. this increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. we report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and streptococcus sanguis (isolated). materials and methods: the cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. results: methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. the most susceptible bacteria were s. sanguis followed  by s. aureus, s. mutans, s. salivarius and l. acidophilus. the mic values showed  that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. conclusion: the plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. the crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. these chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == antagonistic action of indigenous streptococcus mutans strains.
AB  == dental caries is an infectious process which ultimately destroys the tooth. streptococcus mutans is considered to be the main agent causing this disease. if  microorganisms with antagonistic action on s. mutans were found, they might provide a way of avoiding or controlling the disease. within the framework of the oral microbial ecology approach, the aim of this project was to identify s. mutans strains with antagonistic effect upon s. mutans. saliva samples were taken from 66 children and cultured on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. they were incubated at 37 degrees c in anaerobic atmosphere for 48 hours, after which bacteria were counted and biochemical tests performed on colonies compatible with s. mutans. antagonistic effect was determined using the double layer in agar technique. in children without and with caries, the frequency of s. mutans was 91.7% and 96.7%, respectively. in the group of patients without caries, only two strains had no antagonistic action, and three strains had full antagonistic action (100%), while the rest showed different kinds of inhibitory action. in the group of patients with caries, only 5 strains had no antagonistic  action, 32 strains had full antagonistic action (100%) and the rest had variable  inhibitory action. to conclude, 112 s. mutans strains with high antagonistic potential were identified, which, after other requirements are fulfilled, could be used in caries prevention or control strategies.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == kinetic studies of hpr, hpr(h15d), hpr(h15e), and hpr(his approximately p) phosphorylation by the streptococcus salivarius hpr(ser) kinase/phosphorylase.
AB  == hpr is a central protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). in streptococci, hpr can be phosphorylated at his(15) at  the expense of pep by enzyme i (ei) of the pts, producing hpr(his approximately p). hpr can also be phosphorylated at ser(46) by the atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase/phosphorylase (hprk/p), producing hpr(ser-p). lastly, hpr can be phosphorylated on both residues, producing hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p) (hpr-p2). we report here a study on the phosphorylation of streptococcus salivarius hpr, hpr(h15d), hpr(h15e), and hpr(his approximately p) by hprk/p to assess the involvement of hprk/p in the synthesis of hpr-p2 in streptococcal cells. we first developed a spectrophotometric method for measuring hprk/p kinase activity. using this assay, we found that the k(m) of hprk/p for hpr at ph 7.4 and 37 degrees c was approximately 110 mum, with a specificity constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of 1.7 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1). the specificity constants for hpr(h15d) and hpr(h15e) were approximately 13 times lower. kinetic studies conducted under  conditions where hpr(his approximately p) was stable (i.e., ph 8.6 and 15 degrees c) showed that hpr(his approximately p) was a poorer substrate for hprk/p than hpr(h15d), the k(cat)/k(m) for hpr(h15d) and hpr(his approximately p) being approximately 9 and 26 times lower than that for hpr, respectively. our results suggested that (i) the inefficiency of the phosphorylation of hpr(his approximately p) by hprk/p results from the presence of a negative charge at position 15 as well as from other structural elements and (ii) the contribution of streptococcal hprk/p to the synthesis of hpr-p2 in vivo is marginal.

TI  == streptococcal bacteriocins and the case for streptococcus salivarius as model oral probiotics.
AB  == members of the gram-positive bacterial genus streptococcus are a diverse collection of species inhabiting many body sites and range from benign, nonpathogenic species to those causing life-threatening infections. the streptococci are also prolific producers of bacteriocins, which are ribosomally synthesized proteinaceous antibiotics that kill or inhibit species closely related to the producer bacterium. with the emergence of bacterial resistance to  conventional antibiotics, there is an impetus to discover, and implement, new and preferably 'natural' antibiotics to treat or prevent bacterial infections, a niche that bacterial interference therapy mediated by bacteriocins could easily fill. this review focuses on describing the diversity of bacteriocins produced by streptococci and also puts forth a case for streptococcus salivarius, a nonpathogenic and numerically predominant oral species, as an ideal candidate for development as the model probiotic for the oral cavity. s. salivarius is a safe species that not only produces broad-spectrum bacteriocins but harbors bacteriocin-encoding (and bacteriocin-inducing) transmissible dna entities (megaplasmids).

TI  == frequency and distribution of mutans streptococci in dental plaque from caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children.
AB  == mutans streptococci, in particular s. mutans and s. sobrinus, are generally considered to be the prime etiological bacteria of human dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of mutans streptococci in dental plaque in three groups of caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children aged 2-6, 7-12, 13-19 years, and their possible association with dental caries. the frequency of mutans streptococci was determined in samples of pooled dental plaque collected from all detectable sources of 30 (62.5%) caries-affected and 18 (37.5%) caries-free children. the samples were collected from all available tooth sites using a hollenbak probe and immediately suspended in ringer's solution, serially diluted and cultured in mitis salivarius (ms) agar for total streptococci determination and mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) for isolation of mutans streptococci. the bacterial identification procedure was done using the api rapid strep system. the criteria used to determine dmft and dmft was established by klein and palmer (1941). mean dmft and dmft were 6.4 +/- 3.2 and 4.4 +/- 2.9, respectively. ten (33%) out of 30 caries-affected children harbored  mutans streptococci. the species most frequently found were s. mutans (20%), s. sobrinus (10%) and s. rattus (3.3%). meanwhile, in the caries-free group only 6 out of 18 children (33%) harbored mutans streptococci, specifically s. mutans and s. sobrinus, both at 17%, with no significant difference between the two groups.  these results indicate that the percentage of children that harbored mutans streptococci was similar in both groups, suggesting that other acidogenic species may be responsible for caries development.

TI  == the streptococcal inhibitor of complement (sic) protects streptococcus pyogenes from bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius inhibits the growth of streptococcus pyogenes in vitro.  streptococcus pyogenes has various virulence factors, including the streptococcus inhibitor of complement (sic). although sic inhibits the activity of the peptides ll-37 and nap1, the relationship between sic and the bacteriocin-like inhibitory  substance (blis) has not been elucidated. here, we evaluated whether s. salivarius blis affects s. pyogenes sic. we created three deltasic mutant strains from three s. pyogenes strains and performed deferred antagonism assays. the test strains were blis-positive s. salivarius jcm5707 and blis-negative s. salivarius  ncu12. deferred antagonism assays with jcm5707 showed that the inhibitory zones in the three deltasic mutant strains were wider than those in the three wild-type strains. streptococcus pyogenes was cultured in blis-containing broth and the change in sic in the supernatant was assessed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de). the 2-de analysis of s. pyogenes exoproteins with the jcm5707 supernatant showed reduced sic compared with those without the jcm5707 supernatant. changes in sic mrna levels affected by s. salivarius blis were evaluated by a reverse transcriptase-pcr. the sic mrna level was affected more by the blis-positive s. salivarius than by the blis-negative strain. our result indicates that sic plays a role in the inhibition of s. salivarius blis.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

AB  == ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western uganda. however, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. the aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. the most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. l. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. two of the four most commonly isolated lab species (l. helveticus and l. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (pcr-dgge). other main lab species identified in mashita by pcr-dgge were bifidobacterium sp., enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus acetotolerans, lactobacillus sp., lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius. the main species of acetic acid bacteria (aab) identified in the mashita using pcr-dgge method were acetobacter aceti, acetobacter lovaniensis, acetobacter orientalis and acetobacter pasteurianus. pcr-dgge identification of yeasts showed that brettanomyces custersianus, candida silvae, geotrichum sp., issatchenkia occidentalis, issatchenkia orientalis, kluyveromyces marxianus, saccharomyces cerevisiae, and trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. a. lovaniensis, a. aceti, and i. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using pcr-dgge method. other microbial species were only found in some samples. these results indicate that lab and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also aab are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.

TI  == culture-based pcr analysis of plaque samples of japanese school children to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria and its association with caries risk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to assess the presence of six common cariogenic bacteria from cariostat-inoculated plaque samples of japanese elementary school children through pcr analysis and check its associations with caries risk testing the validity of cariostat as a caries risk assessment tool. this epidemiological school-based study investigated plaque samples of 399 japanese elementary school  children. assessed using the cariostat, 48.2% of the children had high caries risk. dna detection of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum and both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was seen in 65.2%, 24.1%, 69.7%, 17.5%, 7.8%, 19.3%, and 17.3% of the participants, respectively. except for s. salivarius, the presence of all other investigated bacteria resulted in a statistically significant increase among the proportion of subjects with high caries risk. caries risk assessed using cariostat was significantly influenced by the presence of cariogenic bacteria. being a selective medium for cariogenic bacteria, the cariostat can be a useful and direct source of cariogenic bacterial dna for pcr analysis while effectively assessing caries risk.

TI  == levofloxacin versus azithromycin on the oropharyngeal carriage and selection of antibacterial- resistant streptococci in the microflora of healthy adults.
AB  == objective: to determine the proportion of subjects with oropharyngeal streptococci resistant to either levofloxacin or azithromycin prior to and during antibacterial exposure, and to follow temporal changes in the proportion of resistant and susceptible isolates through 6 weeks post-exposure. this randomized, open-label, single-center study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: nct00821782). research design and methods: a total of 143 healthy volunteers (levofloxacin, n = 71; azithromycin, n = 72) without antibacterial exposure in the previous 90 days received either levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 5 days or azithromycin 500 mg once daily on day 1 and 250 mg once daily on days 2 through 5. oropharyngeal cultures were obtained pre-exposure, at day 5, and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-dosing. bacterial strains were identified and the minimum inhibitory concentrations for levofloxacin and azithromycin were determined. results: at study entry 117 streptococci were isolated from 72 subjects randomized to azithromycin and 53 (45.3%) were azithromycin-resistant. none of the 121 streptococci isolated from 71 subjects randomized to.levofloxacin were colonized by a levofloxacin-resistant microorganism prior to dosing. at the  end of dosing, the number of subjects with resistant streptococci (s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, or alpha streptococcus species [spp.]) increased in azithromycin-exposed subjects and resistant isolates remained through 6 weeks post-dosing. in contrast, a small number of levofloxacin-resistant streptococci were observed at the end of dosing but decreased by week 2 post-dosing and continued to decrease through the 6-week evaluation period (p < 0.001 azithromycin vs. levofloxacin for s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and alpha streptococcus spp. at week 6). limitations of this study included the fact that,  since previous antibiotic use was self-reported, genetic typing was not done. the results of this study may not be completely generalizable, because subjects in this study received study drug under directly-observed conditions, thus ensuring  compliance. conclusions: both antibacterial agents were well tolerated. levofloxacin 750 mg administered for 5 days was associated with less microbial resistance than that observed with azithromycin in healthy subjects.

TI  == polymicrobial keratitis after a collagen cross-linking procedure with postoperative use of a contact lens: a case report.
AB  == purpose: : to report a case of polymicrobial keratitis caused by streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. in a  patient who underwent collagen cross-linking for keratoconus. method: : case report. result: : a 32-year-old male presented with a 1-day history of a painful  red eye, occurring 3 days after he had undergone a collagen cross-linking with riboflavin and uv-a on his left eye for keratoconus. he admitted to removing his  bandage contact lens and cleaning it in his mouth before reapplying it in his eye. on presentation, a severe keratitis with an 8-mm epithelial defect and 360-degree ring infiltrate was found. culture results from his contact lens were  positive for s. salivarius and s. oralis, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus sp. were grown from his corneal scrapings. conclusions: : collagen cross-linking  is a promising procedure for the treatment of progressive keratoconus with minimal reported side effects. however, the possibility of a secondary infection  after the procedure exists because the patient is subjected to epithelial debridement and the application of a soft contact lens. the role of the uv light  on the immune mechanisms of the cornea and its effect on corneal wound healing warrant further investigation.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

AB  == necrobacillosis, postanginal septicaemia or lemierre's syndrome is characterised  by suppurative thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with embolization to several sites, including the lungs. we report the case of a 38-year-old man who was initially hospitalized because of odontogenic cellulitis. given the deterioration of his clinical state (septic shock and multiple organ failure), neck computed tomography was performed, revealing both cervical and parotid abscesses, and thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein. streptococcus salivarius was isolated. the patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics, and surgical drainage and after 6 weeks of treatment, recovered completely. lemierre's syndrome is an uncommon, but potentially lethal complication of an odontogenic infection. the case reported here is interesting since the pathogen and the site of primary infection are unusual. fusobacterium necrophorum is the most common pathogen in lemierre's syndrome, and to the best of our knowledge there are no similar case reports with streptococcus salivarius as the causative  bacteria. early recognition and high-dose antibiotics are critical elements in reducing mortality.

TI  == pcr detection of bacterial genes provides evidence of death by drowning.
AB  == we have developed a sensitive and specific pcr method for detecting plankton dna  in cases of death by drowning. however, this pcr method could not be used for cases of drowning in water containing no plankton. bacteria species are normally  localized in the throat and trachea and they may invade into blood through the respiratory tract in people who have drowned as well as species localized in water. the aim of this study was to establish a novel and expedient pcr method for detecting bacterial genes in samples from drowning cases. we designed primer  pairs for streptococcus salivarius (sl1) and streptococcus sanguinis (sn1), which are common species in the throat, and for aeromonas hydrophila (ah1), which has been found in various water samples. with sl1, sn1, and ah1, we detected 10, 0.1, and 1 pg of target dna, respectively. among 19 drowned cases within 3 days postmortem, sl-dna was detected in all of the blood samples from hearts with sl1  and ah-dna was detected in several samples with ah1. in a case of drowning in a bathtub, use of the conventional acid digestion method for diatom analyses and the pcr method for identifying plankton dna revealed no plankton, but our pcr method for detecting bacterial dna showed a positive result for sl-dna in a blood sample from the heart. in conclusion, our novel pcr method is highly specific and sensitive for detecting bacterial dna and is useful for cases of death by drowning in water containing no plankton.

TI  == inhibiting effects of streptococcus salivarius on competence-stimulating peptide-dependent biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == introduction: the effects of streptococcus salivarius on the competence-stimulating peptide (csp)-dependent biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans were investigated. methods: biofilms were grown on 96-well microtiter plates coated with salivary components in tryptic soy broth without dextrose supplemented with 0.25% sucrose. biofilm formations were stained using safranin and quantification of stained biofilms was performed by measuring absorbance at 492 nm. results: s. mutans formed substantial biofilms, whereas biofilms of s. salivarius were formed poorly in the medium conditions used. furthermore, in combination cultures, s. salivarius strongly inhibited biofilm formation when cultured with s. mutans. this inhibition occurred in the early phase of biofilm formation and was dependent on inactivation of the csp of s. mutans, which is associated with competence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial activity of the  bacterium, and is induced by expression of the comc gene. comparisons between the s. mutans clinical strains fsc-3 and fsc-3deltaglra in separate dual-species cultures with s. salivarius indicated that the presence of the bacitracin transport atp-binding protein gene glra caused susceptibility to inhibition of s. mutans biofilm formation by s. salivarius, and was also associated with the regulation of csp production by com gene-dependent quorum sensing systems. conclusion: it is considered that regulation of csp by glra in s. mutans and csp  inactivation by s. salivarius are important functions for cell-to-cell communication between biofilm bacteria and oral streptococci such as s. salivarius. our results provide useful information for understanding the ecosystem of oral streptococcal biofilms, as well as the competition between and  coexistence of multiple species in the oral cavity.

TI  == analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == intramammary infection (imi), also known as mastitis, is the most frequently occurring and economically the most important infectious disease in dairy cattle. this study provides a validation of the analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time pcr-based assay that identifies 11 major pathogen species or species  groups responsible for imi, and a gene coding for staphylococcal beta-lactamase production (penicillin resistance). altogether, 643 culture isolates originating  from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed  using the assay. the isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in europe and north america. the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the assay was 100% in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). when considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 1 streptococcus salivarius, and 1 streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as streptococcus uberis, and 3 shigella spp. strains were identified as escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99% in strep. uberis and to 99.5% in e. coli. these false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. specificity and sensitivity remained at 100% for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection. in conclusion, the real-time pcr assay shows excellent analytical accuracy and holds much promise for use in routine bovine imi testing programs. this study provides the basis for evaluating the assay's diagnostic performance against the conventional bacterial culture method in clinical field trials using  mastitis milk samples.

AB  == nonhemolytic streptococci (nhs) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of  all species in this group of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer (its) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant nhs to the species level. sequence analysis of the its region was performed with 57 nhs reference or clinical strains. satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 nhs species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the its region. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the its region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. these five species could be identified to the group level only by its sequence analysis. partial gdh sequence analysis was  applied to the 11 s. oralis strains, the 11 s. mitis strains, and the 17 s. pneumoniae strains. all except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification  to the species level. a phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. we suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the its region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of nhs.

AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == influence of cell surface appendages on the bacterium-substratum interface measured real-time using qcm-d.
AB  == quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (qcm-d) utilizes an oscillating quartz crystal to register adsorption of rigid masses through a decrease in its resonance frequency f. in addition, qcm-d has the ability to measure the dissipative nature of nonrigid masses adhering to the crystal surface in the form of oscillation amplitude decay time. although qcm has been applied to register bacterial adhesion to the crystal surface, full interpretation of the frequency change and dissipation signal has hitherto been impossible due to the complex interactions within the distance of 250 nm between the substratum and the bacterial cell surface. here, we study adhesion of a series of streptococcus salivarius mutants, possessing various surface appendages of known lengths, as a  function of time using qcm-d. in addition, the number of bacteria adhering to the crystal surface was determined. the results show that adhesion of a "bald" bacterium, completely devoid of surface appendages, is registered as a frequency  decrease. adhesion of bacteria possessing surface appendages yields either a much smaller decrease or an increase in frequency, despite the fact they adhere in higher numbers. furthermore, the magnitude of frequency and dissipation shifts was found to be influenced by the distance at which the cell body was held from the sensor surface by its surface appendages.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the levels of secretory iga (siga), ph, flow rates, mutans streptococci (ms) and candida in saliva of children with rampant caries compared to those caries-free. thirty children (age 62-123 months) were enrolled and divided into two groups: group i, children with rampant caries, group ii, caries-free children. the average salivary flow rate was measured from  the volume yielded within 5 minutes and the ph was determined using a ph-electrode. measurement of siga was performed using an immunoassay kit. the levels of ms and candida were determined by culture on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. it was found that children with rampant caries presented with significantly higher levels of salivary siga, ms and candida. however, the mean values for salivary flow rates and ph were similar between the groups. the results reveal that children with rampant caries had significantly higher levels of siga, ms and candida in their oral cavities. this  finding tends to support the hypothesis that higher levels of salivary siga may reflect a past exposure of the host to cariogenic microorganisms.

AB  == we report the isolation and characterization of an unusual strain of streptococcus salivarius, 3c30, displaying both the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b and the tetracycline resistance phenotypes. it harbours the mef(e), erm(b), and tet(m) genes carried by different genetic elements. the genetic element carrying mef(e), named mega, was investigated by long pcr and sequencing, while the presence of the tn3872-like element, carrying  tet(m) and erm(b), was demonstrated by sequencing of both the int-xis-tn and the  fragment between the two resistance genes. in strain 3c30 the mega element is 5388 bp in size and its nucleotide sequence is identical to that of the element described previously in s. salivarius, with the exception of a 912 bp deletion at the left end. the composite tn3872-like element appeared to be nonconjugative while the mega element was transferred by conjugation to streptococcus pneumoniae. it was, however, impossible to transfer it again from these transconjugants to other strains. in addition, only in the 3c30 strain did mega form circular structures, as identified by real-time pcr. in conclusion, we found a clinical strain of s. salivarius carrying both mega and tn3872-like genetic elements. mega is transferable by conjugation to s. pneumoniae but it is not transferable again from the transconjugants, suggesting a possible mobilization by recombinases of the coresident tn3872-like transposon.

TI  == reduction in bacterial contamination of toothbrushes using the violight ultraviolet light activated toothbrush sanitizer.
AB  == purpose: this two armed, self-controlled, investigator blinded, clinical study tested the efficacy of an ultraviolet (uv) light toothbrush holder (violight) to  decrease toothbrush bacterial contamination. methods: 25 subjects were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups and received two toothbrushes for home use on either even or odd days. the control group rinsed both toothbrushes after  use in cold tap water with no mechanical manipulation. the experimental group rinsed one toothbrush in cold running water while storing the other toothbrush in the violight toothbrush holder after use. the toothbrushes were returned after 2  weeks use in sealed plastic bags and were analyzed for the number of colony forming units (cfu) of s. mutans, s. salivarius, lactobacilli, e. coli, and other coliforms, and total bacterial counts by culture. an additional analysis of the total bacterial profile was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). results: the violight toothbrush holder reduced total cfu by an average of 86% (ancova, p = 0.037). in addition, a tendency was noted for a reduction in total bacterial population as detected by dgge.

TI  == streptococci and lactococci synthesize large amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p).
AB  == hpr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). in gram-positive bacteria, hpr can be phosphorylated on ser-46 by the kinase/phosphorylase hprk/p and on his-15 by phospho-enzyme i (ei~p) of the pts. in vitro studies with purified hprs from bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. however, a recent study showed that while the rate of streptococcus salivarius hpr phosphorylation by ei~p is reduced at acidic ph, the phosphorylation of hpr(ser-p) by ei~p, generating hpr(ser-p)(his~p), is stimulated. this suggests that hpr(ser-p)(his~p) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular ph near neutrality. consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p) have been detected in some streptococci. the present study was  aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize hpr(ser-p)(his~p) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable  to maintain their intracellular ph near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular ph. our results indicated that unlike staphylococcus aureus, b. subtilis, and e. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p) during growth. we also showed that streptococcus salivarius iiablman, a protein involved in sugar transport by the pts, could be efficiently phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p).

TI  == a novel method for the identification of saliva by detecting oral streptococci using pcr.
AB  == we have used dna amplification methods to detect common oral bacterial strains to test for the presence of saliva in forensic samples. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mutans were detected in various forms of saliva samples, whereas these streptococci were not detected in semen, urine, vaginal fluid, or on skin surfaces. therefore, we demonstrated that these streptococci are promising new marker for the forensic identification of saliva. our data indicated that s. salivarius is more reliable than s. mutans as an indicator of saliva presence, because the detection rates for s. salivarius and s. mutans by this method were 100% and 90%, respectively. furthermore, s. salivarius was detected in all saliva stain samples, whereas s. mutans was only identified in 60% of the stains. finally, using this method we were able to successfully detect s. salivarius and  s. mutans in mock forensic samples. we therefore suggested that this method is useful for the identification of saliva in forensic science.

AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered important in the adhesion process of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. this study addressed the hypothesis that a streptococcal biofilm influences the hard tissue colonization by the periodontopathogen aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans under hydrodynamic conditions. methods: the colonization of a green-fluorescent-protein-labelled a. actinomycetemcomitans strain on surfaces coated with a streptococcal biofilm, was monitored in real time using a confocal  laser scanning microscope-mounted flow cell. culture and quantitative polymerase  chain reaction data were obtained in parallel from a modified robbins device. results: colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited by the four tested streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus mitis). the most inhibiting species was s. sanguinis. conclusion: these results confirmed the hypothesis that some bacterial species influence a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of hard surfaces in vitro under hydrodynamic conditions.

TI  == sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine effect in the inhibition of mutans streptococci in children with dental caries: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == objective: we aimed to compare the effect of sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms), in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. methods: thirty-five healthy volunteers, aged 4-8 years, with at  least one active carious lesion and no previous history of allergies were selected to participate in the study. a gel formulation containing either 1.23% sodium fluoride or 1% chlorhexidine was topically administered to the dentition every 24 h for 6 consecutive days. salivary ms levels were measured at baseline (d1) and on the 6th (d6), 15th (d15), and 30th (d30) days. for microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. results: difference between treatments was only verified on d6. on the last day of treatment 1% chlorhexidine gel was significantly more effective than fluoride (p = 0.0000). the use of sodium fluoride did not cause a statistically significant variation in salivary ms levels throughout the duration of the study. following treatment, a subsequent increase in ms counts between d6 and d15 (p = 0.0001) was observed with chlorhexidine. conclusion: a 6-day treatment with a 1% chlorhexidine gel was effective in reducing salivary ms; there was a significant ms increase once treatment was suspended. the use of 1.23% sodium fluoride under the same regimen  was not able to reduce salivary ms levels. our results suggest repeated treatment with 1% chlorhexidine as a means for maintaining low salivary ms levels in children with dental caries.

TI  == bacteriocins in s. mutans strains isolated from children with and without dental  caries: biotypes and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the production of bacteriocins in the streptococcus mutans strains isolated from children with and without dental caries. with this purpose the dmft index was determined and non-stimulated saliva was collected from 53 3- to 5-year-old children. the samples were cultured on mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and incubated anaerobically for two days at 37 degrees c. the isolates were biotyped using the api-zym enzymatic system (biomerieux; marcy-le'toile, france). bacteriocin was detected using the double layer onto brain heart infusion agar technique and the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the isolates were evaluated against penicillin, amoxycillin, cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, imipenem and vancomycin using an agar dilution method. the dental caries experience in these children was 66% (35/53) and dmft index average was 3.2 (range 2-6). s. mutans was found in the saliva of  33 children (62%). in the 33 strains of s. mutans, 10 biotypes were found. eight  (24%) of the 33 strains evaluated produced bacteriocins, 6 of these strains came  from patients with dental caries and the other two from patients without dental caries. all isolates were highly sensitive to the antibiotics tested.

AB  == objectives: to assess total streptococci (ts) counts and biofilm mass over tooth-tissue-borne palatal expander (ttbpe), as well as the effect of chlorhexidine (chx) mouth rinse on these variables. design: a cross-sectional study design employed clinical procedures and laboratorial techniques. setting and sample population: patients who had ttbpe removal indicated were divided into two groups: a chx group (n = 26) in which three times a day of 0.2% chx digluconate mouth rinses were prescribed 7 days before ttbpe removal; and a control (con) group (n = 25) in which no antimicrobial treatment was applied. experimental variable: 'gender', 'age', and 'ttbpe wear time' were recorded. after ttbpe removal, biofilm mass was determined by the difference between (ttbpe + biofilm) and (ttbpe only) masses. ts counts were determined by biofilm suspension followed by progressive dilutions and culture on mitis salivarius agar with incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h. outcome measure: biofilm mass (mg) and  colony forming units of ts / mg of biofilm (cfu-ts / mg) were calculated. results - total streptococci mean values in chx (6.77 x 10(6)cfu-ts / mg) were statistically lower (p < 0.01) than those in con (3.82 x 10(7)cfu-ts / mg), but there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between chx (168.88 mg) and con (182.04 mg) masses nor statistical correlation (p > 0.05) between biofilm mass and cfu-ts / mg in the two groups. conclusion: chlorhexidine reduces the ts counts in ttbpe, but has no effect on biofilm mass.

TI  == the commensal streptococcus salivarius k12 downregulates the innate immune responses of human epithelial cells and promotes host-microbe homeostasis.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is an early colonizer of human oral and nasopharyngeal epithelia, and strain k12 has reported probiotic effects. an emerging paradigm indicates that commensal bacteria downregulate immune responses through the action on nf-kappab signaling pathways, but additional mechanisms underlying probiotic actions are not well understood. our objective here was to identify host genes specifically targeted by k12 by comparing their responses with responses elicited by pathogens and to determine if s. salivarius modulates epithelial cell immune responses. rna was extracted from human bronchial epithelial cells (16hbe14o- cells) cocultured with k12 or bacterial pathogens. cdna was hybridized to a human 21k oligonucleotide-based array. data were analyzed using arraypipe, innatedb, panther, and opossum. interleukin 8 (il-8) and growth-regulated oncogene alpha (groalpha) secretion were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. it was demonstrated that s. salivarius k12 specifically altered the expression of 565 host genes, particularly those involved in multiple innate defense pathways, general epithelial cell function and homeostasis, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell development and migration, and signaling pathways. it inhibited baseline il-8 secretion and il-8 responses to ll-37, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and flagellin in epithelial cells and attenuated groalpha secretion in response to flagellin. immunosuppression was coincident with the inhibition of activation of the nf-kappab pathway. thus, the commensal and probiotic behaviors of s. salivarius k12 are proposed to be due to the organism (i) eliciting no proinflammatory response, (ii) stimulating an anti-inflammatory response, and (iii) modulating genes associated with adhesion to the epithelial layer and homeostasis. s. salivarius k12 might thereby ensure that it is tolerated by the host and maintained on the epithelial surface while actively protecting the host from inflammation and apoptosis induced by pathogens.

TI  == oral bacteria in biofilms exhibit slow reactivation from nutrient deprivation.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to enter a non-growing state is believed to be an important mechanism for survival in the starved micro-environments of the oral cavity. in this study, we examined the reactivation of nutrient-deprived cells of two oral bacteria in biofilms, streptococcus anginosus and lactobacillus salivarius. non-growing cells were generated by incubation in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer for 24 h and the results were compared to those of planktonic cultures. when both types of cells were shifted from a rich, peptone-yeast extract-glucose (pyg) medium to buffer for 24 h, dehydrogenase and esterase activity measured by the fluorescent dyes 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl-tetrazolium chloride (ctc) and fluorescein diacetate (fda), respectively, was absent in both  species. however, the membranes of the vast majority of nutrient-deprived cells remained intact as assessed by live/dead staining. metabolic reactivation of the  nutrient-deprived biofilm cells was not observed for at least 48 h following addition of fresh pyg medium, whereas the non-growing planktonic cultures of the  same two strains were in rapid growth in less than 2 h. at 72 h, the s. anginosus biofilm cells had recovered 78 % of the dehydrogenase activity and 61 % of the esterase activity and the biomass mm(-2) had increased by 30-35 %. with l. salivarius at 72 h, the biofilms had recovered 56 % and 75 % of dehydrogenase and esterase activity, respectively. reactivation of both species in biofilms was enhanced by removal of glucose from pyg, and s. anginosus cells were particularly responsive to yeast extract (ye) medium. the data suggest that the low reactivity of non-growing biofilm cells to the introduction of fresh nutrients may be a survival strategy employed by micro-organisms in the oral cavity.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy of common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (oct). methods: the antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. after unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30seconds. saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. results: oct had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) and 7.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex (pvp-i) from 15min to 120min following the application (p<0.01). the antiseptic efficacy of 0.2% chx on total  bacteria and lactobacillus species was very similar to the efficacy observed with 7.5% pvp-i mouth solution from 15min up to 120min. streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0.15mg/ml pvp-i, 0.5mg/ml chx, and 0.1mg/ml oct concentrations, while streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0.15mg/ml pvp-i,  2mg/ml chx, and 0.8mg/ml oct concentrations. lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0.00313mg/ml oct, 30mg/ml pvp-i, and 0.0063mg/ml chx concentrations. conclusions: oct compared favorably with chx and pvp-i in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p<0.01).

AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == salk/salr, a two-component signal transduction system, is essential for full virulence of highly invasive streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == background: streptococcus suis serotype 2 (s. suis 2, ss2) has evolved into a highly infectious entity, which caused the two recent large-scale outbreaks of human ss2 epidemic in china, and is characterized by a toxic shock-like syndrome. however, the molecular pathogenesis of this new emerging pathogen is still poorly understood. methodology/principal findings: 89k is a newly predicted pathogenicity island (pai) which is specific to chinese epidemic strains isolated from these two ss2 outbreaks. further bioinformatics analysis revealed a unique two-component signal transduction system (tcsts) located in the candidate 89k pai, which is orthologous to the salk/salr regulatory system of streptococcus salivarius. knockout of salkr eliminated the lethality of ss2 in experimental infection of piglets. functional complementation of salkr into the isogenic mutant deltasalkr restored its soaring pathogenicity. colonization experiments showed that the deltasalkr mutant could not colonize any susceptible tissue of piglets when administered alone. bactericidal assays demonstrated that resistance of the mutant to polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn)-mediated killing was greatly decreased. expression microarray analysis exhibited a transcription profile alteration of 26 various genes down-regulated in the deltasalkr mutant. conclusions/significance: these findings suggest that salk/salr is requisite for  the full virulence of ethnic chinese isolates of highly pathogenic ss2, thus providing experimental evidence for the validity of this bioinformatically predicted pai.

AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

AB  == the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb.  further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s.  mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.

AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

AB  == gram-positive streptococcal mutans-like strains, but with clearly different colony formation than s. orisuis on mitis salivarius agar, were isolated from the pig oral cavity and identified by 16s rrna sequencing, g+c content, dna-dna homology and extensive biochemical and serological testing. the phenotypic data showed that the strains were similar to s. orisuis except for susceptibility to bacitracin. dna-dna homology between the isolates and s. orisuis was 72~81%. however, serological data showed that they have a different sero-specific antigen from s. orisuis and other mutans streptococci. a new serotype, designated p, strains are classified in a serovar of s. orisuis, one of mutans streptococci.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == new culture media for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus in  the saliva of head- and neck-irradiated patients.
AB  == the reduction in salivary flow in patients subjected to head and neck irradiation induces changes in the oral microflora and increases the risk of oral mucosal infections. the frequent presence of fungi, particularly candida, in the oral environment of these patients complicates identification of the most important cariogenic bacteria with the commercial crt bacteria (ivoclar vivadent) culture media. such identification is important for the application of chemical measures  to control cariogenic bacteria in these patients, since it has been shown that simple fluoride application is unable to control caries in this population. objective: the aim of this study was to obtain a simple medium that inhibits candida spp. growth and allows the specific growth of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. thus, reliable counts of cariogenic species can be achieved. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples from 30 head- and neck-radiotherapy patients were seeded in commercial crt bacteria culture medium  and in two different media designed by our group: mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba), containing 5% potassium tellurite and fluconazole 64 microg/ml (msbtpf) for the isolation of streptococcus; and man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar, containing bacitracin 0.2 u/ml and fluconazole 32 microg/ml (mrsbf) for the isolation of lactobacillus spp. results: candida growth was inhibited 100% in the media developed in this study. in all the samples seeded, growing of colonies in  mrsbf was identified as lactobacillus, while in crt bacteria for lactobacillus spp. this species was only isolated in 48.1% of the samples. s. mutans was identified in 71.4% of the colonies that grown in msbtpf medium, while in crt bacteria for s. mutans, this species was only identified in 35% of the colonies obtained. conclusion: the culture medium developed in the present study was able  to inhibit the 100% of candida spp. growth. these new media permit reliable counts of cariogenic bacteria in irradiated patients.

TI  == antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

TI  == inhibitory activity of garlic (allium sativum) extract on multidrug-resistant streptococcus mutans.
AB  == garlic (allium sativum) extract has been known to have inhibitory activity on various pathogenic bacteria, viruses and fungi. the objective of present investigation was to study in vitro inhibitory activity of garlic extract on multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of streptococcus mutans isolated from human carious teeth. filter sterilized aqueous extract of garlic was prepared and used  in the present study. for isolation of s. mutans, extracted human carious teeth were cultured in todd-hewit broth and mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. s. mutans was characterized by colony morphology, biochemical tests and other conventional  bacteriological procedures. disk sensitivity tests and broth dilution methods were used to determine antibiotic sensitivity profile and inhibitory activity of  garlic extract on s. mutans isolated from carious teeth. of 105 carious teeth tested, 92 (87.6%) isolates of s. mutans were recovered, among which 28 (30.4%) were mdr since they were resistant to four or more antibiotics. the highest rate  of resistance was observed for tetracycline (30.4%) and least resistance (0%) to  teichoplanin and vancomycin while 22.8% and 23.9% of the isolates were resistant  to penicillin and amoxicillin, respectively. chlorhexidine minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for mdr and non-mdr s. mutans varied from 2 to 16 microg ml(-1) and from 0.25 to 1 microg ml(-1), respectively (p<0.05). all isolates, mdr and non-mdr of s. mutans were sensitive to garlic extract with the mic ranging from 4 to 32 microg ml(-1). considering in vitro data obtained in the present study, mouthwashes or toothpaste containing optimum concentration of garlic extract could be used for prevention of dental caries.

AB  == four lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus paraplantarum km, enterococcus durans kh, streptococcus salivarius hm and weissella confusa jy, were isolated from humans and tested for their capabilities of converting isoflavone glucosides to aglycones in soymilk. changes in growth, ph, and titratable acidity (ta) were  investigated during fermentation at 37 degrees c for 12 h. after 6 to 9 h of fermentation, each population of 4 lab reached 10(8) to 10(9) cfu/ml. the initial ph of 6.3 +/- 0.1 decreased while the ta of 0.13%+/- 0.01% increased as fermentation proceeded, resulting in the final range between 4.1 +/- 0.2 and 4.6  +/- 0.1 for ph and between 0.51%+/- 0.02% and 0.67%+/- 0.06% for ta after the 12  h of fermentation. the glucoside concentrations were significantly decreased in soymilks fermented with either l. paraplantarum km, s. salivarius hm, or w. confusa jy with fermentation time (p < 0.05). l. paraplantarum km was the best in percent conversion of glucosides to corresponding aglycones, resulting in 100%, 90%, and 61% hydrolysis of genistin, daidzin, and glycitin, respectively, in 6 h. consequently, the aglycone concentrations in soymilk fermented with l. paraplantarum km were 6 and 7-fold higher than the initial levels of daidzein and genistein, respectively, after 6 h of fermentation. changes in the daidzin and genistin levels were not significant in soymilk fermented with e. durans kh. the  rates of hydrolysis of glucosides varied depending on the species of lab. especially, l. paraplantarum km seems to be a promising starter for bioactive-fermented soymilk based on its growth, acid production, and isoflavone  conversion within a short time.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the mutans streptococci from the dental plaques in koreans.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been implicated as cariogenic bacteria in dental caries  because they can produce high levels of dental caries-causing lactic acid and extracellular polysaccharide. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the mutans streptococci from the dental plaque obtained from koreans. the dental plaque samples were collected from the anterior and molar teeth of both jaws in 155 subjects (aged 2 to 33.2 years, average age 13.7+/-4.7  years). the samples were diluted by 100-fold in 1x pbs and plated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the mutans streptococci grown on msb plates were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) targeting dextranase gene (dex). the mutans streptococci  were identified at the species level using a 16s rdna sequencing comparison method. the biochemical tests were carried out to biotype the mutans streptococci. ninety-five strains of the mutans streptococci out of 358 colonies, which were derived from 141 subjects, were isolated. of them, 77 strains and 18 strains were streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, respectively. the biotyping data showed that 62, 1, 20, 10, and 2 strains were biotypes i, ii, iv,  v and variant, respectively. of the two strains of variant biotype, one strains was similar to biotype iv except that it was positive to the arginine hydrolysis  test. we considered this one strain a new biotype, and classified it as biotype vii. in conclusion, s. mutans and its biotype i was most frequently isolated in korean dental plaque. the mutans streptococci strains isolated in this study might be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and the prevention of dental caries.

TI  == bacteria interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization.
AB  == it is known that beneficial bacteria can suppress the emergence of pathogenic bacteria, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. this study examined the potential for a similar suppression of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus)  actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells, due to its potential relevance in periodontal diseases. seven presumed beneficial bacteria were examined for their ability to interfere, exclude, or displace a. actinomycetemcomitans from epithelial cells in vitro. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius showed prominent inhibitory effects on either a. actinomycetemcomitans recovery or colonization. these results confirmed the hypothesis that bacterial interactions interfere with a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells in vitro, and demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguinis.

TI  == rapid identification of viridans streptococci by mass spectrometric discrimination.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are responsible for several systemic diseases, such as endocarditis, abscesses, and septicemia. unfortunately, species identification by conventional methods seems to be more difficult than species identification of other groups of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) for the rapid identification of 10 different species of vs. a total of 99 vs clinical isolates, 10 reference strains, and 20 strains from our in-house culture collection were analyzed by maldi-tof-ms. to evaluate the mass-spectrometric discrimination results, all strains were identified in parallel by phenotypic and genotypic methods. maldi-tof-ms identified 71 isolates as the mitis group, 23 as the anginosus group, and 5 as streptococcus salivarius. comparison of the species identification results obtained by the maldi-tof-ms analyses and with the phenotypic/genotypic identification systems showed 100% consistency at the species level. thus, maldi-tof-ms seems to be a rapid and reliable method for the identification of species of vs from clinical samples.

TI  == production of gamma-aminobutyric acid by streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus y2 under submerged fermentation.
AB  == gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, has several well-known physiological functions and has been applied to the production of many drugs and functional foods. the technology of gaba production via submerged fermentation by streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus y2 was investigated in this paper. it indicated that the gaba production was related to the biochemical characteristics of glutamate decarboxylase (gad) of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus y2. after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c, which is the suitable culture conditions for gad-production, then the culture condition were adjusted to the optimal temperature (40 degrees c) and ph (4.5) for the gad reaction activity in biotransformation of cells and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (0.02 mmol/l) were added to the broth at the 48 h, the gaba production was increased up to 1.76-fold, reaching 7984.75 +/- 293.33 mg/l. the strain shows great potential use as a starter for gaba-containing yoghurt, cheese and other functional fermented food productions.

TI  == identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == synthesis and characterization of surface-grafted polyacrylamide brushes and their inhibition of microbial adhesion.
AB  == a method is presented to prevent microbial adhesion to solid surfaces exploiting  the unique properties of polymer brushes. polyacrylamide (paam) brushes were grown from silicon wafers by atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp) using a  three-step reaction procedure consisting of immobilization of a coupling agent gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, anchoring of an atrp initiator 4-(chloromethyl)benzoyl chloride, and controlled radical polymerization of acrylamide. the surfaces were characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and contact-angle measurements. the calculated grafting density pointed to the presence of a dense  and homogeneous polymer brush. initial deposition rates, adhesion after 4 h, and  detachment of two bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600 and streptococcus salivarius gb 24/9) and one yeast strain (candida albicans gb 1/2)  to both paam-coated and untreated silicon surfaces were investigated in a parallel plate flow chamber. a high reduction (70-92%) in microbial adhesion to the surface-grafted paam brush was observed, as compared with untreated silicon surfaces. application of the proposed grafting method to silicone rubbers may offer great potential to prevent biomaterials-centered infection of implants.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of nanocrystalline tetracalcium phosphate cements.
AB  == the antimicrobial properties of cements prepared from mechanically activated tetracalcium phosphate (mattcp) were tested with the agar diffusion test using streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus epidermidis, and a clinically isolated plaque mixture. all mattcp cements showed a significantly higher antimicrobial potency as revealed by inhibition zones of approximately 3-5 mm width, compared with a commercial ca(oh)(2)//salicylate cement which only produced small inhibition zones around the cement specimens of 1.5 mm or less. this behavior was explained by the formation of amorphous ca(oh)(2) during setting of mattcp cements, which is thought to have a higher solubility and may release more oh(-)  ions than conventional ca(oh)(2)//salicylate cements. in fact, the ph value in the agar gel around the specimens was higher in the case of mattcp cements (7.8-8.7) compared with the ca(oh)(2)//salicylate control (7.0-8.0). the mattcp cements did not affect the photoactivation of resin-based composites, and their antimicrobial activity is making them interesting candidates for the use as pulp-capping agents, endodontic sealers, or cavity liners in dentistry.

TI  == distribution and persistence of probiotic streptococcus salivarius k12 in the human oral cavity as determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the bacteriocin producer streptococcus salivarius k12 is used as a probiotic targeting the oral cavity, so our study aimed to assess whether its dispersal and persistence could be monitored using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. to this end, we designed polymerase chain reaction primers and a hybridization probe specifically targeting sala, which encodes for the prepropeptide of salivaricin a. using a single individual as our subject, we administered four lozenges of k12 throat guard per day over 3 days, then measured sala gene levels for 16 different oral sites at six different intervals over 35 days. four samples each from gingival sulci and from teeth all remained negative. in contrast, in saliva and at all mucosal membranes k12 was detected, but with varying amounts and time profiles. relatively high sala gene copy numbers, calibrated on the basis of colony-forming units, were seen on the tongue (maximum 4.6 x 10(4)/swab at day 4), in stimulated saliva (2.4 x 10(4)/ml, day 4) and on buccal membranes (1.3 x 10(4)/swab, day 8). k12 was present on both sides of the  pharynx but asymmetrically in both quantity and duration. in conclusion, we have  developed a real-time quantitative-polymerase chain reaction for counting s. salivarius k12 at various sites in the oral cavity. in the individual studied, k12 could be detected at the mucosal membranes for as long as 3 weeks, but with steadily decreasing numbers after day 8. thus, k12 may have the potential to control oral bacterial infections only when the uptake is repeated frequently.

TI  == urea transport in bacteria: acid acclimation by gastric helicobacter spp.
AB  == urea transporters in bacteria are relatively rare. there are three classes, the abc transporters such as those expressed by cyanobacteria and corynebacterium glutamicum, the yut protein expressed by yersinia spp and the urei expressed by gastric helicobacter spp. this review focuses largely on the urei proton-gated channel that is part of the acid acclimation mechanism essential for gastric colonization by the latter. urei is a six-transmembrane polytopic integral membrane protein, n and c termini periplasmic, and is expressed in all gastric helicobacter spp that have been studied but also in helicobacter hepaticus and streptococcus salivarius. the first two are proton-gated, the latter is ph insensitive. site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric constructs have identified histidines and dicarboxylic amino acids in the second periplasmic loop of h. pylori and the first loop of h. hepaticus urei and the c terminus of both as involved in a hydrogen-bonding dependence of proton gating, with the membrane domain in these but not in the urei of s. salivarius responding to the periplasmic conformational changes. urei and urease are essential for gastric colonization and urease associates with urei during acid exposure, facilitating activation of the urea and ureb apoenzyme complex by ni2+ insertion by the uref-ureh and uree-ureg assembly proteins. transcriptome analysis of acid responses of h. pylori also identified a cytoplasmic and periplasmic carbonic anhydrase as responding specifically to changes in periplasmic ph and these have  been shown to be essential also for acid acclimation. the finding also of upregulation of the two-component histidine kinase hp0165 and its response element hp0166, illustrates the complexity of the acid acclimation processes involved in gastric colonization by this pathogen.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibodies against streptococcus mutans antigens.
AB  == several studies have been conducted in the last decades aiming to obtain an anti-caries vaccine, however some studies have demonstrated cross reactivity between streptococcus mutans surface antigens and the human cardiac tissue. in this work, the reactivity of five anti-streptococcus mutans monoclonal antibodies (moab) (24a, 56g, c8, e8 and f6) was tested against oral streptococci, cardiac antigens and skeletal and cardiac myosins, aiming to evaluate the specificity of  these moab. the hybrid producers of immunoglobulins of the igg2b class were cloned by limit dilution and expanded in vivo. moab were tested by elisa. the hybrid 24a reacted with s. mutans cct 1910, s. salivarius cct 0365 and s. pyogenes t23. no reactivity difference was observed among the tested species. cross reactivity with heart and cardiac myosin was not confirmed and only reaction with myosin of skeletal muscle was observed (p = 0.0381). the hybrid 56g reacted with all the tested microorganisms and there was statistically significant difference between s. mutans and s. pyogenes t23 (p < 0.001). this hybrid also reacted with myosin of skeletal muscle (p = 0.0095). c8, e8 and f6 presented low reactivity against oral streptococci strains and no reactivity against cardiac antigens. the data of this study showed that the 24a and 56g anti-s. mutans moab presented reactivity with s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, reinforcing the occurrence of common antigens between these species. the tested moab presented low cross-reactivity with myosin of skeletal muscle, but anti-heart activity could not be confirmed.

TI  == evaluation of piper cubeba extract, (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == the activities of the crude ethanol extract from piper cubeba seeds, (-)-cubebin  and its semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated against oral pathogens. the crude ethanol extract was more active against streptococcus salivarius (mic value of 80 microg/ml). (-)-cubebin displayed mic values ranging from 0.20 mm for streptococcus mitis to 0.35 mm for enterococcus faecalis. the natural product (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivative (-)-hinokinin displayed bacteriostatic activity at all evaluated concentrations, as well as fungicidal activity against candida albicans at 0.28 mm. the o-benzyl cubebin derivative showed fungistatic and fungicidal effects against c. albicans at 0.28 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. also, the other dibenzylbutyrolactone derivatives [(-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin and (-)-o-(n,n-dimethylaminoethyl)-cubebin] displayed  bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects at the evaluated concentrations. moreover, the semi-synthetic derivative (-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin was the most active compound against all the evaluated microorganisms. therefore, it may be suggested that the presence of the carbonyl group at c-9 plus the introduction of polar groups in the aromatic rings improve the antimicrobial activity of dibenzylbutyrolactone compounds.

TI  == surface antibacterial properties of resin and resin-modified dental cements.
AB  == objective: cements possessing antibacterial properties may reduce bacteria-induced fixed partial denture complications. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial properties of 4 dental cements using the direct contact test (dct) and the agar diffusion test (adt). method and materials: the adt was performed using mitis salivarius agar plates. each plate was evenly inoculated with freshly grown mutans streptococci. two samples of each test material-relyx arc, variolink ii, gc fujicem, and principle-were placed, and the  inhibition halo obtained was measured after 48 hours. for the dct, 8 samples were placed on the sidewalls of wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. after polymerization, freshly grown streptococcus mutans cells (1 x 10(6)) were placed  on the surface of each sample for 1 hour at 37 degrees c. fresh medium was then added to each well, and bacterial growth was followed for 16 hours in a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer. similarly prepared samples were aged in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 or 7 days and the dct was repeated. analysis of variance (anova) and tukey multiple comparisons were applied to the data. results: in the adt, gc fujicem showed an inhibition zone of 2.0 +/- 0.3 mm, and  principle showed an inhibition zone of 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm. in the dct, freshly polymerized samples of gc fujicem and principle exhibited potent antibacterial properties, while samples of variolink ii and relyx arc showed moderate antibacterial properties. principle showed some antibacterial properties even after 1 day (p < .001). conclusion: none of the tested cements in this study possesses long-term antibacterial properties.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effect of calcium hydroxide protection in indirect pulp capping in primary teeth.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effect of calcium hydroxide (ch) on carious dentin on primary teeth submitted to indirect pulp capping (ipc). methods: twenty 4-7 year-old subjects with 42 treated teeth participated in the study. the treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of a ch or gutta-percha (gp) layer and sealing with a resin-based composite for 4-7 months. after cavity preparation and sealing, the dentin was evaluated clinically (color and consistency) and microbiologically. dentin samples were cultured on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar and rogosa sl agar. results: 39 teeth (20 in the ch group and 19 in the gp group) were reopened 4-7 months post-treatment for clinical and microbiological evaluation. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was wet and soft or leathery. in the ch group, 10% of the lesions were yellow, 80% light brown and 10% dark brown and in the gp group, 94.7% were light brown and 5.3% dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, 90% (group ch) and 84.2% (group gp) were dark brown. the final consistency was either leathery or hard. three samples in the ch group and five in group gp changed from soft to leathery; only one sample (gp) remained leathery. 85% in the ch group and 68.4% in gp group turned hard after treatment.  all bacterial counts decreased significantly by the end of treatment. in the ch group, the bacterial (log10 cfu + 1) anaerobic growth decreased from 4.84 +/- 1.31 to 1.35 +/- 1.54, aerobic from 4.09 +/- 1.04 to 0.92 +/- 1.30 and lactobacilli from 3.24 +/- 1.22 to 0.36 +/- 0.89, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 2.05 +/- 1.84 to 0.14 +/- 0.60. in gp group, anaerobic growth decreased from 5.22 +/- 0.96 to 2.02 +/- 1.65 and aerobic from 4.23 +/- 1.37 to 1.08 +/- 1.29 and lactobacilli from 2.06 +/- 1.81 to 0.00 +/- 0.00, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 3.16 +/- 1.59 to 0.28 +/- 0.84.

TI  == comparative analysis of a monoclonal antibody-based streptococcus mutans detection method with selective culture assays using polymerase chain reaction as a gold standard.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare a recently developed monoclonal antibody (mab)-based salivary streptococcus mutans detection method with various selective media using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as the gold standard. salivary s. mutans cells were enumerated with a mab-based method, along with three commonly used selective media, mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb), trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin agar (tycsb), and glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) agar. statistical analysis  showed no significant correlations between each method. with pcr as the standard, a mab-based detection method was found to provide the highest sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%) among these four methods. this study demonstrates that the  mab-based detection method may provide more accurate enumeration of salivary s. mutans than selective media.

TI  == salivaricin a2 and the novel lantibiotic salivaricin b are encoded at adjacent loci on a 190-kilobase transmissible megaplasmid in the oral probiotic strain streptococcus salivarius k12.
AB  == the commercial probiotic streptococcus salivarius strain k12 is the prototype of  those s. salivarius strains that are the most strongly inhibitory in a standardized test of streptococcal bacteriocin production and has been shown to produce the 2,368-da salivaricin a2 (sala2) and the 2,740-da salivaricin b (sbob) lantibiotics. the previously uncharacterized sbob belongs to the type aii class of lantibiotic bacteriocins and is encoded by an eight-gene cluster. the genetic  loci encoding sala2 and sbob in strain k12 have been fully characterized and are  localized to nearly adjacent sites on pssal-k12, a 190-kb megaplasmid. of 61 strongly inhibitory strains of s. salivarius, 19 (31%) were positive for the sbob structural gene. all but one (strain nr) of these 19 strains were also positive for sala2, and in each of these cases of double positivity, the two loci were separated by fewer than 10 kb. this is the first report of a single streptococcus strain producing two distinct lantibiotics.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria and other gut bacteria in pigs by a macroarraying method.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) consist of many genera, gram-positive, and nonspore-forming micro-organisms; some members being used as probiotics while some others have negative effects on pig health. bacterial species in the gastrointestinal tract can produce antibacterial substances, reduce serum cholesterol in their host, or can be responsible for growth reduction, diarrhea,  and intestinal epithelial damage. it is therefore important for the pig industry  to evaluate the impact of food and farm management on the presence of "good" or "bad" bacteria and the risk for consumers. this articles focuses on the molecular identification of gut microflora species following different diets given to pigs  in uk and correlating the data on growth, health, and welfare. first of all, pig  feces were individually collected from sows before and after farrowing and also from piglets before and after weaning over several months. bacteria colonies were grown on mrs agar plates from feces and dna was extracted (qiaamp dna stool kit)  and amplified using 16s rdna (27f and 519r) primers. dna sequencing and sequence  alignment allowed us to identify species-specific zones, which were used as probes in a macroarray system also known as reverse line blot hybridization. some probes were found to be species specific for the following species: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. animalis, l. gallinarum, l. kitasanotis, l salivarius, streptococcus alactolyticus, s. hyointestinalis, and sarcina ventriculi. actual studies are now focusing on the impact of diets of the microflora in different gut parts and at different stages of the animal's life.

TI  == a modified dip-slide test for microbiological risk in caries assessment.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the validity of a new modified dip-slide test kit for the estimation of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels by comparison with the results obtained from conventional agar plate counts. five milliliters of paraffin-stimulated saliva sample was collected from 118 6-12-year old children attending 4 primary schools in thailand. saliva was poured over a 3-compartment slide containing mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar, rogosa agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. a slide was incubated in a 5% co2  incubator for 48 hours. the results of the modified test kit were compared with those from the conventional saliva sampling with dilution method. the salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida counts obtained from the conventional methods were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the modified dip-slide estimates of these organisms. (kendall tau = 0.71, 0.58 and 0.76, respectively). the correlation between a modified dip-slide test kit and the conventional method indicates that this new test kit is suitable for the screening of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels in patients. the test is simple and would be useful for the early selection of patients for dental examination. in addition, it would be a valuable educational  aid for the motivation and dietary counseling among children.

TI  == antibiotic resistances of starter and probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the antibiotic resistances of 45 lactic acid bacteria strains belonging to the genera lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus, pediococcus, and leuconostoc were investigated. the objective was to determine antibiotic resistances and to verify these at the genetic level, as is currently suggested by the european "qualified presumption of safety" safety evaluation system for industrial starter strains. in addition, we sought to pinpoint possible problems in resistance determinations. primers were used to pcr amplify genes involved in beta-lactam antibiotic, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin resistance. the presence of ribosomal protection protein genes and the ermb gene was also determined by using a gene probe. generally, the incidences of erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, or beta-lactam resistances in this study were low  (<7%). in contrast, aminoglycoside (gentamicin and streptomycin) and ciprofloxacin resistances were higher than 70%, indicating that these may constitute intrinsic resistances. the genetic basis for ciprofloxacin resistance  could not be verified, since no mutations typical of quinolone resistances were detected in the quinolone determining regions of the parc and gyra genes. some starter strains showed low-level ampicillin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline resistances, but no known resistance genes could be detected. although some strains possessed the cat gene, none of these were phenotypically resistant to chloramphenicol. using reverse transcription-pcr, these cat genes were shown to be silent under both inducing and noninducing conditions. only lactobacillus salivarius bfe 7441 possessed an ermb gene, which was encoded on the chromosome and which could not be transferred in filter-mating experiments. this study clearly demonstrates problems encountered with resistance testing, in  that the breakpoint values are often inadequately identified, resistance genes may be present but silent, and the genetic basis and associated resistance mechanisms toward some antibiotics are still unknown.

TI  == calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. here, the adhesion  of streptococcus mutans and 3 different lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with ca2+ concentration. the effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. adhesion of lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of streptococcus mutans at low ca2+) was enhanced with increasing ca2+ concentration. lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. the results are interpreted in terms of ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).

TI  == extent of horizontal gene transfer in evolution of streptococci of the salivarius group.
AB  == the phylogenetically closely related species streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis are oral bacteria that are considered commensals, although they can also be found in human infections. the relationship between these two species and the relationship between strains isolated from carriers and strains responsible for invasive infections were investigated by multilocus sequence typing and additional sequence analysis. the clustering of several s. vestibularis alleles and the extent of genomic divergence at certain loci support the conclusion that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis are separate species. the level of sequence diversity in s. salivarius alleles is generally high, whereas that in s. vestibularis alleles is low at certain loci, indicating that the latter species might have evolved recently. cluster analysis indicated that there has been genetic exchange between s. salivarius and s. vestibularis at three of the nine loci investigated. horizontal gene transfer between streptococci belonging to the s. salivarius group and other oral streptococci was also detected at several loci. a high level of recombination in s. salivarius was revealed by allele index association and split decomposition sequence analyses. commensal and infection-associated s. salivarius strains could not be distinguished by cluster analysis, suggesting that the pathogen isolates are opportunistic. taken together, our results indicate that there is a high level of gene exchange that contributes to the evolution of two streptococcal species from the human oral cavity.

AB  == to obtain primary idea on oral bacterium species that are generally present in periodotally healthy koreans, the oral bacterial flora in the saliva of four periodontally healthy koreans at different ages (5, 32, 35, 65) was investigated  in this study. for this investigation, 16srrna gene clone libraries were generated from the saliva of the four healthy koreans, and 50 clones were randomly selected from each saliva clone library and sequenced. totally, 37 different kinds of bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were identified based on sequence homology search through genbank database. the 37 kinds of saliva clone sequences were classified to 14 genera and 2 uncultured and 1 unidentified bacteria. among the 14 identified genera, streptococcus, prevotella, and veillonella were common genera, and streptococcus was dominant genus that accounted for 7 different species. among the seven streptococcus species, s. salivarius appeared as the most common species. more numbers of species belonging to the genera streptococcus and prevotella was present in saliva from ages 32 and 35. while saliva from ages 5 and 65 showed more numbers of species belonging to the genera rothia, including potential pathogenic species. overall, saliva of a young child and a senior showed higher bacterial diversity than that of young adults.

TI  == the effect of ingestion of milk supplemented with salivaricin a-producing streptococcus salivarius on the bacteriocin-like inhibitory activity of streptococcal populations on the tongue.
AB  == the colonization efficacies of salivaricin a (sala)-producing streptococcus salivarius strains 20p3 and 5 were compared when given in milk to 219 children, using either 2-day or 9-day dosing regimens. colonization levels overall were superior for strain 5, and the 9-day dosing schedule resulted in higher levels of both initial colonization and strain persistence. the indigenous streptococcal tongue populations of 20 (10.9%) of the 189 children in the 2-day trial showed markedly increased sala-like inhibitory activity following use of the s. salivarius-supplemented milk. all 20 of these children were found to have had relatively small (<5% of total s. salivarius) indigenous tongue populations of sala-producing s. salivarius, and the relative proportions and/or inhibitory activity of these sala producers on the childrens' tongues increased following ingestion of the s. salivarius-supplemented milk. because sala is known to be strongly inhibitory to streptococcus pyogenes, an important implication of this study is that the consumption of sala-producing probiotic s. salivarius could potentially help to effect a sustained increase in sala-mediated protection against s. pyogenes infection.

TI  == influence of a fluoride mouthrinse on mutans streptococci in schoolchildren.
AB  == this study aimed to determine whether the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse  affects the salivary levels of mutans streptococci. two hundred and fifteen schoolchildren (aged 9-10 years) participated. one hundred and forty-nine of these children had used a fluoride mouthrinse since 5 years of age at nursery school, and the remaining 66 children had not. dft (decayed and filled teeth) was recorded, and the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were measured using mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. the group that had used a fluoride mouthrinse had a significantly lower prevalence of both s. mutans and s. sobrinus (p = 0.038) and a significantly lower dft score (p < 0.001) than  the other group. using logistic regression analysis including caries experience at baseline as a dependent variable, the odds ratio of carrying s. mutans alone was 8.0 (p = 0.066) and that of carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was 16.5  (p = 0.022) in the group that had not used the fluoride mouthrinse. children carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus had a higher caries incidence in 1 year than the others, with odds ratios of 5.73 (p = 0.067) in the group with a fluoride mouthrinse and 3.47 (p = 0.035) in the group without it. these results show that the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse is associated with reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci and this bacterial reduction may partly contribute to the suppression of dental caries in children using a long-term fluoride mouthrinse.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius promotes mucin putrefaction and malodor production by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == although the contribution of the oral microbiota to oral malodor is well-documented, the potential role of gram-positive micro-organisms is unclear.  in the current study, we tested the hypothesis that gram-positive micro-organisms contribute to malodor production by deglycosylating oral glycoproteins, rendering them susceptible to subsequent proteolysis. to this end, we examined the effect of streptococcus salivarius on porphyromonas gingivalis-mediated putrefaction of  a model glycoprotein (pig gastric mucin). malodor was scored by two odor judges,  and volatile sulfides were determined with the use of a sulfide monitor. mucin degradation was followed by electrophoresis on sds-page. results showed that the  addition of s. salivarius or beta-galactosidase promoted mucin degradation and concomitant malodor production. addition of glycosidic inhibitors (p-aptg and glucose) inhibited this process. these results suggest that gram-positive micro-organisms such as s. salivarius contribute to oral malodor production by deglycosylating salivary glycoproteins, thus exposing their protein core to further degradation by gram-negative micro-organisms.

AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve and b. infantis) and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == megaplasmids encode differing combinations of lantibiotics in streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius strains commonly produce bacteriocins as putative anti-competitor or signalling molecules. here we report that bacteriocin production by the oral probiotic strain s. salivarius k12 is encoded by a large (ca. 190 kb) plasmid. oral cavity transmission of the plasmid from strain k12 to  a plasmid-negative variant of this bacterium was demonstrated in two subjects. tests of additional s. salivarius strains showed large (up to ca. 220 kb) plasmids present in bacteriocin-producing isolates. various combinations (up to 3 per plasmid) of loci encoding the known streptococcal lantibiotics salivaricin a, salivaricin b, streptin and sa-ff22 were localised to these plasmids. since all bacteriocin-producing strains of s. salivarius tested to date appear to harbour plasmids, it appears that they may function as mobile repositories for bacteriocin loci, especially those of the lantibiotic class.

AB  == evidence suggests a trend for a higher fecal carriage rate of streptococcus bovis in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). this study defines the fecal carriage rate of s. bovis among children with ibd compared to controls. subjects with ibd were prospectively enrolled from the patient population of a pediatric gastroenterology practice. stool samples from ibd patients as well as controls were analyzed within 24 hr for the presence of s. bovis. the study enrolled 47 patients with ibd and 34 controls. among the 47 ibd patients, 3 had a positive stool culture for s. bovis (6%) and 1 had an equivocal result between s. bovis and s. salivarius. including this equivocal result, 8.5% of ibd patients were s. bovis carriers. among the 34 controls, 3 (9%) were found to be fecal carriers of s. bovis. assuming that the equivocal stool was indeed s. bovis, these groups are not statistically different as determined by fisher's exact test (p=0.6). we conclude that the fecal carriage rate of s. bovis is not increased among pediatric patients with ibd compared with controls.

TI  == acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == alcohol is a well documented risk factor for upper digestive tract cancers. it has been shown that acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol is carcinogenic. the role of microbes in the production of acetaldehyde to the oral  cavity has previously been described in several studies. in the present study, the aim was to investigate the capability of viridans group streptococci of normal oral flora to produce acetaldehyde in vitro during ethanol incubation. furthermore, the aim was to measure the alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) activity of the bacteria. eight clinical strains and eight american type culture collection (atcc) strains of viridans group streptococci were selected for the study. bacterial suspensions were incubated in two different ethanol concentrations, 11  mm and 1100 mm and the acetaldehyde was measured by gas chromatography. adh-activity was measured by using a sensitive spectroscopy. the results show significant differences between the bacterial strains regarding acetaldehyde production capability and the detected adh-activity. in particular, clinical strain of streptococcus salivarius, both clinical and culture collection strains  of streptococcus intermedius and culture collection strain of streptococcus mitis produced high amounts of acetaldehyde in 11 mm and 1100 mm ethanol incubation. all these four bacterial strains also showed significant adh-enzyme activity. twelve other strains were found to be low acetaldehyde producers. consequently, our study shows that viridans group streptococci may play a role in metabolizing  ethanol to carcinogenic acetaldehyde in the mouth. the observation supports the concept of a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of oral cancer.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == unusual asymptomatic giant sialolith of the submandibular gland: a clinical report.
AB  == this report presents an unusual case of asymptomatic sialolith of the submandibular gland. a 61-year-old man was referred to our department for multiple extractions. an ortopantomographic exam revealed the existence of a large radiopacity in the right premolar mandibular region. the patient was completely asymptomatic and no episodes of pain and swelling had occurred in the  previous years. ultrasonography and clinical examination confirmed the diagnosis  of sialolithiasis of the submandibular duct. the calculus was removed trans-orally in local anaesthesia. the sialolith measured 22 mm and it was mainly constituted by phosphate, calcium and smaller amounts of magnesium. the bacteriological exam revealed the presence of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus  salivarius and non-pathogenic neisserie. postoperative course was uneventful. even a sialolith of significant dimensions may not be symptomatic. nevertheless,  the likelihood of future complications may constitute an indication for surgical  removal of abnormal asymptomatic sialoliths.

TI  == synthesis of hpr(ser-p)(his-p) by enzyme i of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system of streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == hpr is a protein of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). in gram-positive bacteria, hpr can be phosphorylated on ser(46) by hpr(ser) kinase/phosphorylase (hprk/p) and on his(15) by enzyme i (ei) of the pts. in vitro studies have shown that phosphorylation on one residue greatly inhibits the second phosphorylation. however, streptococci contain significant amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p) during exponential growth, and recent studies suggest that phosphorylation of hpr(ser-p) by ei is involved in the recycling of hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p). we report in this paper a study on the phosphorylation of streptococcus salivarius hpr, hpr(ser-p), and hpr(s46d) by ei. our results indicate that (i) the specificity constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of ei for hpr(ser-p) at ph 7.9 was approximately 5000-fold smaller  than that observed for hpr, (ii) no metabolic intermediates were able to stimulate hpr(ser-p) phosphorylation, (iii) the rate of hpr phosphorylation decreased at phs below 6.5, while that of hpr(ser-p) increased and was almost 10-fold higher at ph 6.1 than at ph 7.9, (iv) hpr(s46d), a mutated hpr alleged to mimic hpr(ser-p), was also phosphorylated more efficiently under acidic conditions, and, lastly, (v) phosphorylation of bacillus subtilis hpr(ser-p) by b. subtilis ei was also stimulated at acidic ph. our results suggest that the high levels of hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p) in streptococci result from the combination of two factors, a high physiological concentration of hpr(ser-p) and  stimulation of hpr(ser-p) phosphorylation by ei at acidic ph, an intracellular condition that occurs in response to the acidification of the external medium during growth of the culture.

TI  == comparison of culture media and chairside assays for enumerating mutans streptococci.
AB  == aim: this study compared several traditional culture-based media and chairside cultural assays for ability to recover mutans streptococci (ms) from pure cultures and from saliva samples. methods and results: when pure cultures were used with traditional culture-based media, mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar demonstrated less support for bacterial recovery than trypticase-yeast extract-cysteine sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agar and the modified medium of ritz  (hlr-s). one species of ms, streptococcus ferus (c), was not recovered on msb medium. chairside cultural tests displayed considerable disparity between tests in recovering bacteria from pure cultures. on the glass adherence assay (mucount), s. ferus was not detected and streptococcus criceti was not detected on the dipslide assay (cariescreen sm) or on the plastic adherence assay (dentocult sm strip mutans). the frequency of isolation of pure strains of bacteria other than ms was common. from saliva samples, the frequency of isolation of ms on hlr-s and tycsb media and the glass adherence assay was 91-97%. the frequency of isolation on msb medium and on the dip-slide and plastic adherence assays was significantly decreased (37, 47 and 69%, respectively). recovery scores varied considerably among the culture methods studied and tended  to be highest on the hlr-s medium and on the glass adherence assay. conclusions:  growth and recovery profiles of pure bacterial cultures and of saliva samples for the ms varied according to different media. significance and impact of the study: caution should be exercised in comparing results between studies that employ different cultural methods for ms enumeration.

TI  == a lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterise streptococcus mutans from irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by lactococcus lactis dpc3147. methods and results: saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on mitis salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. following selective plating, 16s rdna sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), 15 distinct strains of strep. mutans were identified. these were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, lactococcus  lactis ssp. lactis hp. inhibition of indicator strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate  assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. the concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 au ml(-1). concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of strep. mutans strains in broth. moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 au ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. conclusion: a food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral strep. mutans. significance and impact of the study: the inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.

TI  == early acquisition of streptococcus mutans for children.
AB  == existing evidence reveals that in early oral infection the main route of transmission of streptococcus mutans is mother-child saliva contacts and that initial acquisition takes place during a specific period of time denominated "window of infectivity" that lapses between 6 and 30 months of the child's life,  with a higher risk between 18 and 30 months of age. the aim of the present study  was to analyze early oral infection. the levels of streptococcus mutans in saliva and bacterial plaque in the binomial mother-child 6 to 18 months after childbirth were evaluated. twenty-four mother-child binomials that attended the university hospital of maternity and neonatology of cordoba participated in the study. samples of saliva and dental plaque were taken from mother and child and seeded in selective agar mitis salivarius bacitracin medium (0.28 mg/ml) and cultured for 48 hours at 37 degrees c and in 5% co2 to allow for the growth of streptococcus mutans. the colonies were identified morphologically and biochemically. at 6 months after childbirth: 58.33% of the samples of the mother's saliva were positive, while the presence of the microorganism was not detected in 100% of the samples of the infants' saliva. at 18 months of after childbirth: 79.16% of the samples of saliva and 100% of the samples of the mothers' dental plaque were positive, whereas the samples of saliva and dental plaque of the infants were positive for streptococcus mutans in 20.83% and 70.83% of the cases respectively. the initial acquisition of streptococcus mutans would  have occurred in 20.8% of the children at the age of 18 months. eruption of primary molars occurs at this age.

TI  == effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by sonicare advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. methods: a wild strain of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius and veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. for each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. biofilms were divided into four groups and  were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. the distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. a colorimetric technique (mtt assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the  adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. results: anova results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of s. mutans  and s. salivarius adherent to the disks, while l. acidophilus and v. alcalescens  seemed to remain basically unaffected. in the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while s. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, s. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to sonicare.

AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

TI  == production of the lantibiotic salivaricin a and its variants by oral streptococci and use of a specific induction assay to detect their presence in human saliva.
AB  == salivaricin a (sala), the first streptococcus salivarius lantibiotic to be characterized, appears to be inhibitory to most streptococcus pyogenes strains. a variant of the sala structural gene (sala1) is present in more than 90% of s. pyogenes strains, but only strains of m serotype 4 and t pattern 4 produce the biologically active peptide. the present study identifies four additional variants (sala2 to sala5) of the sala structural gene and demonstrates that each  of the corresponding inhibitory peptides (sala2 to sala5) is produced in vitro. these variants appear to be similar to sala and sala1 in their inhibitory activity against micrococcus luteus and in their ability to act as inducers of sala production. it had previously been shown that s. pyogenes strain sf370 had a deletion (of approximately 2.5 kb) in the salm and salt genes of the sala1 locus. in the present study, several additional characteristic deletions within the sala1 loci were identified. s. pyogenes strains of the same m serotype all share  the same sala1 locus structure. since s. salivarius is a predominant member of the normal oral flora of healthy humans, strains producing anti-s. pyogenes lantibiotics, such as sala, may have excellent potential for use as oral probiotics. in the present study, we have used a highly specific sala induction system to directly detect the presence of sala in the saliva of humans who either naturally harbor populations of sala-producing s. salivarius or who have been colonized with the sala2-producing probiotic s. salivarius k12.

AB  == background and objective: dental caries is associated with oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) is one of the primary cariogenic organisms. mastic gum, from pistacia lentiscus, has been shown to have antibacterial properties. the objective of this study was to determine antibacterial activity of mastic chewing gum against s. mutans and mutans streptococci in vitro and in vivo conditions. setting: cukurova university, dental school, in 2002. materials  and methods: antimicrobial activity of mastic gum was evaluated using standard s. mutans strain by disc diffusion method in vitro. cytotoxicity effect of mastic gum on hep-2 cells was evaluated by conventional haemocytometer using the trypan  blue exclusion method. clinical studies were then performed on 25 periodontally healthy volunteers. the inhibitory effect of chewing mastic gum against mutans streptococci in saliva was compared to a placebo gum. saliva samples were taken from the subjects immediately before and after chewing the mastic gum and the placebo gum for 15 min. additional saliva samples were collected every 30 min. the samples were inoculated onto mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and incubated for 48 h anaerobically at 37 degrees c. the total number of viable bacteria was then counted. results: among tested solvents (chloroform, acetone, petrolium ether and ethanol), it was found that the acetone was found to be more convenient than the others to dissolve the mastic gum. in the cytotoxicity assay, concentrations up to 75 mg/ml of the mastic gum were not toxic for the replication of hep-2 cells. thus, lower concentrations of mastic gum (20 and 50 mg/ml) were used for the experiments. in vitro experiments, the diameters of growth inhibition zones of mastic gum were in the range 9.0-27.0 mm. in the clinical trials, the mean number of bacteria in samples taken after chewing the mastic gum and placebo gum were following; at minute 15 was 112 x 10(4)+/-268 x 10(3) and 175 x 10(4)+/-417 x 10(3)cfu/ml, for minute 45 was 85 x 10(4)+/-219 x 10(3) and 165 x 10(4)+/-329 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 75 was 65 x 10(4)+/-100 x 10(3) and 160 x 10(4)+/-216 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 105 was 60 x 10(4)+/-127 x 10(3) and 150 x 10(4)+/-138 x 10(3)cfu/ml, and at minute 135 was 55 x 10(4)+/-65  x 10(3) and 145 x 10(4)+/-354 x 10(3)cfu/ml, respectively. significantly fewer bacteria was found in saliva samples collected after chewing mastic gum compared  to those after chewing paraffin (p<0.001). conclusions: this preliminary study showed that mastic gum had significant antibacterial activity against s. mutans and mutans streptococci and it may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of caries.

TI  == identification of 43 streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpb gene.
AB  == pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  streptococcus genus. two variable regions in the rnpb gene, which encodes the rna subunit of endonuclease p, were sequenced in two reactions. of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs streptococcus anginosus/s. constellatus and s. infantis/s. peroris. a total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial  rnpb sequences. all but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpb database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. the identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems vitek 2 and rapid id 32 strep. the concordance between pyrosequencing and vitek 2 was 75%, and for rapid id 32 strep the corresponding figure was 77%. isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpb dna sequence analysis that confirmed  the identifications by pyrosequencing. in conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of  the rnpb gene can reliably identify streptococcus species with high resolution.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == high frequency of isolation of antibiotic-resistant oral viridans streptococci from children in kuwait.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance among the viridans group of streptococci (vgs) has emerged as a hindrance to effective antibiotic therapy. our objective was to evaluate the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant vgs in healthy children. plaque samples were collected from tooth and tongue surfaces of 102 healthy subjects. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto bhi agar plates and mitis salivarius agar (msa) plates and incubated as appropriate. representative colonies were identified to species level by standard methods. susceptibility of  the vgs was performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 11 antibiotics using etest. of the 540 vgs isolates from both sites, 58% were  from the tooth surfaces and 42% from the tongue. the most prevalent were s. salivarius (21.5%) and s. sanguis (16.3%). imipenem and vancomycin had excellent  activities. resistance rates to trimethoprim, amoxicillin, piperacillin, erythromycin, cefuroxime and cephalothin, were 60.7, 40.8, 34.7, 32.6, 27.5 and 25.3%, respectively. resistance rates to penicillin and clindamycin were 15.9% and 15.4%, respectively. the majority of the erythromycin-resistant isolates were from the tongue; 41% versus 29%. at the species level, 26% and 23% of s. salivarius and 23% and 14% of s. mutans from the tooth and tongue, respectively were resistant to penicillin. the data show species-related and site-related variations in the susceptibility pattern and an emerging high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant vgs. the difference in the susceptibilities between the species underscores the importance of accurate-identification and the need for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates in our hospitals.

TI  == analysis of the interfacial properties of fibrillated and nonfibrillated oral streptococcal strains from electrophoretic mobility and titration measurements: evidence for the shortcomings of the 'classical soft-particle approach'.
AB  == chemical and structural intricacies of bacterial cells complicate the quantitative evaluation of the physicochemical properties pertaining to the cell  surface. the presence of various types of cell surface appendages has a large impact on those properties and therefore on various interfacial phenomena, such as aggregation and adhesion. in this paper, an advanced analysis of the electrophoretic mobilities of fibrillated and nonfibrillated strains (streptococcus salivarius hb and streptococcus salivarius hb-c12, respectively) is performed over a wide range of ph and ionic strength conditions on the basis of a recent electrokinetic theory for soft particles. the latter extends the approximate formalism originally developed by ohshima by solving rigorously the fundamental electrokinetic equations without restrictions on the bacterial size,  charge, and double layer thickness. it further allows (i) a straightforward implementation of the dissociation characteristics, as evaluated from titration experiments, of the ionogenic charged groups distributed throughout the bacterial cell wall and/or the surrounding exopolymer layer and (ii) the inclusion of possible specific interactions between the charged groups and ions from the background electrolyte other than charge-determining ions. the theory also enables an estimation of possible swelling/shrinking processes operating on the outer polymeric layer of the bacterium. application of the electrokinetic model to hb and hb-c12 clearly shows a significant discrepancy between the amount of surface charges probed by electrophoresis and by protolytic titration. this is ascribed to the specific adsorption of cations onto pristine charged sites in the cell wall. physicochemical parameters pertaining to the hydrodynamics (softness degree) and electrostatics of the bacterial cell wall (hb-c12) and soft polymeric layer (hb) are quantitatively derived.

TI  == [comparison of galla chinesis and sodium fluoride on growth and metabolism of bacteria in biofilm model].
AB  == objective: to compare the antibacterial effect between sodium fluoride and galla  chinesis in bioflim model. to evaluate the feasibility of application of gala chinesis in the clinical practice of caries prevention. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii had been chosen as the experimental bacteria. in the experiment, biofilmn model was constructed, and two agents were added in the media. after a period of continuous culture, the number of bacteria adhering on the ha disc was  examed, the planktonic ph in the flow cell was recorded continuously, and the morphology of the biofilmn formed on the ha disc was observed by sem. results: (1) galla chinesis could inhibit the growth of the four oral bacteria in the biofilm just as sodium fluoride. (2) galla chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic ph in the flow cell, but galla chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) the biofilms formed after application of galla chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. conclusion: galla chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.

AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the formation of conjugated linoleic acid (cla), microbial growth, and organoleptic attributes (acidity, texture, and flavor) of fermented milk products was determined. four probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 56, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii 51, and p. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii 23, were evaluated individually or in coculture with traditional yogurt cultures  (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus). the lipid source was hydrolyzed soy oil. l. rhamnosus, in coculture with yogurt culture, resulted in the highest content of cla. growth and cla formation of propionibacteria were enhanced in the presence of yogurt cultures. texture and flavor attributes of fermented milks produced with propionibacteria were significantly different than the fermented milks processed  with yogurt cultures. the fermented milks processed with probiotic bacteria in coculture with yogurt cultures demonstrated similar acidity, texture, and flavor  as the fermented milk produced with yogurt cultures.

TI  == cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius in rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered to be non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic on the basis of long years of safe usage. however, some species of lactobacilli are thought to be associated with the development of dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to examine the cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius in rats. rats were divided into six groups, and infected with l. salivarius ls1952r and/or streptococcus mutans mt8148r. l. salivarius ls1952r became established in the oral cavity of rats and induced significant level of dental caries even when infected for only 5 days from 18 to 22 days of age. in addition, the caries scores of rats superinfected with both streptococcus mutans mt8148r and l. salivarius ls1952r from 18 days of age were significantly higher than those infected with either l. salivarius ls1952r or s. mutans mt8148r alone. since strain ls1952r can adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatites, it is concluded that  l. salivarius strain ls1952r possesses an inherent cariogenic activity following  adherence to the tooth surface.

TI  == microbial analysis of the autogenous bone collected by bone filter during oral surgery: a clinical study.
AB  == purpose: the purposes of the study presented are to identify the microbial content of the collected bone debris and to determine the antibacterial efficiency of chlorhexidine mouth rinse in reducing the microbial content of the  collected bone debris. patients and methods: twenty-five patients who had asymptomatic fully impacted mandibular third molars bilaterally underwent surgical removal for prophylactic and orthodontic considerations. immediately before surgery all patients rinsed with 10 ml of their assigned solution (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) for 2 minutes. before surgical removal of the teeth, bone debris was collected with a stringent aspiration protocol from the ramus by bone filter. the microbial content of the bone debris was assessed and the bacterial levels between the 2 groups were compared statistically. results: all samples from both groups (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) yielded viable microorganisms. there was no significant difference between the mean/median colony-forming units (cfu)/g values of both group samples, for aerobes (streptococcus salivarius) and anaerobes (bacteroides, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, and veillonella species). with regard to total microorganisms, the mean cfu/g derived from the chlorhexidine group samples were  1.5 x 10(8) cfu/g per bone sample compared with 1.5 x 10(9) cfu/g for the sterile saline control group (p < .05). conclusion: although chlorhexidine rinsing immediately before surgery reduced the levels of total microorganisms when compared with stringent aspiration protocol alone, it has not been found effective on aerobic streptococcus salivarius and, importantly, on anaerobes. the reduced bacterial levels may still carry high infectious risk and may lead to failure in autogenous grafting procedures in oral surgery.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == mechanisms of inhibition by fluoride of urease activities of cell suspensions and biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii and of dental plaque.
AB  == background/aims: fluoride is known to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial ureases  and can also act in the form of hydrofluoric acid as a transmembrane proton conductor to acidify the cytoplasm of intact cells with possible indirect, acid inhibition of urease. our research objectives were to assess the inhibitory potencies of fluoride for three urease-positive bacteria commonly found in the mouth and to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect inhibition  of ureases for overall inhibition of intact cells or biofilms. methods: the experimental design involved intact bacteria in suspensions, mono-organism biofilms, cell extracts, and dental plaque. standard enzymatic assays for ammonia production from urea were used. results: we found that ureolysis by cells in suspensions or mono-organism biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius or actinomyces naeslundii was inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels of 0.1-0.5 mm in a ph-dependent manner. the results of experiments  with the organic weak acids indomethacin and capric acid, which do not directly inhibit urease enzyme, indicated that weak-acid effects leading to cytoplasmic acidification are also involved in fluoride inhibition. however, direct fluoride  inhibition of urease appeared to be the major mechanism for reduction in ureolytic activity in acid environments. results of experiments with freshly harvested supragingival dental plaque indicated responses to fluoride similar to  those of s. salivarius with ph-dependent fluoride inhibition and both direct and  indirect inhibition of urease. conclusion: fluoride can act to diminish alkali production from urea by oral bacteria through direct and indirect mechanisms.

AB  == purpose: this study tested an infection control protocol for photostimulable phosphor (psp) sensors while simulating multiple uses. methods: dental hygiene students (n=36) were randomly assigned to a control group (dry wipe) or test group (disinfectant wipe). a sterile, barriered sensor was placed in a peer patient's mouth to simulate an exposure. after simulation, the barriered sensors  were disinfected, placed into a new barrier, and inserted into the same peer patient's mouth. following the fourth placement and treatment, sensors were vortexed in specimen cups containing trypticase soy broth (tsb) and incubated at  37 degrees c to detect contamination by oral bacteria. results: bacterial growth  in tsb was monitored as a change in optical density and by quantitation of oral streptococci on mitis-salivarius agar. the barrier-protected sensors were minimally contaminated (<10(5) colony forming units/ml at baseline) regardless of treatment. after culture amplification, the control tsb had more samples that remained negative through 48 hours (5/18 vs. 0/18 for test group, p<0.05). conclusion: barrier envelopes used with the psp sensors appeared to be an effective way of reducing microbial contamination.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == urease biogenesis in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == urease biogenesis was monitored in the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus during the growth cycle using in-gel detection and a phenol-hypochloride assay. zymogram analysis, performed in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, enabled visualization of a complex profile of bands whose number and intensity were dependent on the growth phase and culture conditions. the monitoring of urease biogenesis in batch fermentations revealed the onset of  enzyme synthesis starting from the mid-exponential growth phase, with a maximum reached during the late exponential phase. urease activity strongly increased at  acidic ph but to a lesser extent when urea and nickel ions were added to the culture medium. when s. thermophilus cells were cultured with ph maintained at a  neutral value, urease activity was detectable only in gel with extremely low signals. evaluation of beta-glucuronidase activity in strain dsm 20617(t) harboring a transcriptional fusion between a dna fragment containing the putative urease promoter and the gusa reporter evidenced significant expression at neutral ph that strongly increased in an acidic environment. further experiments carried  out on p(urei)-gusa recombinant strain revealed that expression of ure genes was  not affected by carbohydrates, nickel or urea availability. the presence of consistent expression of ure genes at neutral ph and the absence of induction of  expression by carbohydrate availability demonstrated that the transcription of ure genes in s. thermophilus is regulated differently compared with that of the closely related s. salivarius. these differences are discussed taking into consideration the different habitats colonized by the two bacterial species.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of streptococcus salivarius isolates recovered from blood cultures and compare them with isolates  of streptococcus bovis biotypes i and ii. seventeen of the 52 (32%) s. salivarius isolates recovered were considered clinically significant, compared with 62 of the 64 (97%) s. bovis isolates (p<0.0001). bacteremia caused by s. salivarius occurred mostly in patients who showed relevant disruption of the mucous membranes and/or serious underlying diseases. patients with s. salivarius bacteremia were younger than those with s. bovis bacteremia (57 vs. 67 years; p<0.01). patients with s. salivarius bacteremia and patients with s. bovis ii bacteremia had similar rates of endocarditis, colon tumors, and non-colon cancer. on the other hand, when compared with s. bovis i bacteremia, s. salivarius bacteremia was associated with lower rates of endocarditis (18% vs. 74%, respectively) (p<0.01) and colon tumors (0% vs. 57%, respectively) (p<0.005) and  higher rates of non-colon cancer (53% vs. 9.5%, respectively) (p<0.01). bacteremia caused by s. bovis ii had a hepatobiliary origin in 50% of the patients, while, in contrast, that due to s. salivarius or s. bovis i was less frequently associated with a hepatobiliary origin (12% and 5%, respectively) (p<0.00001). the rate of penicillin resistance was 31% among s. salivarius isolates and 0% among s. bovis isolates (p<0.0001). in conclusion, the clinical characteristics of s. salivarius bacteremia and s. bovis ii bacteremia are similar, and the isolation of s. salivarius in blood should not be systematically regarded as contamination.

AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

AB  == the objective of this study was to both isolate and identify non-mutans streptococci organisms (non-mso) from dental plaques recovered on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (msb) plates. the dental plaque samples, which had been collected from 63 human subjects, were diluted and plated on msb.  the bacteria growing on the msb plates were then identified with biochemical tests, as well as with 16s rdna cloning and sequencing techniques. our data indicated that bacteria from 30 subjects had been recovered on the msb plates. among the 21 typical colonies selected from the 30 subjects, 12 colonies, derived from 10 subjects, were identified as non-mso. these 12 colonies were determined to be streptococcus anginosus (8 colonies), s. sanguinis (1 colony), and pantoea  agglomerans (3 colonies). these results strongly suggest that a new selective medium will be required for the reliable isolation of mutans streptococci.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == study of viridans streptococci and staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate patients before and after surgery.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of surgery on types and colony count of streptococcus and staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate (clp) patients.  design: saliva samples were collected after the morning meal by placing a sterile cotton swab in the vestibule of the oral cavity from cleft lip and palate patients immediately preoperative and 12 weeks postoperative. normal children were examined as a control group. samples were cultured; staphylococcus and streptococcus isolates were identified and quantified. patients: fifteen cleft lip and palate patients and 22 normal children, aged 3 to 39 months were examined. results: streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus oralis of the viridans group of streptococci were the most commonly found in normal children, as well as in cleft lip and palate children. in the cleft lip and palate group, mean streptococcal count was 32.41 (29.80) and 46.46  (42.80) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in the normal group, the count was 20.93 (27.93) and 49.92 (34.72) at 0 week and 12 weeks, respectively. staphylococcus aureus was the most common staphylococcus species found in clp patients, representing 47.4% postoperatively. in the cleft lip and palate children, mean staphylococcal count was 5.34 (8.13) and 0.56 (0.92) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in normal children, the count was 0.82 (1.98) and 0.60 (2.55) at 0 and 12 weeks, respectively. the differences were statistically significant only for the staphylococcal count between pre- and postoperative periods in children with cleft lip and palate as tested by analysis of variance (p < .05). conclusions: cleft lip and palate patients had more colonization by s. aureus compared with normal children, and the colony count decreased significantly following surgical repair of the cleft lip and palate.

TI  == effusive-constrictive calcific pericarditis associated with streptococcus salivarius. case report and review of the literature.
AB  == we report the case of a 40-year-old patient presenting with a 6-month history of  dyspnea and edema, with significant worsening of his clinical manifestations for  the 2 weeks before admission to our department. during this 14-day preadmission period, continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) was prescribed elsewhere for management of a working diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. the patient presented to us hemodynamically compromised. management of the patient included emergency cardiac surgery for tamponade caused by effusive-constrictive, calcific pericarditis in addition to antimicrobial treatment as a result of the growth of  streptococcus salivarius from the pericardial fluid. this is the first report in  the literature of association of this microorganism with pericarditis. the use of cpap made the patient's symptoms worse as a result of an increase of the intrathoracic pressure, which was a pathophysiological mechanism, added to the interference of the localized pericardial effusion and the effect of the pericardial constriction. in an era of rapidly increasing use of cpap systems, clinicians should be aware of their possible detrimental effects on patients with some types of cardiopulmonary diseases.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

AB  == objective: the purples of this study was to investigate the role of different components of galla chinensis extract on the growth of 6 kinds of cariogenic bacteria, and to find out the most effective components of galla chinensis extract. methods: four different components (gce1, gce2, gce3 and gce4) were separated from galla chinensis and there antibacterial activities to streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556, streptococcus  salivarius ss 196, actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627, actinomyces viscosus atcc 19246 and lactobacillus rhamnosus ac 413 were checked. there effects on the growth curve of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were also investigated. results:  the most effective part of galla chinensis was found to be gce2 and gce4, which were found to be a mixture of polyphenol-rich fractions. all of the different components had an inhibitory effect to the growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175. conclusion: all of the 4 different components of galla chinensis extract could inhibit the growth of the tested bacteria. these results suggest that the antibacterial activity of galla chinensis extract is caused by a synergistic effect of monomeric polyphenols, which can easily bind to proteins.

TI  == the rationale and potential for the reduction of oral malodour using streptococcus salivarius probiotics.
AB  == the primary treatment for oral malodour is the reduction of bacterial populations, especially those present on the tongue, by use of a variety of antimicrobial agents or mechanical devices. however, shortly after treatment the  problematic bacteria quickly repopulate the tongue and the malodour returns. in our studies, we have used a broadly-active antimicrobial (chlorhexidine) to effect temporary depletion of the oral microbiota and then have attempted to repopulate the tongue surface with streptococcus salivarius k12, a benign commensal probiotic. the objective of this is to prevent re-establishment of non-desirable bacterial populations and thus help limit the re-occurrence of oral malodour over a prolonged period. in this paper, we discuss why contemporary probiotics are inadequate for treatment of oral malodour and examine the rationale for selection of particular bacterial species for future use in the treatment of this condition. in our preliminary trials of the use of a chlorhexidine rinse followed by strain k12 lozenges, the majority (8/13) of subjects with confirmed halitosis maintained reduced breath levels of volatile sulphur compounds for at least 2 weeks. we conclude that probiotic bacterial strains originally sourced from the indigenous oral microbiotas of healthy humans may have potential application as adjuncts for the prevention and treatment of halitosis.

TI  == the doubly phosphorylated form of hpr, hpr(ser~p)(his-p), is abundant in exponentially growing cells of streptococcus thermophilus and phosphorylates the  lactose transporter lacs as efficiently as hpr(his~p).
AB  == in streptococcus thermophilus, lactose is taken up by lacs, a transporter that comprises a membrane translocator domain and a hydrophilic regulatory domain homologous to the iia proteins and protein domains of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts). the iia domain of lacs (iialacs) possesses a histidine residue that can be phosphorylated by hpr(his~p), a protein component of the pts. however, determination of the cellular levels of  the different forms of hpr, namely, hpr, hpr(his~p), hpr(ser-p), and hpr(ser-p)(his~p), in exponentially lactose-growing cells revealed that the doubly phosphorylated form of hpr represented 75% and 25% of the total hpr in s.  thermophilus atcc 19258 and s. thermophilus smq-301, respectively. experiments conducted with [32p]pep and purified recombinant s. thermophilus atcc 19258 proteins (ei, hpr, and iialacs) showed that iialacs was reversibly phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) at a rate similar to that measured with hpr(his~p). sequence analysis of the iialacs protein domains from several s. thermophilus strains indicated that they can be divided into two groups on the basis of their amino acid sequences. the amino acid sequence of iialacs from group i, to which strain  19258 belongs, differed from that of group ii at 11 to 12 positions. to ascertain whether iialacs from group ii could also be phosphorylated by hpr(his~p) and hpr(ser-p)(his~p), in vitro phosphorylation experiments were conducted with purified proteins from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, which possesses a iialacs very similar to group ii s. thermophilus iialacs. the results indicated that s. salivarius iialacs was phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) at a higher rate than that observed with hpr(his~p). our results suggest that the reversible  phosphorylation of iialacs in s. thermophilus is accomplished by hpr(ser-p)(his~p) as well as by hpr(his~p).

TI  == expression of the gtfi gene from streptococcus sobrinus in streptococcus anginosus using integration-mediated transformation system.
AB  == we have constructed a streptococcus anginosus transformant expressing the gtfi gene from streptococcus sobrinus, using a previously developed integration-mediated transformation system to introduce foreign genes onto the oral streptococcal chromosome, and attempted to evaluate the gene expression. in  this system, one cloning plasmid and three pacyc184 derivatives, anchor, heterodimer, and integration plasmids were used for the construction of a series  of integrants via homologous recombination. a portion of s. sobrinus gtfi gene devoid of approximately 1 kb of the 5'-region derived from pmd39 was cloned into  the integration plasmid and introduced onto the s. anginosus chromosome. next, the polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to 2.0 kb of the 5'-region of the gtfi gene from s. sobrinus chromosome was further cloned into the cloning plasmid, and the intact gtfi gene was reconstructed following integration. the final s. anginosus integrant successfully secreted the enzymatically active gtfi  gene products and extracellular enzyme was characterized. this enzyme produced water-insoluble glucans and glucan-forming activity was stimulated by the addition of dextrant10. when this integrant was grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, the integrant adhered to the glass surface in vitro and this integrant exhibited the different colony morphology on mitis-salivarius  agar plates compared to s. sobrinus and s. anginosus. these observations strongly suggest that the construction of s. anginosus integrant expressing s. sobrinus gtfi gene using this transformation system may be an effective means of analysis  of cariogenic biofilm formation.

TI  == bacterial populations on silicone hydrogel and hydrogel contact lenses after swimming in a chlorinated pool.
AB  == purpose: a number of reports have indicated an association between swimming with  contact lenses and subsequent eye infection. this study tests whether a hydrophilic contact lens worn while swimming accumulates bacteria present in the  water. it was of interest to determine whether lens type (silicone hydrogel vs. hydrogel) affected the result. methods: fifteen healthy noncontact lens wearers swam for 30 minutes with a silicone hydrogel lens (purevision, bausch & lomb, rochester, ny) on one eye and a hydrogel lens (acuvue 2, vistakon inc., jacksonville, fl) on the other. lenses were removed aseptically and placed in sterile vials 10 minutes after the subjects left the water. microbial growth was  enumerated for total numbers of colonies and categorized by species present. numbers of colonies were compared between the two lens groups and with a water sample taken from the pool at the time of the experiment. eight of the subjects returned on a different day and wore new lenses for 50 minutes in normal room conditions. results: two lenses were lost while swimming. twenty-seven of the remaining 28 lenses worn while swimming showed colonization, principally with staphylococcus epidermidis, which was also by far the most common species identified from the water itself. small numbers of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus salivarius were also present in the water and on the lenses. numbers of colonies varied among subjects (range, 0 to 230), but no differences were observed between the two lens groups. lenses removed after 30 minutes of wear without swimming were mostly sterile, with 3 of 16 lenses showing just two colonies each. conclusion: it appears that wearing a hydrophilic lens while swimming allows accumulation of microbial organisms on or in the lens, regardless of lens material. swimmers should be advised to wear tight-fitting goggles if lenses are worn while swimming, and thorough disinfection of the lenses before overnight wear seems prudent.

TI  == probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  == purpose of review: the author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. recent findings: normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. combinations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas escherichia coli nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. use of probiotics in crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. probiotics have multiple  mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). although multiple probiotic  species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. summary: probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic  conditions.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effect of antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions.
AB  == background: an antibacterial self-etching primer has been developed to inhibit bacterial attachment and plaque accumulation on the tooth surfaces. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth-inhibitory effect of an antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions. materials and methods: softened dentin specimens were obtained from arrested carious lesions with an excavator or a round steel bur. the effect of a  commercial antibacterial self-etching primer and a commercial self-etching primer on the total streptococci on mitis-salivarius (ms) agar plates and on streptococcus mutans on ms agar plates containing 0.02 m bacitracin (msb) was evaluated. specimens with no primer were used as controls. the number of colonies of both total streptococci and s. mutans were compared statistically with two-way analysis of variance and fisher's protected least squares differences (plsd) test (p < .05). results: the number of colonies of total streptococci (cfu/ml) for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 5.0 x 10(6); for the self-etching primer, 1.0 x 10(5) and 1.0 x 10(5); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. the number of colonies of s. mutans for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 1.8 x 10(5); for the self-etching primer, 3.5 x 10(4) and 5.0 x 10(3); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. regardless of the method of softened dentin removal, the antibacterial effect was significantly higher for the group that had antibacterial self-etching primer compared with that of the control group and the group that had commercial self-etching primer (p < .05). clinical significance: the antibacterial self-etching primer showed a high level of antibacterial activity against mutans streptococci obtained from the arrested carious lesions.

TI  == the microflora of the erupting first permanent molar.
AB  == the relationship between microflora, eruption status and caries status in the first permanent molar of young children was investigated in 177 children aged 6-7 years. a significantly greater proportion of fully erupted teeth were classified  as sound and plaque-free compared to partially erupted teeth. fully erupted teeth yielded greater numbers and proportions of mutans streptococci compared with significantly greater numbers and proportions of actinomyces israelii in partially erupted teeth. logistical regression analysis showed significant associations between white spot lesions in partially erupted teeth and increased  numbers of streptococcus oralis, mutans streptococci and streptococcus salivarius whereas the presence of actinomyces naeslundii was associated with health. significantly greater numbers and proportions of s. oralis and s. salivarius were isolated from partially erupted teeth with white spot lesions whereas streptococcus mutans was isolated in significantly greater numbers and proportions from fully erupted molars with white spots. this study suggests that  organisms other than mutans streptococci are associated with caries development in erupting permanent molar teeth.

TI  == streptococcus sinensis may react with lancefield group f antiserum.
AB  == lancefield group f streptococci have been found almost exclusively as members of  the 'streptococcus milleri' group, although they have been reported very occasionally in some other streptococcal species. among 302 patients with bacteraemia caused by viridans streptococci over a 6-year period, three cases were caused by streptococcus sinensis (type strain hku4t, hku5 and hku6). all three patients had infective endocarditis complicating their underlying chronic rheumatic heart diseases. gene sequencing showed no base differences between the  16s rrna gene sequences of hku5 and hku6 and that of hku4t. all three strains were gram-positive, non-spore-forming cocci arranged in chains. all grew on sheep blood agar as alpha-haemolytic, grey colonies of 0.5-1 mm in diameter after 24 h  incubation at 37 degrees c in ambient air. lancefield grouping revealed that hku5 and hku6 were lancefield group f, but hku4t was non-groupable with lancefield groups a, b, c, d, f or g antisera. hku4t was identified by the vitek system (gpi), api system (20 strep) and atb system (id32 strep) as 99 % streptococcus intermedius, 51.3 % s. intermedius and 99.9 % streptococcus anginosus, respectively. using the same tests, hku5 was identified as 87 % streptococcus sanguinis/streptococcus gordonii, 59 % streptococcus salivarius and 99.6 % s. anginosus, respectively, and hku6 as 87 % s. sanguinis/s. gordonii, 77 % streptococcus pneumoniae and 98.3 % s. anginosus, respectively. the present data  revealed that a proportion of lancefield group f streptococci could be s. sinensis. lancefield group f streptococci should not be automatically reported as 's. milleri'.

TI  == candida albicans and streptococcus salivarius modulate il-6, il-8, and tnf-alpha  expression and secretion by engineered human oral mucosa cells.
AB  == we investigated the involvement of oral epithelial cells via two cytokines (il-6  and tnf-alpha) and one chemokine (il-8) in local defences against live yeast (candida albicans) and bacteria (streptococcus salivarius) using an engineered human oral mucosa model. we report that the yeast changed from the blastospore to the hyphal form and induced significant tissue disorganization at later contact periods (24 and 48 h) compared to the bacteria. however, this effect did not reduce the viability or total number of epithelial cells. gene activation analyses revealed that il-6, il-8 and tnf-alpha mrna levels rose in tissues in contact with live c. albicans or s. salivarius. gene activation was followed by an upregulation of protein secretion. il-6 levels were higher after contact with  c. albicans than with s. salivarius. il-8 levels after contact with s. salivarius were higher than with c. albicans. our study suggests that s. salivarius is more  efficient at inducing proinflammatory mediator release than c. albicans. these results provide additional evidence for the contribution of oral epithelial cells to the inflammatory response against fungi and bacteria.

AB  == four oral bacterial strains, of which two are considered aciduric and two are considered acid-sensitive, were grown under glucose-limiting conditions in chemostats to determine whether their membrane fatty acid profiles were altered in response to environmental acidification. streptococcus gordonii dl1, as well as the aciduric strains s. salivarius 57.i, and lactobacillus casei 4646 increased the levels of mono-unsaturated membrane fatty acids. the non-aciduric strain s. sanguis 10904 did not alter its membrane composition in response to ph  values examined here. thus, in response to low ph, aciduric oral bacteria alter their membrane composition to contain increased levels of long-chained, mono-unsaturated fatty acids. this suggests that membrane fatty acid adaptation is a common mechanism utilized by bacteria to withstand environmental stress.

TI  == characterization of a galactokinase-positive recombinant strain of streptococcus  thermophilus.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus is widely used by the dairy  industry for its ability to transform lactose, the primary sugar found in milk, into lactic acid. unlike the phylogenetically related species streptococcus salivarius, s. thermophilus is unable to metabolize and grow on galactose and thus releases substantial amounts of this hexose into the external medium during  growth on lactose. this metabolic property may result from the inability of s. thermophilus to synthesize galactokinase, an enzyme of the leloir pathway that phosphorylates intracellular galactose to generate galactose-1-phosphate. in this work, we report the complementation of gal(-) strain s. thermophilus smq-301 with s. salivarius galk, the gene that codes for galactokinase, and the characterization of recombinant strain smq-301k01. the recombinant strain, which  was obtained by transformation of strain smq-301 with ptrkl2tk, a plasmid bearing s. salivarius galk, grew on galactose with a generation time of 55 min, which was almost double the generation time on lactose. data confirmed that (i) the ability of smq-301k01 to grow on galactose resulted from the expression of s. salivarius  galk and (ii) transcription of the plasmid-borne galk gene did not require galr,  a transcriptional regulator of the gal and lac operons, and did not interfere with the transcription of these operons. unexpectedly, recombinant strain smq-301k01 still expelled galactose during growth on lactose, but only when the amount of the disaccharide in the medium exceeded 0.05%. thus, unlike s. salivarius, the ability to metabolize galactose was not sufficient for s. thermophilus to simultaneously metabolize the glucose and galactose moieties of lactose. nevertheless, during growth in milk and under time-temperature conditions that simulated those used to produce mozzarella cheese, the recombinant gal(+) strain grew and produced acid more rapidly than the gal(-) wild-type strain.

AB  == the ability of biosurfactant obtained from the probiotic bacterium lactococcus lactis 53 to inhibit adhesion of four bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the microbial cell surfaces and the silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed biosurfactant layer were characterized using contact-angle measurements. water contact angles indicated that the silicone-rubber surface with adsorbed biosurfactant was more hydrophilic (48 degrees) than bare silicone rubber (109 degrees). the results showed that the biosurfactant was effective in decreasing the initial deposition rates of staphylococcus epidermidis gb 9/6 from 2,100 to 220 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), streptococcus salivarius gb 24/9 from 1560 to 137 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), and staphylococcus aureus gb 2/1 from 1255 to 135 microorganisms cm(-2) s(-1), allowing for a 90% reduction of the deposition rates. the deposition rates of rothia dentocariosa gbj 52/2b, candida albicans gbj 13/4a, and candida tropicalis gb 9/9 were far less reduced in the presence of the biosurfactant as compared with the other strains. this study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone-rubber voice prostheses.

TI  == prevention of streptococcal pharyngitis by anti-streptococcus pyogenes bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) produced by streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == background & objectives: streptococcus salivarius is a numerically prominent member of the human oral microbiota that produces a variety of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) having in vitro inhibitory activity against s. pyogenes. our previous studies of s. salivarius isolates from children using a deferred antagonism blis production (p)-typing scheme showed that the 9 per cent  of children having large populations of p-type 677 s. salivarius experienced fewer s. pyogenes acquisitions than either the 11 per cent of children having predominant p-type 226 populations or the 60 per cent of children with largely non-inhibitory (p-type 000) s. salivarius. amongst the other blis p-types detected were a number of strongly-inhibitory (p-type 777) s. salivarius. in the  present study the inhibitory agents produced by prototype strains of p-types 226, 677 and 777 s. salivarius are compared. methods: the prototype blis-producing s.  salivarius strains sn, 20p3, and k12 were isolated from tongue swabbings. blis p-typing was done using standard procedures. the blis molecules were purified and characterized. results: s. salivarius sn (p-type 226) produces a heat-labile muramidase. s. salivarius 20p3 (p-type 677) produces the 2315 da lantibiotic salivaricin a and s. salivarius k12 (p-type 777) produces two lantibiotics; salivaricin a2 (2368 da) and salivaricin b (2733 da). interpretation & conclusion: the p-type 777 s. salivarius strain produced salivaricin a2 and salivaricin b. the combined production of two anti-s. pyogenes blis activities by this strain indicates that it could be adopted as a colonizing strain in bacterial interference trials.

AB  == zymographic analysis was performed to know the bacteriolytic enzyme profiles of 4% sds extracts of oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius. we investigated the five strains in each species and found that the profile was very similar among strains of the same species except for s. salivarius(the profile was classified into two types). on the other hand, the profile was considerably different among species. two major bacteriolytic enzymes of s. mutans showing molecular mass of 80 and 100 kda were  found using sds-boiled s. mutans or s. sobrinus cells as substrate. these bacteriolytic activities were less apparent in the gel containing s. mitis or s.  salivarius, and also not detectable in the gel containing s. sanguis. s. sobrinus extract showed only one bacteriolytic band (78 kda) as strong activity using s. sobrinus cells as substrate. s. sanguis extract showed no bacteriolytic bands using any streptococcal cells. extracts of either s. mitis or s. salivarius showed weak activity by using respective strains as substrate.

TI  == [streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. although it is usually considered to have low virulence, s. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. on the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by s. salivarius, s. mitis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. we report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. cerebrospinal cultures grew s. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. the patient was successfully treated with penicillin g and left the hospital without sequelae. in the literature, bacterial meningitis due to s. salivarius is rarely  reported. of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. we discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to s. salivarius cases reports. the early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans group streptococcal blood isolates to eight antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a total of 155 viridans group streptococci blood culture isolates identified by the rapid id32 strep system were tested for their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) to penicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, clindamycin, rifampicin, vancomycin and teicoplanin using the e-test. the following species were identified: s. oralis (n = 67), s. mitis (n = 66), s. sanguis (n = 7), s. salivarius (n = 5), s. parasanguis (n = 4), s. gordonii (n =  3) and s. mutans (n = 3). s. oralis and s. mitis demonstrated the highest levels  of resistance to the agents tested. there were 27% of s. oralis isolates resistant to pencillin, 51% resistant to erythromycin and 6% resistant to clindamycin. for s. mitis 11% were resistant to penicillin, 40% resistant to erythromycin and 3% resistant to clindamycin. penicillin resistant isolates (mic  > or = 2 mg/l) also demonstrated decreased susceptibility to other antimicrobial  agents tested in this study. high level resistance (mic > or = 2 mg/l) to ceftriaxone was found in 12 isolates. the isolates identified as ceftriaxone resistant comprised s. oralis (n = 7), s. mitis (n = 4) and s. parasanguis (n = 1). this study has highlighted the difference in susceptibility between different species of viridans group streptococci. these findings are of concern in the light of spread of antibiotic resistance genes from s. oralis and s. mitis to the more invasive pneumococcus.

TI  == survey of bacterial proteins released in cheese: a proteomic approach.
AB  == during the ripening of emmental cheese, the bacterial ecosystem confers its organoleptic characteristics to the evolving curd both by the action of the living cells, and through the release of numerous proteins, including various types of enzymes into the cheese when the cells lyse. in emmental cheese these proteins can be released from thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters  like lactobacillus helveticus, lb delbruecki subsp. lactis and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and ripening bacteria such as propionibacterium freudenreichii. the aim of this study was to obtain a proteomic view of the different groups of proteins within the cheese using proteomic tools to create a  reference map. a methodology was therefore developed to reduce the complexity of  cheese matrix prior to 2d-page analysis. the aqueous phase of cheese was prefractionated by size exclusion chromatography, bacterial and milk proteins were separated and subsequently characterised by mass spectrometry, prior to peptide mass fingerprint and sequence homology database search. five functional groups of proteins were identified involved in: (i) proteolysis, (ii) glycolysis, (iii) stress response, (iv) dna and rna repair and (v) oxidoreduction. the results revealed stress responses triggered by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria  and propionibacterium strains at the end of ripening. information was also obtained regarding the origin and nature of the peptidases released into the cheese, thus providing a greater understanding of casein degradation mechanisms during ripening. different peptidases arose from st thermophilus and lb helveticus, suggesting that streptococci are involved in peptide degradation in addition to the proteolytic activity of lactobacilli.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies  on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. subjects and methods: forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. during the patients' first  visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on api 20s and api 20a as appropriate. results: a total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with  a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and streptococcus mutans,  17.1 and 52.5%. the frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, bacteroides spp., porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. conclusion: the results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental  plaque of the pediatric dental patients in kuwait. the high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the  developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.

TI  == pcr detection and identification of oral streptococci in saliva samples using gtf genes.
AB  == oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. therefore, accurate identification of oral  streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. we established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by pcr using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. with the species-specific primers, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial dna from saliva. using the resultant dna as a template, the proposed pcr detection was performed. their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. these findings indicate that the present pcr method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.

TI  == biochemical and molecular characterization of a levansucrase from lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri strain 121 employs a fructosyltransferase (ftf) to synthesize a fructose polymer [a fructan of the levan type, with beta(2-->6) linkages] from sucrose or raffinose. purification of this ftf (a levansucrase), and identification of peptide amino acid sequences, allowed isolation of the first lactobacillus levansucrase gene (lev), encoding a protein (lev) consisting  of 804 amino acids. lev showed highest similarity with an inulosucrase of l. reuteri 121 [inu; producing an inulin polymer with beta(2-->1)-linked fructosyl units] and with ftfs from streptococci. expression of lev in escherichia coli resulted in an active ftf (lev delta 773his) that produced the same levan polymer [with only 2-3 % beta(2-->1-->6) branching points] as l. reuteri 121 cells grown  on raffinose. the low degree of branching of the l. reuteri levan is very different from bacterial levans known up to now, such as that of streptococcus salivarius, having up to 30 % branches. although lev is unusual in showing a higher hydrolysis than transferase activity, significant amounts of levan polymer are produced both in vivo and in vitro. lev is strongly dependent on ca(2+) ions  for activity. unique properties of l. reuteri lev together with inu are: (i) the  presence of a c-terminal cell-wall-anchoring motif causing similar expression problems in escherichia coli, (ii) a relatively high optimum temperature for activity for ftf enzymes, and (iii) at 50 degrees c, kinetics that are best described by the hill equation.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == mechanism of proton gating of a urea channel.
AB  == the size and complexity of many ph-gated channels have frustrated the development of specific structural models. the small acid-activated six-membrane segment urea channel of helicobacter hepaticus (hhurei), homologous to the essential urei of the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori, enables identification of all the periplasmic sites of proton gating by site-directed mutagenesis. exposure to external acidity enhances [(14)c]urea uptake by xenopus oocytes expressing hhurei, with half-maximal activity (ph(0.5)) at ph 6.8. a downward shift of ph(0.5) in single site mutants identified four of six protonatable periplasmic residues (his-50 at the boundary of the second transmembrane segment tm2, glu-56  in the first periplasmic loop, asp-59 at the boundary of tm3, and his-170 at the  boundary of tm6) that affect proton gating. asp-59 was the only site at which a protonatable residue appeared to be essential for ph gating. mutation of glu-110  or glu-114 in pl2 did not affect the ph(0.5) of gating. a chimera, where the entire periplasmic domain of hhurei was fused to the membrane domain of streptococcus salivarius urei (ssurei), retained the ph-independent properties of ssurei. hence, proton gating of hhurei likely depends upon the formation of hydrogen bonds by periplasmic residues that in turn produce conformational changes of the transmembrane domain. further studies on hhurei may facilitate understanding of other physiologically important ph-responsive channels.

TI  == physiologic actions of zinc related to inhibition of acid and alkali production by oral streptococci in suspensions and biofilms.
AB  == zinc is a known inhibitor of acid production by mutans streptococci. our primary  objective was to extend current knowledge of the physiologic bases for this inhibition and also for zinc inhibition of alkali production by streptococcus rattus fa-1 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419. zinc at concentrations as low as 0.01-0.1 mm not only inhibited acid production by cells of streptococcus mutans gs-5 in suspensions or in biofilms but also sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acidification. zinc reversibly inhibited the f-atpase of permeabilized cells of s. mutans with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 1 mm for cells in suspensions. zinc reversibly inhibited the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system with 50% inhibition at about 0.3 mm znso4, or about half that concentration when the zinc-citrate chelate was used. the reversibility of these inhibitory actions of zinc correlates with findings that it is mainly bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. zinc inhibited alkali production from arginine or urea and was a potent enzyme inhibitor for arginine deiminase of s. rattus fa-1 and for urease of s. salivarius. in addition, zinc citrate at high levels of 10-20 mm was weakly bactericidal.

AB  == aims: the milk acidification rate of streptococcus thermophilus strains can be affected by several factors, one of which is the hydrolysis of urea by the urease complex. to evaluate the technological suitability of s. thermophilus strains deprived of urease activity in milk fermentation, the genetic cluster related to  urease enzymatic activity has been characterized in the type strain dsm 20167t. methods and results: amplification of the urease genes of s. thermophilus dsm 20167t was developed on the basis of the urease gene cluster of the phylogenetically related s. salivarius. nucleotide sequencing revealed the presence of eight open reading frames, which were most homologous to ureabc (structural genes) and urei, ureefgd (accessory genes) of s. salivarius and other ureolytic bacteria. reverse transcriptase pcr experiments were in agreement with  an operon organization for the eight genes (ureiabcefgd). a food grade mutant a16 (deltaurec3) with a 693 bp in-frame deletion in urec gene exhibited a urease negative (ure-) phenotype. unlike the wild-type strain, the acidification rate of the mutant in reconstituted skimmed milk was not affected by the presence of urea or nickel ions. a small-scale yoghurt fermentation trials were carried out using  the wild-type or the ure- mutant a16 (deltaurec3) in co-culture with lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus atcc 11842 in presence of urea. the result obtained underlines that when the ure- mutant was used as a co-starter the acidification rate was higher than that obtained using the wild-type strain. conclusions: the study provides the first genetic characterization and the technological implication of s. thermophilus dsm 20617t urease activity. significance and impact of the study: the detrimental effect of ureolytic activity on the rate of milk acidification was evaluated and superseded using a food-grade ure- recombinant strain. small-scale yoghurt production trials highlighted the positive role of a ure-s. thermophilus mutant as a co-starter in  milk fermentations. moreover, the vector pmi108 developed for the construction of the ure- strain, should be considered as a potential tool for the generation of ure- dairy s. thermophilus strains selected for other relevant technological properties but characterized by the undesirable ureolytic phenotype.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of the mechanisms of macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin resistance in viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the presence of erm genes conferring constitutive and inducible resistance, as well as that of the mefa gene conferring only constitutive resistance, was investigated using pcr in 70 erythromycin resistant (mic>or=1 mg/l) strains of viridans group streptococci (vgs) (18 streptococcus mitis biotype 1, 16 s. mitis  biotype 2, 15 s. oralis, 12 s. salivarius and nine s. sanguis) isolated from the  oropharynx of healthy greek children. all of the 56 isolates belonging to resistance phenotype m harbored the mefa gene. all of the 14 isolates constitutively resistant to macrolides and lincosamides (phenotype cr) harbored the ermb gene. co-presence of both genes was not observed, whereas class a erm gene (previously known as ermtr) was not detected. our results are consistent with a possible role of vgs as a reservoir of resistance genes now prevalent in pathogenic species of streptococci.

TI  == purification and characterization of the streptococcus salivarius methionine aminopeptidase (metap).
AB  == streptococcus salivarius methionine aminopeptidase (metap) was purified from a recombinant escherichia coli strain containing the s. salivarius map gene, which  codes for metap. s. salivarius map coded for a protein of 286 amino acids with a  calculated molecular mass of 31,723 da and a pi of 4.6. the native enzyme eluted  from a superdex column as a protein with a molecular mass of 30.6 kda and cleaved n-terminal met of peptide only when the penultimate amino acid was gly, ala, ser, val, pro, or thr. the enzyme was more active against tetrapeptides than tripeptides and did not recognize dipeptides. it required the presence of a metal cation for activity, with a preference for co(2+) over mn(2+). s. salivarius metap has a ph optimum of 8.0 and an optimal temperature at 50 degrees c. the s.  salivarius protein had an extra sequence of 24 amino acids between two conserved  aspartate residues involved in the coordination of the metal ion. a similar extra sequence is present in metap from other streptococci and from lactococcus lactis, but not from other bacteria or eukaryotes.

TI  == multiple competitive pcr-dgge as a tool for quantifying and profiling defined mixed cultures of lactic acid bacteria during production of probiotics from complex polysaccharides.
AB  == aims: to apply a denaturing gradient gel electrophoretic (dgge) method to quantify and profile individual strains during a mixed culture fermentation. methods and results: dna was extracted during the culture of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and amplified in a multiple competitive pcr (cpcr) using general primers targeting 16s rdna and dna from streptococcus salivarius as competitive dna. subsequently the 200-kb amplified fragments were separated by dgge. the method was validated in pure cultures and used to profile a mixture of three lab grown on glucose, soluble starch and glycogen from mussel processing waste. the inclusion of a starch- and glycogen-degrading strain (lactobacillus plantarum) and a weakly amylotic nisin-resistant strain (lact. paracasei) allowed proliferation of the nisin producing lactococcus lactis which in itself is unable to grow on complex carbohydrates. cpcr-dgge permitted the monitoring of a different strain succession on the different carbohydrates, related to amylolytic activity and substrate consumption, acid production and nisin production. conclusions: cpcr-dgge is a useful tool for profiling defined mixed cultures of bacteria and hence allows their interaction to be studied. significance and impact of the study: provided validation of the method for each specific case, it may be appropriate to monitor and control the reproducibility of any defined mixed culture of bacteria, with the advantage that an increase in the strain numbers to be monitored does not yield an increase in the labour of the procedure.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == identification and characterization of the nickel uptake system for urease biogenesis in streptococcus salivarius 57.i.
AB  == ureases are multisubunit enzymes requiring ni(2+) for activity. the low ph-inducible urease gene cluster in streptococcus salivarius 57.i is organized as an operon, beginning with urei, followed by ureabc (structural genes), and ureefgd (accessory genes). urease biogenesis also requires a high-affinity ni(2+) uptake system. by searching the partial genome sequence of a closely related organism, streptococcus thermophilus lmg18311, three open reading frame (orfs) homologous to those encoding proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and cobalt transport (cbimqo) were identified immediately 3' to the ure operon. to determine whether these genes were involved in urease biogenesis by catalyzing ni(2+) uptake in s. salivarius, regions 3' to ured were amplified by pcrs from s. salivarius by using primers identical to the s. thermophilus sequences. sequence  analysis of the products revealed three orfs. reverse transcriptase pcr was used  to demonstrate that the orfs are transcribed as part of the ure operon. insertional inactivation of orf1 with a polar kanamycin marker completely abolished urease activity and the ability to accumulate (63)ni(2+) during growth. supplementation of the growth medium with nicl(2) at concentrations as low as 2.5 micro m partially restored urease activity in the mutant. both wild-type and mutant strains showed enhanced urease activity when exogenous ni(2+) was provided at neutral ph. enhancement of urease activity by adding nickel was regulated at the posttranslational level. thus, orf1, orf2, and orf3 are part of the ure operon, and these genes, designated urem, ureq, and ureo, respectively, likely encode a ni(2+)-specific atp-binding cassette transporter.

TI  == phosphorylation of streptococcus salivarius lactose permease (lacs) by hpr(his ~  p) and hpr(ser-p)(his ~ p) and effects on growth.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius takes up lactose via a transporter called lacs that shares 95% identity with the lacs from streptococcus thermophilus, a phylogenetically closely related organism. s. thermophilus releases galactose into the medium during growth on lactose. expulsion of galactose is mediated via lacs and stimulated by phosphorylation of the transporter by hpr(his approximately p), a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). unlike s. thermophilus, s. salivarius grew on lactose without expelling galactose and took  up galactose and lactose concomitantly when it is grown in a medium containing both sugars. analysis of the c-terminal end of s. salivarius lacs revealed a iia-like domain (iia(lacs)) almost identical to the iia domain of s. thermophilus lacs. experiments performed with purified proteins showed that s. salivarius iia(lacs) was reversibly phosphorylated on a histidine residue at position 552 not only by hpr(his approximately p) but also by hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p), a doubly phosphorylated form of hpr present in large amounts in rapidly growing s. salivarius cells. two other major s. salivarius pts proteins, iiab(l)(man) and iiab(h)(man), were unable to phosphorylate iia(lacs). the effect of lacs phosphorylation on growth was studied with strain g71, an s. salivarius enzyme i-negative mutant that cannot synthesize hpr(his approximately p) or hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p). these results indicated that (i) the wild-type and mutant strains had identical generation times on lactose, (ii) neither strain expelled galactose during growth on lactose, (iii) both strains metabolized lactose and galactose concomitantly when grown in a medium containing both sugars, and (iv) the growth of the mutant was slightly reduced on galactose.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to an antimicrobial decapeptide.
AB  == naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have emerged as alternative classes of antimicrobials. in general, these antimicrobial peptides exhibit selectivity for  prokaryotes and minimize the problems of engendering microbial resistance. as an  alternative method to search for more effective broad-spectrum peptide antimicrobials, investigators have developed peptide libraries by using synthetic combinatorial technology. a novel decapeptide, kkvvfkvkfk (ksl), has been identified that shows a broad range of antibacterial activity. the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of this antimicrobial peptide in killing selected strains of oral pathogens and resident saliva bacteria collected from human subjects. cytotoxic activity of ksl against mammalian cells and the structural features of this decapeptide were also investigated, the latter by using two-dimensional nmr in aqueous and dmso solutions. mics of ksl for the majority of oral bacteria tested in vitro ranged from 3 to 100 microg ml(-1). minimal bactericidal concentrations of ksl were, in general, within one to two dilutions of the mics. ksl exhibited an ed(99) (the dose at which 99 % killing was observed after 15 min at 37 degrees c) of 6.25 microg ml(-1) against selected strains of lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in addition, ksl damaged bacterial cell membranes and caused 1.05 log units reduction of viability counts of saliva bacteria. in vitro toxicity studies showed that ksl, at concentrations up to 1 mg ml(-1), did not induce cell death or compromise the membrane integrity of human gingival fibroblasts. nmr studies suggest that ksl adopts an alpha-helical structure in dmso solution, which mimics the polar aprotic membrane environment,  whereas it remains unstructured in aqueous medium. this study shows that ksl may  be a useful antimicrobial agent for inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria that are associated with caries development and early plaque formation.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  == poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of peo-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. in this paper, a peo-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. subsequently, the presence of a peo-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. for five bacterial (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (candida albicans and candida tropicalis), adhesion to peo-brushes  was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rates of sta. epidermidis, sta. aureus and str. salivarius to  glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while e. coli and p. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. the initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for c. albicans gb 1/2 and c. tropicalis gb 9/9, respectively. coating of the glass surface with a peo-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic p. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. for both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic c. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic c. albicans. the peo-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the lifshitz-van der waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. decreased lifshitz-van der waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == identification of mutans streptococci by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes.
AB  == mutans streptococci are frequently isolated from dental plaque and carious lesions. these bacteria have been identified by conventional methods such as biochemical and serologic tests followed by the isolation of colonies on the mitis-salivarius agar, which are sometimes inconsistent. recently, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been reported to rapidly identify streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. however, in the case of identification and classification into several species, e.g. within the group of  mutans streptococci consisting of seven species, the identification using species-specific pcr seems somewhat inefficient because of need for the development and preparation of specific primers for each species. therefore, in this study we developed a simple method using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of pcr-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes (16s rrna genes pcr-rflp) for the identification of seven different species included in the group of mutans streptococci. we amplified 16s rrna gene sequences from genomic dna samples by pcr using universal primers and digested the pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. hpaii produced six rflp patterns for eight reference strains, since the patterns for s. sobrinus, streptococcus downei and streptococcus ferus were similar. rflp patterns produced with haeiii could separate these three species. furthermore, the rflp patterns predicted from the 16s rrna gene sequences in the genbank database agreed with the actual rflp patterns produced in the present study. the 16s rrna sequence comparisons can be  used to identify oral mutans streptococci; however, the identification by sequencing is sometimes difficult in large-scale studies and for small laboratories. therefore, 16s rrna genes pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, could be an alternative method for the identification of mutans streptococci, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the cariogenicity of mutans streptococci.

TI  == bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) production by the normal flora of the nasopharynx: potential to protect against otitis media?
AB  == the normal bacterial flora of the upper airways provides an important barrier to  invading pathogens. this study investigated the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis) by streptococci isolated from the nasopharyngeal flora of children who either do or do not experience recurrent acute otitis media (aom). twenty children with recurrent aom and 15 controls were tested. swabs from the nasopharynx were evaluated for streptococci having blis activity against two  representative strains of each of the aom pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococci displaying strong blis activity were characterized further and tested for known streptococcal bacteriocin structural genes. sixty-five per cent  of children had nasopharyngeal streptococcal isolates that were inhibitory to strains of one or more of the aom pathogens. six children (17 %) had streptococci that demonstrated strong blis activity against strains of at least three of the pathogenic species. three of these inhibitory isolates were streptococcus salivarius, two were s. pneumoniae and one was s. pyogenes. the inhibitory s. salivarius and s. pyogenes were shown to have structural genes for known streptococcal bacteriocins. no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups of children with respect to the presence of inhibitory streptococci in their nasopharyngeal floras. the finding of s. salivarius with strong inhibitory activity against several aom pathogens in the nasopharyngeal flora of children is unique. although there is no clear evidence from the present study that these organisms protect against aom, their low pathogenicity and strong in-vitro blis production capability indicate that they should be incorporated in future trials of bacteriotherapy for recurrent aom.

TI  == the hpr(ser) kinase of streptococcus salivarius: a hexameric bifunctional enzyme  controlled by glycolytic intermediates and inorganic phosphate.
AB  == phosphorylation of hpr, the small phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, on ser46 by the hpr(ser) kinase (hprk/p) is a vital step in catabolite repression in gram-positive bacteria. streptococcus salivarius hprk/p is reported to be a multimeric protein  not regulated by metabolic intermediates. we re-evaluated the molecular mass of s. salivarius hprk/p using sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, demonstrated that s. salivarius hprk/p dephosphorylated hpr(ser-p) and further characterised the effect of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and other metabolic intermediates on enzyme activities. the molecular mass of s. salivarius hprk/p was 201305 da, suggesting that streptococcal hprk/p was a hexameric protein. fructose 1,6-bisphosphate poorly activated streptococcal hprk/p but protected kinase activity against inhibition by inorganic phosphate and inhibited dephosphorylation of hpr(ser-p). phosphoenolpyruvate and 2-phosphoglycerate, but  not fructose 1-p, fructose 6-p, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, also protected kinase activity against inhibition by inorganic phosphate. thus, unlike previous  reports, we show that fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and other key glycolytic intermediates played a pivotal role as a modulator of streptococcal hprk/p activities.

AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

AB  == thirty eight strains of oral streptococci were divided into six types by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) followed by glycosyltransferase (glt)  activity stain: type 1, streptococcus mutans; type 2, streptococcus rattus; type  3, streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus downei; type 4, streptococcus cricetus; type 5, streptococcus salivarius; and type 6, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii. in types 1, 2 and 5, two glucosyltransferases synthesizing water-insoluble (gtf-i) and water-soluble glucans (gtf-s) and a fructosyltransferase (ftf) were detected. in types 3 and 4, gtf-i and two gtf-ss were detected. only one gtf-s was detected in type 6. the 2-de patterns for these six types were clearly distinguished from each other based on the kind, number and location of glts in gel.

TI  == bacterial replacement therapy: adapting 'germ warfare' to infection prevention.
AB  == the individual bacterial members of our indigeneous microbiota are actively engaged in an on-going battle to prevent colonisation and overgrowth of their terrain by competing microbes, some of which might have pathogenic potential for  the host. humans have long attempted to intervene in these bacterial interactions. ingestion of probiotic bacteria, particularly lactobacilli, is commonly practiced to promote well-balanced intestinal microflora. as bacterial resistance to antimicrobials has increased, so too has research into colonisation of human tissues with specific effector strains capable of out-competing known bacterial pathogens. recent progress is particularly evident in the application of avirulent streptococcus mutans to the control of dental caries, alpha hemolytic streptococci to reduction of otitis media recurrences and streptococcus salivarius to streptococcal pharyngitis prevention.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == palmitoleic acid isomer (c16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

TI  == in vitro testing of xylitol as an anticariogenic agent.
AB  == a number of studies involving xylitol chewing gum have demonstrated that xylitol  is both noncariogenic and anticariogenic. the ability of xylitol to act as an anticariogenic agent most likely is due to its ability to be transported into caries-causing oral bacteria and inhibiting fermentation either by depleting the  cell of high-energy phosphate or by poisoning the glycolytic system. in vitro tests were conducted to determine the concentration of xylitol required to inhibit the growth of three strains of oral streptococcus (s. mutans, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis). all three strains were inhibited significantly at xylitol concentrations of 12.5% and higher; however, only s. mutans was inhibited significantly at a xylitol concentration of 1.56%.

AB  == the 16s-23s rrna internal transcribed spacer (its) region of several streptococcus thermophilus strains and some related dairy streptococci, s. macedonicus, s. salivarius and s. bovis, was analysed by sequence analysis. all the streptococcus species were easily discriminated on the basis of sequence variations principally located upstream and downstream of the region encompassing the double-stranded processing sites and the trna(ala) gene. comparison between trna(ala) gene sequences highlighted a high level of sequence conservation among  the streptococcus species investigated despite their belonging to separated phylogenetic clusters, i.e. the s. salivarius and s. bovis rrna groups. a low but significant degree of variability was detected among the s. thermophilus strains, allowing the identification of four different its sequences. similarity analysis  of the its sequences showed that the streptococcus species were clustered in two  main branches, one containing s. macedonicus and s. bovis strains, and one containing s. thermophilus and s. salivarius strains. with the aim of developing  a rapid tool for the identification of the dairy streptococci species a multiplex its-sscp analysis of two discrete regions within the its locus was carried out.

TI  == diversity of bacterial populations on the tongue dorsa of patients with halitosis and healthy patients.
AB  == the primary purpose of the present study was to compare the microbial profiles of the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects and subjects with halitosis by using culture-independent molecular methods. our overall goal was to determine the bacterial diversity on the surface of the tongue dorsum as part of our ongoing efforts to identify all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species of the oral cavity. tongue dorsum scrapings were analyzed from healthy subjects with no complaints of halitosis and subjects with halitosis, defined as an organoleptic score of 2 or more and volatile sulfur compound levels greater than 200 ppb. 16s  rrna genes from dna isolated from tongue dorsum scrapings were amplified by pcr with universally conserved bacterial primers and cloned into escherichia coli. typically, 50 to 100 clones were analyzed from each subject. fifty-one strains isolated from the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects were also analyzed. partial sequences of approximately 500 bases of cloned inserts from the 16s rrna genes of isolates were compared with sequences of known species or phylotypes to determine species identity or closest relatives. nearly complete sequences of about 1,500 bases were obtained for potentially novel species or phylotypes. in an analysis of approximately 750 clones, 92 different bacterial species were identified. about half of the clones were identified as phylotypes, of which 29 were novel to the tongue microbiota. fifty-one of the 92 species or phylotypes were detected in more than one subject. those species most associated with healthy subjects were streptococcus salivarius, rothia mucilaginosa, and an uncharacterized species of  eubacterium (strain ftb41). streptococcus salivarius was the predominant species  in healthy subjects, as it represented 12 to 40% of the total clones analyzed from each healthy subject. overall, the predominant microbiota on the tongue dorsa of healthy subjects was different from that on the tongue dorsa of subjects with halitosis. those species most associated with halitosis were atopobium parvulum, a phylotype (clone bs095) of dialister, eubacterium sulci, a phylotype  (clone dr034) of the uncultivated phylum tm7, solobacterium moorei, and a phylotype (clone bw009) of streptococcus: on the basis of our ongoing efforts to  obtain full 16s rrna sequences for all cultivable and not-yet-cultivated species  that colonize the oral cavity, there are now over 600 species.

TI  == the gastric biology of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == helicobacter pylori is a neutralophilic, gram-negative, ureolytic organism that is able to colonize the human stomach but does not survive in a defined medium with a ph <4.0 unless urea is present. in order to live in the gastric environment, it has developed a repertoire of acid resistance mechanisms that can be classified into time-independent, acute, and chronic responses. time-independent acid resistance depends on the structure of the organism's inner and outer membrane proteins that have a high isoelectric point, thereby reducing  their proton permeability. acute acid resistance depends on the constitutive synthesis of a neutral ph optimum urease that is an oligomeric ni(2+)-containing  heterodimer of urea and ureb subunits. gastric juice urea is able to rapidly access intrabacterial urease when the periplasmic ph falls below approximately 6.2 owing to ph-gating of a urea channel, urei. this results in the formation of  nh3, which then neutralizes the bacterial periplasm to provide a ph of approximately 6.2 and an inner membrane potential of -101 mv, giving a proton motive force of approximately -200 mv. urei is a six-transmembrane segment protein, with homology to the amis genes of the amidase gene cluster and to urei  of helicobacter hepaticus and streptococcus salivarius. expression of these urei  proteins in xenopus oocytes has shown that urei of h. pylori and h. hepaticus can transport urea only at acidic ph, whereas that of s. salivarius is open at both neutral and acidic ph. site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric analysis have identified amino acids implicated in maintaining the closed state of the channel  at neutral ph and other amino acids that play a structural role in channel function. deletion of urei abolishes the ability of the organism to survive in acid and also to colonize the mouse or gerbil stomach. however, if acid secretion is inhibited in gerbils, the deletion mutants do colonize but are eradicated when acid secretion is allowed to return, showing that urei is essential for gastric survival and that the habitat of h. pylori at the gastric surface must fall to ph 3.5 or below. the chronic response is from increased ni(2+) insertion into the apo-enzyme, which results in a threefold increase in urease, which is also dependent on expression of urei. this allows the organism to live in either gastric fundus or gastric antrum depending on the level of acidity at the gastric surface. there are other effects of acid on transcript stability that may alter levels of protein synthesis in acid. incubation of the organism at acidic ph also results in regulation of expression of a variety of genes, such as some outer membrane proteins, that constitutes an acid tolerance response. understanding of  these acid resistance and tolerance responses should provide novel eradication therapies for this carcinogenic gastric pathogen.

TI  == cis-acting elements that regulate the low-ph-inducible urease operon of streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == differential expression of the streptococcus salivarius 57.i urease operon in response to ph is effected by repression of transcription from a proximal promoter, purei: to localize the cis-acting elements involved in the regulation of the urease operon, the intact promoter region and its derivatives were generated and fused to a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene. the promoter-cat fusions were established in the lacz gene of s. salivarius by using a newly constructed integration vector. cat-specific activities were examined in batch-grown cells at ph 7.5 and 5.5. the results indicated that a 21  bp region immediately 5' to the -35 element was required for efficient repression of purei at neutral ph and that the 39 bp (-57 to -95) 5' to this region contained sequences required for optimal expression of purei: a potential secondary repressor-binding site was tentatively identified further upstream of the -35 element (-96 to -115). to further analyse the cis-acting elements, base changes were introduced into two at-rich repeats within the primary repressor-binding site. one such derivative, s. salivarius m1, with five base substitutions immediately 5' to the -35 element, expressed 20-fold more cat-specific activity at neutral ph than the strain carrying wild-type purei-cat. also, the ph sensitivity of strain m1 was greatly reduced, suggesting that this at-rich region is crucial for repression of the urease operon. deletion of three  consecutive 15- or 16-base segments from -52 to -96 in the s. salivarius m1 background resulted in lower activities compared to strain m1, confirming the presence of sequences required for optimal expression of the operon. all of the purei-cat fusions were also integrated into the gtfg gene of streptococcus gordonii dl1, a non-ureolytic oral streptococcus sp. repression of purei was observed at neutral ph in s. gordonii and the effects of the various mutations of the repressor-binding site largely paralleled those seen in s. salivarius, suggesting that the cis-elements may be a target for a global regulatory circuit  that controls gene expression in streptococci in response to ph.

AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == reevaluation of streptococcus bovis endocarditis cases from 1975 to 1985 by 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis.
AB  == studies that detected an association between streptococcus bovis endocarditis and colon carcinoma have not taken into account the recently identified genetic diversity among organisms historically classified as s. bovis. with near full-length 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis, organisms cultured from the blood of endocarditis patients at the mayo clinic from 1975 to 1985 and previously identified as s. bovis or streptococcus group d nonenterococci were shown to represent s. bovis biotypes i (11 isolates) and ii/2 (1 isolate), s. salivarius (1 isolate), and s. macedonicus (1 isolate). two of the s. bovis biotype i cases were associated with colon cancer. whether s. bovis biotype ii or other organisms closely related to and historically identified as s. bovis (e.g., s. macedonicus) are associated with malignant (or premalignant) colon lesions in  humans remains to be definitively determined.

TI  == groesl sequence determination, phylogenetic analysis, and species differentiation for viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the full-length sequences of the groesl genes (also known as cpn10/60) of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordonii, and  streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groesl genes of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius were determined. the lengths of the groes genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groel determined for  4 species (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. the intergenic region (spacer) between the groes and groel genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. the variation of the groes sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groel sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of  the 16s rrna gene. the intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. the groesl sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

TI  == effect of medium composition on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to mercuric chloride.
AB  == although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. in this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to hgcl(2) was investigated. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of hgcl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of mic values for hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. addition of blood increased the mic values, and some media (tryptone soya  agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between hg-sensitive and hg-resistant strains. the proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, columbia), but not on others (mueller-hinton, brain heart infusion, isosensitest). the mics of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), isosensitest agar, and columbia agar (with blood). mueller-hinton (without blood) appeared to  be the most suitable medium for isolating hg-resistant oral streptococci.

AB  == surface disinfection is a procedure carried out on the external parts of the dental equipment as well as on other items of the dental office. the aim of this  study was to analyze the efficacy of 4 surface disinfectants utilized in dentistry: 77 degrees gl alcohol, phenolic compound (duplofen), iodophor (pvp-i)  and 77 degrees gl alcohol with 5% of chlorhexidine. four surfaces of the equipment were analyzed in the study (the carter, the washbasin for hand-washing, the headrest of the chair and the external surface of the reflector), and the spray-wipe-spray procedure was carried out. from each surface, samples were collected by means of surface plates containing mitis salivarius bacitracin sucrose agar, sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol, macconkey agar and blood agar, for counting mutans streptococci, candida yeasts, gram-negative bacteria and total microorganisms, respectively (ufc/plate). the results were statistically analyzed by means of the student's t test in order to compare the mean ufc/plate values. the most effective disinfectant was 77 degrees gl alcohol  with 5% of chlorhexidine, mainly against gram-positive bacteria. iodophor and phenolic compound were also effective in microbial reduction. 77 degrees gl alcohol was the least effective product - however, although it is not considered  as a surface disinfectant, it produced, in this study, statistically significant  microbial reduction after the disinfecting procedure.

TI  == intracellular and extracellular phs of streptococcus mutans after addition of acids: loading and efflux of a fluorescent ph indicator in streptococcal cells.
AB  == a ph-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2', 7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 and 6-carboxyfluorescein (bcecf), was used to determine intracellular ph (ph(in)). the efflux of bcecf loaded into oral streptococcal cells was determined after incubation of the cells at 35 degrees c for 20 min in the presence and absence of glucose. in the absence of glucose, the fluorescence of intracellular bcecf in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sobrinus decreased only very slightly, indicating that the dye could be useful for ph(in) determination. in the presence of glucose, however, the fluorescence decreased by 57%. thus, the ph(in) of s. mutans cells was measured by the bcecf method in the absence of glucose at various acidic ph levels by adding lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids to the cell suspensions. the ph(in) was almost equal to the extracellular ph (ph(out)) for ph(out) values  of between 8 and 5, indicating that protons permeated easily across the s. mutans cell membrane. for ph(out) between 5 and 4, ph(in) was constant at around 5, suggesting that the cell membrane was impermeable to protons, or that a cytoplasmic buffering system functioned. ph(in) decreased at ph(out) values of <  4. the constant ph(in) at acidic ph(out) levels could protect intracellular components, such as proteins, against acidification by sugar fermentation.

TI  == susceptibility of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus to cell wall inhibitors and development of a novel selective medium for s. sobrinus.
AB  == representative strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus showed  differences in susceptibility to members of the monobactam group of beta-lactam antibiotics: s. sobrinus was less sensitive than s. mutans. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of aztreonam (azt) and carumonam, both of which belong  to this group, were 2,000 microg/ml for s. sobrinus and 125 microg/ml for s. mutans. further addition of fosfomycin, bacitracin and sodium chloride to mitis salivarius agar (ms) supplemented with azt resulted in growth inhibition of s. mutans and oral streptococci other than s. sobrinus, and was therefore used as a  selective medium for s. sobrinus (ms-sob medium). the average growth recovery of  laboratory and clinically isolated strains of s. sobrinus on ms-sob medium was 74.1% compared to that on ms medium. seventy-eight percent of clinical samples in which s. sobrinus was detected yielded pure growth of s. sobrinus on ms-sob medium.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == prevalent bacterial species and novel phylotypes in advanced noma lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in advanced noma lesions using culture-independent molecular methods. 16s ribosomal dna bacterial genes from dna isolated from advanced noma lesions of four nigerian children were pcr amplified with universally conserved primers and spirochetal selective primers and cloned into escherichia coli. partial 16s rrna sequences of approximately 500 bases from 212 cloned inserts were used initially to determine  species identity or closest relatives by comparison with sequences of known species or phylotypes. nearly complete sequences of approximately 1,500 bases were obtained for most of the potentially novel species. a total of 67 bacterial  species or phylotypes were detected, 25 of which have not yet been grown in vitro. nineteen of the species or phylotypes, including propionibacterium acnes,  staphylococcus spp., and the opportunistic pathogens stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ochrobactrum anthropi were detected in more than one subject. other known species that were detected included achromobacter spp., afipia spp., brevundimonas diminuta, capnocytophaga spp., cardiobacterium sp., eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium spp., gemella haemoylsans, and neisseria spp. phylotypes that were unique to noma infections included those in the genera eubacterium, flavobacterium, kocuria, microbacterium, and porphyromonas and the related streptococcus salivarius and genera sphingomonas and treponema: since advanced noma lesions are infections open to the environment, it was not surprising to detect species not commonly associated with the oral cavity, e.g., from soil. several species previously implicated as putative pathogens of noma, such as spirochetes and fusobacterium spp., were detected in at least one subject. however, due to the limited number of available noma subjects, it was not possible at this time to associate specific species with the disease.

TI  == comparison of five selective media for the growth and enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background: although a few growth media are available for selective isolation of  the cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), it is still unclear as to which is the most efficacious. this study compared the selectivity and sensitivity of five different media for growing a laboratory strain of s. mutans  (nctc 10449), and for enumerating s. mutans from teeth of a group of young children, aged 2-10 years. methods: the media tested in this study were mitis salivarius with bacitracin (msb), mitis salivariuskanamycin-bacitracin (mskb), glucose-sucrose-tellurite-bacitracin (gstb), trypticase soy-sucrose-bacitracin (tys20b) and tryptone-yeast-cysteine-sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agars. these were prepared according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. results: the results showed that at concentrations of bacteria 1 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(10)/ml, the recovery of the laboratory s. mutans strain was highest in tycsb agar, followed by in descending order by tys20b, msb, gstb, and mskb (p<0.01). similar results were obtained using dental plaque samples collected from swabs of the teeth of a  group of children. in the clinical samples, tycsb again showed the highest recovery rates of s. mutans compared to the other four media. results were reproduced at dilutions of the samples at 1:20 x 10(6) to 1:2 x 10(6), and s. mutans concentrations of 1.6 to 7.7 log 10 cfu/ml. in addition, there were highest ratios of mutans to non-mutans bacteria in tycsb compared to the other media, suggesting high selectivity of this media for mutans species. conclusion:  the results of our study suggest that tycsb is the most sensitive and selective media for culture of s. mutans for laboratory and clinical studies.

TI  == an essential amino acid residue for catalytic activity of the dextranase of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == dextranase (dex) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes glucan, a polymer of glucose synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferases (gtfs). by comparing amino acid  sequences of dexs and gtfs, we found that the dex enzymes of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus downei and streptococcus salivarius had similar amino acid sequences to those of the catalytic sites of gtfs of mutans streptococci. we therefore examined the amino acid essential in dex catalysis by molecular genetic approaches in this study. site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the asp-385 of the dex molecule of s. mutans ingbritt to glu, asn, thr or val. replacement of asp-385 with any of the amino acids resulted in complete disappearance of dex activity. however, replacement of other asp residues did not affect the enzyme activity. the inactive enzymes still retained dextran-binding ability. these results suggest that asp-385 of the dex of s. mutans ingbritt was essential for enzyme activity and the catalytic and substrate-binding sites were located at different sites within the dex molecule.

TI  == behavior of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus b producing a bacteriocin active against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644 and staphylococcus aureus sad 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. the bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that  of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs). although the cfs inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the  spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. l. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. the bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a bac- lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cy strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees c) or abuse (ca.  22 degrees c) temperature. yogurt samples were contaminated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/ml of milk, respectively. the results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against l. monocytogenes than against s. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. while l. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, s. aureus survived in bac+ and bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees c). use of a bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.

AB  == galactokinase and beta-galactosidase-deficient strains of streptococcus salivarius were constructed to define the pathways for lactose and galactose catabolism. it was found that s. salivarius does not possess a lactose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts), that intracellular lactose was hydrolyzed by beta-galactosidase, and that galactose is catabolized exclusively through the leloir pathway. the lack of a high-affinity pts for lactose may reflect the higher availability of the substrates to soft tissue organisms, such as s. salivarius, compared to dental plaque bacteria.

TI  == simulation modelling of bacterial growth in yoghurt.
AB  == indisim, an individual-based simulator, was used to specifically study the influence of the shape and size of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt processing. to this effect, two different sets of simulations were carried out. in the first set of simulations, it was assumed that the initial acidity of the medium has the same value as the acidity of the cytoplasm of the microorganisms. hence, the differences in bacterial growth by the two species are only attributable to differences in their geometry. it was found that, in an optimum culture, the growth in biomass of s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus is larger than that of l.  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. an important factor for understanding this difference might be the larger mass-to-surface ratio of the former. in the second set of simulations, a simplified model of yoghurt, the parametrisation differs both in the geometry and the metabolism of the two species. the results of these  simulations are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental data of  [lait 69 (1989) 519]. finally, by inhibiting the uptake of amino acids by s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus, the large relative importance of lactic acid in yoghurt processing was highlighted.

TI  == comparison of the activity of four chitosan derivatives in reducing initial adherence of oral bacteria onto tooth surfaces.
AB  == we examined the effects of four kinds of chitosan derivatives on initial adherence of oral bacteria onto human anterior teeth surfaces. the buccal surfaces of anterior teeth were used as the experimental surfaces. they were divided into five rectangle areas with outer dimensions of about 2 mm x 4 mm. after applying two ml of a sample solution onto the tooth surfaces, an examiner wiped each rectangle area with a sterilized plastic swab one, three and six hours later. then we measured bacterial counts in sterilized swabs with mitis salivarius agar. we found that the order of magnitude of the inhibitory effect on the adherence of oral bacteria was low molecular chitosan > phosphorylated chitosan > amorphous chitosan > carboxymethyl chitosan. the solution containing 0.5% low molecular chitosan depressed the bacterial adherence to the same extent  as a 50 ppm chlorhexidine digluconate solution for three hours, and 0.1% phosphorylated chitosan also exhibited an inhibitory effect in bacterial adherence for one hour. amorphous chitosan had a moderate inhibitory effect, but  no clear inhibitory activity was found with 0.1% carboxymethyl chitosan. these results suggest that low molecular chitosan and phosphorylated chitosan have the  potential to effectively inhibit the initial adherence of oral bacteria onto human tooth surfaces.

TI  == a clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic study of deep caries lesions after incomplete caries removal.
AB  == objective: clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic changes in deep caries lesions were assessed after incomplete carious dentin removal and tooth sealing.  method and materials: thirty-two teeth with deep caries lesions were studied. treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of calcium hydroxide, and sealing for a 6- to 7-month period. the color and consistency of the dentin were clinically assessed. differences in radiographic density were assessed by digital image subtraction. microbiologic samples were obtained from the demineralized dentin before the temporary sealing  and after the experimental period. the samples were cultivated on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar, and rogosa selective lactobacillus agar. results: two cases were lost during the study; one  presented pulpal necrosis. in the other case, there was pulpal exposure during removal of provisional sealing. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was soft and wet; one lesion was yellow, 21 were light brown, and eight were dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, and 80.00% of specimens were hard, 16.67% were leathery, and 3.33% remained soft. the dentin was light brown in five teeth and dark brown in 25. there was a statistically significant mean difference in radiographic density (pixel intensity), 88.77 +/- 7.02 in the control areas and 94.66 +/- 6.75 in the test areas. the counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci mutans had decreased significantly by the end of treatment. conclusion: incomplete removal of carious dentin and subsequent tooth sealing resulted in the arrest of the lesions, suggesting that complete dentinal caries lesion removal is not essential to the control of caries lesions.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == role of the c-terminal yg repeats of the primer-dependent streptococcal glucosyltransferase, gtfj, in binding to dextran and mutan.
AB  == the recombinant primer-dependent glucosyltransferase gtfj of streptococcus salivarius possesses a c-terminal glucan-binding domain composed of eighteen 21 aa yg repeats. by engineering a series of c-terminal truncated proteins, the position at which truncation prevented further mutan synthesis was defined to a region of 43 aa, confirming that not all of the yg motifs were required for the formation of mutan by gtfj. the role of the yg repeats in glucan binding was investigated in detail. three proteins consisting of 3.8, 7.2 or 11.0 c-terminal  yg repeats were expressed in escherichia coli. each of the three purified proteins bound to both the 1,6-alpha-linked glucose residues of dextran and the 1,3-alpha-linked glucose residues of mutan, indicating that a protein consisting  of nothing but 3.8 yg repeats could attach to either substrate. secondary structure predictions of the primary amino acid sequence suggested that 37% of the amino acids were capable of forming a structure such that five regions of beta-sheet were separated by regions capable of forming beta-turns and random coils. cd spectral analysis showed that the purified 3.8 yg protein possessed an  unordered secondary structure with some evidence of possible beta-sheet formation and that the protein maintained this relatively unordered structure on binding to dextran.

TI  == inhibitory effect of zncl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  == although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of zn on different organisms under both fixed ph and free-fall conditions. here, the effect of zncl(2) on streptococcus salivarius, strep. mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. ph-stat experiments were performed at ph 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; ph-fall experiments started at ph 7. in both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for zn and lactate determinations. under ph-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by zn most strongly in strep. sobrinus and strep. salivarius. in terms  of total acid production averted, however, the effect of zn under both ph-stat and ph-fall conditions was clearly greatest with strep. salivarius. a. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under ph-stat conditions. cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mm initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mm). packed cell layers responded to zn quite differently from suspensions, the ph often falling in the presence of 1mm zn at a rate similar to the no zn control. as streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both ph-stat and ph-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as a. naeslundii.

TI  == galactose and lactose genes from the galactose-positive bacterium streptococcus salivarius and the phylogenetically related galactose-negative bacterium streptococcus thermophilus: organization, sequence, transcription, and activity of the gal gene products.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a lactose- and galactose-positive bacterium that is phylogenetically closely related to streptococcus thermophilus, a bacterium that  metabolizes lactose but not galactose. in this paper, we report a comparative characterization of the s. salivarius and s. thermophilus gal-lac gene clusters.  the clusters have the same organization with the order galr (codes for a transcriptional regulator and is transcribed in the opposite direction), galk (galactokinase), galt (galactose-1-p uridylyltransferase), gale (udp-glucose 4-epimerase), galm (galactose mutarotase), lacs (lactose transporter), and lacz (beta-galactosidase). an analysis of the nucleotide sequence as well as northern  blotting and primer extension experiments revealed the presence of four promoters located upstream from galr, the gal operon, galm, and the lac operon of s. salivarius. putative promoters with virtually identical nucleotide sequences were found at the same positions in the s. thermophilus gal-lac gene cluster. an additional putative internal promoter at the 3' end of galt was found in s. thermophilus but not in s. salivarius. the results clearly indicated that the gal-lac gene cluster was efficiently transcribed in both species. the shine-dalgarno sequences of galt and gale were identical in both species, whereas the ribosome binding site of s. thermophilus galk differed from that of s. salivarius by two nucleotides, suggesting that the s. thermophilus galk gene might be poorly translated. this was confirmed by measurements of enzyme activities.

TI  == prediction of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus populations in yoghurt by curie point pyrolysis-mass spectrometry.
AB  == we evaluated the potential of pyrolysis-mass spectrometry (pyms) for quantifying  the binary mixed population of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in yoghurt. for this purpose, a new analytical approach was developed. the yoghurt was transparised and its total bacterial population was recovered by centrifugation and estimated by turbidimetric measurement. the quantity of each population (l. bulgaricus, s. thermophilus) was then estimated in the pellet by pyms, and the data were analysed by artificial neural networks (anns). in parallel, streptococci and lactobacilli were numerated on syl agar and these data were used as reference values to predict the bacterial counts of each population by pyms. a close correlation was established between the streptococci and the lactobacilli counts  on syl agar and pyms measurements (r(2)=0.98 for s. thermophilus and r(2)=0.96 for l. bulgaricus). combined turbidimetric measurement and pyms/anns seemed to be a powerful method for obtaining rapid counts of binary mixtures of bacteria in yoghurt.

TI  == [susceptibility to penicillin and 13 antimicrobial agents in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures].
AB  == from march 1998 to june 1999, we studied 63 sequential blood culture isolates of  viridans group streptococci which showed a 49% resistance to erythromycin. a high level of resistance to penicillin (46%) was also found. a statistically significant correlation was detected between the two types of resistance. the erythromycin-resistant strains were phenotypically and genotypically characterized, and no differences were found between the resistance to penicillin and the m or mls(b) phenotypes. the penicillin-erythromycin-resistant strains included: 16 s. mitis, five s. sanguis and one s. salivarius. the rank order of activity (% of susceptibility) for all 14 agents against 31 erythromycin- resistant isolates was the following: vancomycin = rifampicin (100) > chloramphenicol (98) > meropenem (65) > cefotaxime (61) > amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (42) > cefepime = ciprofloxacin (39) > tetracycline = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36) > cefuroxime (32) > penicillin = ampicillin =  cefaclor (29). the species s. milleri and s. bovis were the most susceptible. the most resistant strains were two s. mitis and one s. sanguis and showed multiresistance to six different groups of antimicrobial agents. the frequent association between macrolide resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents suggests that the susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates needs to be evaluated and alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of  viridans group streptococci infections should be identified.

TI  == vaccination with fima from streptococcus parasanguis protects rats from endocarditis caused by other viridans streptococci.
AB  == the fima protein of streptococcus parasanguis is a virulence factor in the rat model of endocarditis, and immunization with fima protects rats against homologous bacterial challenge. because fima-like proteins are widespread among the oral streptococci, the leading cause of native valve endocarditis, we evaluated the ability of this vaccinogen to protect rats when challenged by other streptococcal species. here we report that fima vaccination produced antibodies that cross-reacted with and protected against challenge by the oral streptococci  s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius. fima thus has promise as a vaccinogen to  control infective endocarditis caused by oral streptococci.

TI  == [typing of streptococcus mutans (serotype c) by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: to study the relationship between genetic diversity within streptococcus mutans (c), and dental caries. methods: one reference strain (gs5)  was used to establish the suitability of primers and the initial ap-pcr conditions. isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were obtained from 19 caries-free and 40 caries-active patients, and were originally isolated on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. totally 278 isolates were biochemically and serologically confirmed as streptococcus mutans (c). chromosomal dna was extracted from those isolates by chelex. one random primer, opa-05 was used as a  template in pcr reaction. all amplification reactions were conducted in a volume  of 20 microliters containing 2 microliters of 10 x reaction buffer, 200 mumol/l each of datp, dctp, dgtp and dttp and 2.5 units of taq dna polymerase. we varied  the concentrations of mgcl2 (1.5-4.5 mmol/l), template dna (2-40 ng), and primer  (0.3-0.5 mumol/l) to determine the optical conditions for ap-pcr. the temperature profile in a thermocycler was 35 cycles as follows: 94 degrees c for 1 min, at 36 degrees c for 2 min, at 72 degrees c for 2 min. the initial denaturation was at 94 degrees c for 5 min and the final extension at 72 degrees c for 5 min. results: the mgcl2 concentration in 4 mmol/l and the primer concentration in 0.5  mumol/l produced clearly distinct and reproducible fingerprints. we found 105 different patterns among the 278 isolates. in high-caries persons more than one genotype isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were colonized. conclusions: isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) exist apparent genetic diversity. the genotypes of isolates might relate to differences in caries susceptibility.

TI  == retention of oral microorganisms on conventional and resin-modified glass-ionomer cements.
AB  == secondary caries are a worldwide public and socioeconomic problem. the placement  of restorations can lead to the development of environmental conditions favorable to microbial colonization, especially on the tooth/restoration interface, which is a predisposing factor for secondary caries. the aim of this study was to evaluate microbial retention on conventional (chelon-fil and vidrion r) and resin-modified (vitremer and fuji ii lc) glass-ionomer cements, in situ, using a  hybrid composite resin (z100) as a control. twelve volunteers wore hawley appliances with specimens made of all tested filling materials for 7 days. the specimens were then removed from the appliances and transferred to tubes containing 2.0 ml of ringer-pras. microorganisms from the samples were inoculated onto blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and incubated under anaerobiosis (90% n2, 10% co2), at 37 degrees c, for 10 and 2 days, respectively. the resin-modified glass-ionomer cements and the composite resin retained the same levels of microorganisms on their surfaces. the resin-modified glass-ionomers retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin and conventional glass-ionomer cements. the conventional glass-ionomer cements retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin, but that difference was not statistically significant.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  == bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of  ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.

TI  == alteration of the coadherence of candida albicans with oral bacteria by dietary sugars.
AB  == interactions between bacterial oral flora and candida albicans are important in denture plaque formation. this study therefore first aimed to quantify the coadherence of c. albicans and bacteria by the use of a bioluminescent adenosine  triphosphate (atp) assay based on the firefly luciferase-luciferin system. the second aim was to examine the effect of i) dietary sugars (used for preculture) and ii) enzymatic digestion of fungi on the coadherence. when yeast was preincubated in yeast nitrogen base medium (ynb) supplemented with 250 mm glucose, the yeast coadhered with all isolates of streptoccus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, and no significant coadhesion was observed with the isolates of streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus and actinomyces. however, when the yeast was precultured in ynb supplemented with 500 mm galactose, the yeast coadhered with s. salivarius and actinomyces, which was not observed when the yeast was grown in ynb with glucose. in addition, the coadherence of the yeast with the isolates of s. sanguis was significantly reduced. enzymatic digestion of yeast and a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that expression of at least two types of proteinaceous adhesins are involved in these phenomena.

AB  == national and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. in venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some  commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. this research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. for this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. the  different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. these samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of ph and acidity. the absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. the succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. the data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.

TI  == diversity of streptococcus salivarius ptsh mutants that can be isolated in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose and galactose and characterization of two mutants synthesizing reduced levels of hpr, a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system.
AB  == in streptococci, hpr, a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts), undergoes multiple posttranslational chemical modifications resulting in the formation of hpr(his approximately p), hpr(ser-p), and hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p), whose cellular concentrations vary with growth conditions. distinct physiological functions are associated with specific forms of hpr. we do not know, however, the cellular thresholds below which these forms become unable to fulfill their functions and to what extent modifications in the cellular concentrations of the different forms of hpr modify cellular physiology. in this study, we present a glimpse of the diversity of streptococcus salivarius ptsh mutants that can be isolated by positive selection  on a solid medium containing 2-deoxyglucose and galactose and identify 13 amino acids that are essential for hpr to properly accomplish its physiological functions. we also report the characterization of two s. salivarius mutants that  produced approximately two- and threefoldless hpr and enzyme i (ei) respectively. the data indicated that (i) a reduction in the synthesis of hpr due to a mutation in the shine-dalgarno sequence of ptsh reduced ptsi expression; (ii) a threefold  reduction in ei and hpr cellular levels did not affect pts transport capacity; (iii) a twofold reduction in hpr synthesis was sufficient to reduce the rate at which cells metabolized pts sugars, increase generation times on pts sugars and to a lesser extent on non-pts sugars, and impede the exclusion of non-pts sugars  by pts sugars; (iv) a threefold reduction in hpr synthesis caused a strong derepression of the genes coding for alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, and galactokinase when the cells were grown at the expense of a pts sugar but did not affect the synthesis of alpha-galactosidase when cells were grown at the expense  of lactose, a noninducing non-pts sugar; and (v) no correlation was found between the magnitude of enzyme derepression and the cellular levels of hpr(ser-p).

AB  == while a gutta-percha system is most commonly used by practitioners for canal obturation, there is no agreement on how best to close the chamber of an endodontically treated tooth. some materials used in restorative dentistry may have endodontic applications. restorative materials of particular interest to endodontists are those used as subgingival restorations. their properties include insolubility in oral fluids, adhesiveness, dual-cure capabilities, radiopacity, hardness and fluoride release, low cure shrinkage and a low coefficient of thermal expansion. the purpose of this in vitro study was to test three products  that could be used to seal pulp chambers of endodontically treated teeth to prevent bacterial infiltration. a bacteriological assay system was used to determine the efficacy of three commercially available restorative materials to prevent penetration of streptococcus salivarius from the pulp chambers into the prepared canals. the materials evaluated were: geristore two-paste system with tenure quik with fluoride, dispersalloy with tenure quik with fluoride, and marathon posterior composite with tenure quik with fluoride. during the sixty days of the study, the analysis indicated that the geristore two-paste system with tenure quik with fluoride provided a statistically significant improved seal when compared to the marathon posterior composite and dispersalloy amalgam with tenure quik with fluoride.

TI  == sites of ph regulation of the urea channel of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == helicobacter pylori (hp) and streptococcus salivarius (ss) require intrabacterial urease for acid resistance and express a urea channel, urei. the presence of urei was shown to increase urea permeability approximately 300-fold over that of a non-polar urei deletion mutant. expression of ssurei in xenopus oocytes increased urea uptake ph independently, whereas hpurei shows an acidic ph dependence, half-maximal at ph 6.0. mutagenesis of all histidines, aspartates, glutamates and the lysine in the periplasmic domain of hpurei showed that his-123, his-131, asp-129, asp-140, glu-138 and lys-132 in the second periplasmic loop (pl2) and his-193 in the c-terminus (ct) were important for activation of transport. with the exception of a lysine that was shown to substitute for his-193 in hpurei, these charged amino acids are absent in ssurei. a chimera in which pl1 of hpurei  was replaced by pl1 of ssurei retained activity at acidic ph and gained partial activity at neutral ph. exchange of pl2 inactivated transport, whereas exchange of ct had no effect. chimeras, in which either pl1 or pl2 of hpurei replaced those of ssurei, retained wild-type transport, but replacement of the ct or both  loops inactivated transport. pl1 appears to be important for restricting transport through hpurei at neutral ph, whereas protonation of three histidines in pl2 and ct and the presence of three dicarboxylic amino acids in pl2 appears to be necessary to activate hpurei at acidic ph.

TI  == inhibitory effects of moabs against a surface protein antigen in real-time adherence in vitro and recolonization in vivo of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

AB  == objective: to evaluate if the extent of normal microflora disturbances differed between treatment with amoxycillin-clavulanate administered in an active form and cefuroxime axetil administered as an inactive prodrug. methods: twenty-eight children, 0.5-5 years old, diagnosed with acute otitis media (aom), were treated  with either amoxycillin-clavulanate (13.3 mg/kg 3 times daily) or cefuroxime axetil (15 mg/kg twice daily) for 7 days. saliva samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected before, directly after and 2 weeks after treatment. the saliva samples were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed and the nasopharyngeal swabs were qualitatively analyzed. all isolated strains were tested for beta-lactamase production. results: both treatment regimens gave rise to similar  alterations of the normal oropharyngeal microflora. in both groups, the amount of streptococcus salivarius was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). the most common causative pathogens of acute otitis were s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. on the day of enrollment, approximately half of the patients, in both groups, were infected with more than one pathogen. the rate of  infection or colonization with more than one potential pathogen was low on day 7  but recurred 2 weeks after treatment to similar levels as on day 0. the total number of patients with reinfection, recolonization or recurrence of pathogens on day 21 was 11/12 in the amoxycillin-clavulanate group and 4/7 in the cefuroxime axetil group. the most common beta-lactamase producer was m. catarrhalis. conclusion: the local high concentration of antibiotics in the oropharynx immediately after intake of antibiotic suspensions seem to have little or no impact on the extent of disturbance of the microflora in this region. children of this age group seem prone to either reinfection, recolonization or persistence of pathogens within 2 weeks after treatment. furthermore, co-infection with more than one pathogen seems common in children with aom and infection with beta-lactamase producing microorganisms occurs frequently.

TI  == intra- and interspecies signaling between streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes mediated by sala and sala1 lantibiotic peptides.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius 20p3 produces a 22-amino-acid residue lantibiotic, designated salivaricin a (sala), that inhibits the growth of a range of streptococci, including all strains of streptococcus pyogenes. lantibiotic production is associated with the sal genetic locus comprising sala, the lantibiotic structural gene; salbctx genes encoding peptide modification and export machinery proteins; and salykr genes encoding a putative immunity protein  and two-component sensor-regulator system. insertional inactivation of salb in s. salivarius 20p3 resulted in abrogation of sala peptide production, of immunity to sala, and of sala transcription. addition of exogenous sala peptide to salb mutant cultures induced dose-dependent expression of sala mrna (0.2 kb), demonstrating that sala production was normally autoregulated. inactivation of salr encoding the response regulator of the salkr two-component system led to reduced production of, and immunity to, sala. the sal genetic locus was also present in s. pyogenes sf370 (m type 1), but because of a deletion across the salbct genes, the corresponding lantibiotic peptide, designated sala1, was not produced. however, in s. pyogenes t11 (m type 4) the sal locus gene complement was apparently complete, and active sala1 peptide was synthesized. exogenously added sala1 peptide from s. pyogenes t11 induced sala1 transcription in s. pyogenes sf370 and in an isogenic s. pyogenes t11 salb mutant and sala transcription in s. salivarius 20p3 salb. thus, sala and sala1 are examples of streptococcal lantibiotics whose production is autoregulated. these peptides act  as intra- and interspecies signaling molecules, modulating lantibiotic production and possibly influencing streptococcal population ecology in the oral cavity.

AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on mother-child transmission of mutans  streptococci: 6-year follow-up.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a noncariogenic or even cariostatic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) which shed easily into saliva from plaque. we have earlier shown that habitual xylitol  consumption of mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction  in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at 2 years of age. the aim of the present study was to assess the children's ms counts 1 and 4 years after the maternal xylitol consumption had been discontinued. at baseline, during pregnancy, all mothers (n = 195) showed high salivary levels of ms. the mothers were randomly assigned to xylitol, fluoride (f) and chlorhexidine (chx) groups. in the xylitol group, the mothers chewed xylitol-sweetened gum, for 21 months, starting 3 months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received chx or f varnish treatments at 6, 12 and 18 months after delivery. at the 2-year  examination, 169 mother-child pairs participated. at the 3-year and 6-year examinations, there were 159 and 147 children in the study, respectively. for children's ms analyses, visible plaque was collected using toothpicks at the age  of 3 and paraffin-stimulated saliva at the age of 6. the persons involved in the  collection and analysis of the microbiological samples were blinded as to the study design and group. both the plaque and salivary ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. in all groups, the colonization percentages increased during the follow-up. at the 3-year examination, the children's risk of having ms colonization was 2.3-fold in the f group (95% ci 1.3-4.2) compared to the xylitol group. this difference was statistically significant. even at 6 years of age, the salivary ms levels were significantly lower in the xylitol group than in the other groups (anova, p<0.001). in conclusion, the earlier demonstrated, xylitol-associated reduction in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms was still found in the children's  ms counts at the age of 3 and 6 years.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius fimbriae are composed of a glycoprotein containing a repeated motif assembled into a filamentous nondissociable structure.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius, a gram-positive bacterium found in the human oral cavity, expresses flexible peritrichous fimbriae. in this paper, we report purification and partial characterization of s. salivarius fimbriae. fimbriae were extracted by shearing the cell surface of hyperfimbriated mutant a37 (a spontaneous mutant of s. salivarius atcc 25975) with glass beads. preliminary experiments showed that s. salivarius fimbriae did not dissociate when they were  incubated at 100 degrees c in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. this characteristic was used to separate them from other cell surface components by successive gel filtration chromatography procedures. fimbriae with molecular masses ranging from 20 x 10(6) to 40 x 10(6) da were purified. examination of purified fimbriae by electron microscopy revealed the presence of filamentous structures up to 1 microm long and 3 to 4 nm in diameter. biochemical studies of  purified fimbriae and an amino acid sequence analysis of a fimbrial internal peptide revealed that s. salivarius fimbriae were composed of a glycoprotein assembled into a filamentous structure resistant to dissociation. the internal amino acid sequence was composed of a repeated motif of two amino acids alternating with two modified residues: a/x/t-e-q-m/phi, where x represents a modified amino acid residue and phi represents a blank cycle. immunolocalization  experiments also revealed that the fimbriae were associated with a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive carbohydrate. immunolabeling experiments with antifimbria polyclonal antibodies showed that antigenically related fimbria-like structures were expressed in two other human oral streptococcal species, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus constellatus.

TI  == acetaldehyde production and other adh-related characteristics of aerobic bacteria isolated from hypochlorhydric human stomach.
AB  == background: acetaldehyde is a known local carcinogen in the digestive tract in humans. bacterial overgrowth in the hypochlorhydric stomach enhances production of acetaldehyde from ethanol in vivo after alcohol ingestion. therefore, microbially produced acetaldehyde may be a potential risk factor for alcohol-related gastric and cardiac cancers. this study was aimed to investigate  which bacterial species and/or groups are responsible for acetaldehyde formation  in the hypochlorhydric human stomach and to characterize their alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) enzymes. methods: after 7 days of treatment with 30 mg of lansoprazole twice a day, a gastroscopy was performed on eight volunteers to obtain hypochlorhydric gastric juice. samples were cultured and bacteria were isolated and identified; thereafter, their acetaldehyde production capacity was measured gas chromatographically by incubating intact bacterial suspensions with  ethanol at 37 degrees c. cytosolic adh activities, km values, and protein concentration were determined spectrophotometrically. results: acetaldehyde production of the isolated bacterial strains (n = 51) varied from less than 1 to  13,690 nmol of acetaldehyde/10(9) colony-forming units/hr. adh activity of the strains that produced more than 100 nmol of acetaldehyde/10(9) colony-forming units/hr (n = 23) varied from 3.9 to 1253 nmol of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide per minute per milligram of protein, and km values for ethanol ranged from 0.65 to 116 mm and from 0.5 to 3.1 m (high km). there was a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.64, p < 0.001) between adh activity  and acetaldehyde production from ethanol in the tested strains. the most potent acetaldehyde producers were neisseria and rothia species and streptococcus salivarius, whereas nearly all stomatococcus, staphylococcus, and other streptococcus species had a very low capacity to produce acetaldehyde. conclusions: this study demonstrated that certain bacterial species or groups that originate from the oral cavity are responsible for the bulk of acetaldehyde  production in the hypochlorhydric stomach. these findings provide new information with the respect to the local production of carcinogenic acetaldehyde in the upper digestive tract of achlorhydric human subjects.

TI  == oral colonization and cariogenicity of streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free tan:spfom(om)br rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  == the significance of streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (abb) commonly found in the mouth. to clarify the ecological and cariological roles of s. gordonii our specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats, tan:spfom(om)br, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000cs (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with  s. gordonii strains. uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (ms) and abb, including s. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. abb were detected by radiochemical assay using [125i]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of  the surface of s. gordonii and other abb. no abb were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). thus the tan:spfom(om)br colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. consequently, s. gordonii strains challis or g9b were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000cs. two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of abb and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000cs had s. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. there were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, p < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either challis (1.41-fold) or g9b (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both p < 0.001, so long as  the rats ate the sucrose diet. therefore, tan:spfom(om)br rats do not harbour abb or s. gordonii but can be colonized by s. gordonii. colonization levels of s. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by s gordonii colonization. s. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == regulation of urease gene expression by streptococcus salivarius growing in biofilms.
AB  == the metabolism of urea by urease enzymes of oral bacteria profoundly influences oral biofilm ph homeostasis and oral microbial ecology. the purpose of this study was to gain insight into the regulation of expression of the low ph-inducible urease genes in populations of streptococcus salivarius growing in vitro in biofilms and to explore whether urease regulation or the levels of urease expression in biofilm cells differed significantly from planktonic cells. two strains of s. salivarius harbouring urease promoter fusions to a chloramphenicol  acetyltransferase (cat) gene were used: purelcat, containing a fusion to the full-length, ph-sensitive promoter; or pureldelta100cat, a constitutively derepressed deletion derivative of the urease gene promoter. the strains were grown in a rototorque biofilm reactor in a tryptone-yeast extract-sucrose medium  with or without ph control. both cat and urease activities in biofilms were measured at 'quasi-steady state' and after a 25mm glucose pulse. the results showed that cat expression in purelcat was repressed at relatively neutral ph values, and that expression could be induced by acidic ph after carbohydrate challenge. biofilms of purelcat grown at low ph, without buffering, had about 20-fold higher cat levels, and only a modest further induction could be elicited  with carbohydrate pulsing. the levels of cat in biofilms of purelcat grown in buffered medium were slightly higher than those reported for planktonic cells cultured at ph 7.0, and the levels of cat in purel-cat growing at low ph or after induction were similar to those reported for fully induced planktonic cells. cat  activity in pureldelta100cat was constitutively high, regardless of growth conditions. interestingly, urease activity detected in biofilms of the parent strain, s. salivarius 57.1, could be as much as 130-fold higher than that reported for fluid chemostat cultures grown under similar conditions. the higher  level of urease activity in biofilms was probably caused by the accumulation of the stable urease enzyme within biofilm cells, low ph microenvironments and the growth phase of populations of cells in the biofilm. the ability of s. salivarius biofilm cells to upregulate urease expression in response to ph gradients and to  accumulate greater quantities of urease enzyme when growing in biofilms may have  a significant impact on oral biofilm ph homeostasis and microbial ecology in vivo. additionally, s. salivarius carrying the ph-sensitive urease gene promoter  fused to an appropriate reporter gene may be a useful biological probe for sensing biofilm ph in situ.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == automated fluorescent in situ hybridization for the specific detection and quantification of oral streptococci in dental plaque.
AB  == our aim was to develop a rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the identification of different oral groups of streptococci in dental plaque and  to combine it with digital image analysis for the automated enumeration of target cells. cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for 16s rrna gene sequences of the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups of streptococci were hybridized under stringent conditions with bacterial cultures or supragingival plaque samples that had been permeabilized with lysozyme. probe specificity was determined with strains from 30 different species, mainly of oral origin. results showed that probes ang541, mit447, ssp001, and sal090 with specificity for the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups, respectively, the pan-reactive streptococcal probe str405, the s. mutans specific probe mut590, and the s. sobrinus specific probe sob174 were well-suited for the identification of cultured streptococci. probes str405, mit447 and ssp001 were then successfully applied to enumerate automatically bacteria of the recognized taxa in 144 supragingival plaque samples. on the average, total streptococci accounted for 8.2%, streptococci of the mitis and mutans groups for 3.9 and 1.7%, respectively, of the plaques. the combined application of fish and automated image analysis provides an objective time-saving alternative to culture or pcr for the enumeration of selected oral streptococci in dental plaque.

AB  == this study attempted to determine which combination of plaque or saliva, and tryptic soy agar, bacitracin (tsy20b) or mitis salivarius, bacitracin media, yielded the highest caries-predictive values for mutans counts in children with different caries prevalence. sixty children were divided into three equally sized groups: caries free, low caries and high caries. eighteen months later, their caries incidence and initial mutans count were compared. fissure plaque on tsy20b yielded a high correlation between mutans counts and caries prevalence (p<0.009,  r=3346) and incidence (p<0.003, r=4521). the caries-predictive values obtained demonstrate that the coefficient of variation of mutans counts from lower first-molar fissure plaque on tsy20b accounts for 20.4% of the variation in final caries index. this strong correlation provides a valuable tool for the identification of caries-prone individuals.

TI  == suppression of urease levels in streptococcus salivarius by cysteine, related compounds and by sulfide.
AB  == urease synthesis in streptococcus salivarius is induced by an acid environment, carbohydrate and a high growth rate. we now report that both cysteine and sulfide above 1 mm strongly suppress s. salivarius urease levels. close structural relatives of cysteine (cysteamine, ethanedithiol and penicillamine) at 5 mm buffered to ph 7.0 also caused urease suppression, but thiols in general (2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol and glutathione) did not. in cultures buffered below ph 5.9, the cysteine-induced urease suppression was lifted substantially, but the sulfide suppression increased, suggesting involvement of different processes. urease activity was inhibited 50% by 5 mm mercaptoethanol but unaffected by 5 mm cysteine or sulfide, hence modification of enzyme activity by  thiols is not directly related to suppression of their levels in culture. cysteine, arising primarily through protein hydrolysis which also raises the ph,  could be a surrogate ph feedback signal for nearby alkaline conditions, and sulfide may reflect activity of periodontopathic plaques.

TI  == abiotrophia species in early dental plaque.
AB  == the most characteristic traits that distinguish abiotrophia strains from other streptococci are nutrient requirements, satellitism and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase  activity. the presence of abiotrophia strains was studied in early dental plaque  formed on sucrose-containing and sucrose-free (glucose-containing) diets. the isolates were from 0- to 3-day dental plaque formed on the buccal surface of a lower premolar in six subjects. identification of abiotrophia strains was based on their pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity. they were among the predominant cultivable microorganisms isolated from diluted suspensions of early dental plaque formed on both diets. using biochemical tests without testing for pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity, the abiotrophia strains would be biochemically identified as streptococcus mitis or unidentified streptococci, and many isolates first classified as unidentified streptococci were abiotrophia strains. generally, identifications using partial 16s rrna sequences confirmed the identifications obtained biochemically. however, abiotrophia elegans and gemella  strains were biochemically identified as abiotrophia adiacens. abiotrophia strains produce hydrogen sulfide, which may influence the metabolism and ecology  of dental plaque and act as a virulence factor in periodontal disease. they are not able to grow on tryptic soy agar. in the present study, some s. mitis strains were not able to grow on mitis salivarius agar, and some abiotrophia strains were able to grow on this medium. these observations indicate that the use of these media for estimation of total viable counts and number of streptococci introduces systematic error in studies of microorganisms in dental plaque.

AB  == deposition to glass of streptococcus salivarius hb-c12 and staphylococcus epidermidis 3399 in a parallel plate flow chamber has been studied as a function  of ionic strength. electrophoretic mobility measurements revealed that s. epidermidis 3399 possesses a thick ion-penetrable layer, probably associated with its encapsulation, while s. salivarius hb-c12 has an ion-impenetrable surface. streaming potential measurements indicated that also the glass surface was covered with a relatively thin, ion-penetrable layer. theoretical initial deposition rates of both strains to glass were obtained by numerically solving the convective-diffusion equation, while accounting for the ion-penetrability of  the interacting surfaces. experimentally, the initial deposition rate of the ion-penetrable strain s. epidermidis 3399 was found to be higher and less dependent on ionic strength than of the ion-impenetrable s. salivarius hb-c12, in accordance with theoretical expectations. agreement between theoretical and experimental deposition rates could be obtained when glass was considered ion-penetrable when interacting with the ion-penetrable organism s. epidermidis 3399, while glass behaved as an ion-impenetrable surface when interacting with the ion-impenetrable s. salivarius hb-c12. probably, interaction with an ion-impenetrable strain drives the diffuse double layer charges into the limited  volume of the thin ion-penetrable layer on the glass, readily filling it up and making it appear ion-impenetrable. during interaction of glass with another ion-penetrable surface, as of s. epidermidis 3399, diffuse double layer charges move into both ion-penetrable surfaces, resulting in a much lower mobile charge density in the ion-penetrable layer on the glass which consequently continues to  behave as ion-penetrable.

TI  == regulation of the pts operon in low g+c gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the sugar transport system called phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase (pts) is widespread among eubacteria. its is generally composed of two cytoplasmic proteins, hpr and el, which are found in all bacteria possessing a pts, and a family of ells whose number, specificity, and molecular structure in terms of domain arrangement vary from species to species. in low g+c gram-positive bacteria, the genes coding for the general proteins hpr and el, designated ptsh and ptsl respectively, are organized into the pts operon. in this paper, we summarize current knowledge about the regulation of the pts operon in low g+c gram-positive bacteria. physiological data indicate that el and most particularly hpr make up a substantial proportion of cellular proteins. their synthesis is not coordinated and is influenced by environmental factors. the principal dna cis-elements involved in the regulation of pts operon transcription are a strong promoter whose sequence and structure are very similar to those of the canonical promoter recognized by the escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis major rna polymerases, a 5'-untranslated region, a rho-dependent terminator located at the 5' end of ptsl, and an intrinsic terminator located downstream from ptsl. analysis of ptsh and ptsl shine-dalgarno sequences as well as experimental results obtained with a streptococcus salivarius mutant suggest that the expression of hpr and el is also controlled at the translation level.

AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == mutans streptococci prevalence in puerto rican babies with cariogenic feeding behaviors.
AB  == purpose: previous studies have demonstrated that babies are at higher risk for mutans streptococci (ms) colonization if their mothers have dense salivary ms reservoirs relative to babies who have mothers with negligible salivary reservoirs. this communication provides data that identifies another potential risk factor (use of a nursing bottle at bedtime and/or naptime that contains a substrate other than water) for baby infection by ms. methods: the study population consisted of 60 babies (28 males/32 females; mean age 15 mos; age range 12-18 mos) who were all healthy, caries free, and slept with a nursing bottle that contained a substrate other than water (nb+). pooled maxillary incisor plaque and saliva samples were obtained and immediately placed in reduced transparent fluid (rtf); they were serially diluted and plated onto mitis salivarius agar plus bacitracin (msb) and blood agar plates within 4 hours of collection; the plates were incubated in an anaerobic environment for 48 h at 37  c and then placed for 24 h under aerobiosis prior to examination; representative  ms colonies were isolated and subjected to mannitol and sorbitol fermentation tests for taxonomic verification. plates with colony counts between 20 and 300 were utilized to determine the % of ms in each sample. results: fifty one of the  60(85%) babies harbored ms in at least 1 of the 2 samples. the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of ms was 73%-93%. fisher's exact test showed that babies 16-18 mos age were more likely to have detectable levels of ms than babies 12-15 mos age (p = 0.01). levels of ms in plaque and saliva were as follows: < 0.1% (plaque 27/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.77; saliva 28/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.76); 0.1%-1.0% (plaque 4/51, mean age 14 mos, sd 1.5; saliva 6/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.46); > 1.0% (plaque 14/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 2.1; saliva 11/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 1.91). the density of  infection did not vary by age for plaque (p = 0.32) or saliva (p = 0.64). conclusion: these findings support the concept that nb+ is a strong indicator for ms infection in puerto rican babies; that prevalence of infection increases with  age; and that density of infection does not vary with age in this population.

TI  == oral bacteriotherapy as maintenance treatment in patients with chronic pouchitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == background & aims: pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. most patients have relapsing disease, and no maintenance treatment study has been performed. we evaluated the  efficacy of a probiotic preparation (vsl#3) containing 5 x 10(11) per gram of viable lyophilized bacteria of 4 strains of lactobacilli, 3 strains of bifidobacteria, and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus compared with placebo in maintenance of remission of chronic pouchitis. methods:  forty patients in clinical and endoscopic remission were randomized to receive either vsl#3, 6 g/day, or an identical placebo for 9 months. patients were assessed clinically every month and endoscopically and histologically every 2 months or in the case of a relapse. fecal samples were collected for stool culture before and after antibiotic treatment and each month during maintenance treatment. results: three patients (15%) in the vsl#3 group had relapses within the 9-month follow-up period, compared with 20 (100%) in the placebo group (p < 0.001). fecal concentration of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and s. thermophilus  increased significantly from baseline levels only in the vsl#3-treated group (p < 0.01). conclusions: these results suggest that oral administration of this new probiotic preparation is effective in preventing flare-ups of chronic pouchitis.

TI  == genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis and distinct aciduric subpopulations in human dental plaque.
AB  == the genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis isolated from the oral cavity was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. unrelated subjects  harbored unique genotypes, with numerous genotypes being isolated from an individual. s. oralis is the predominant aciduric bacterium isolated from noncarious tooth sites. genotypic comparison of the aciduric populations isolated at ph 5.2 with those isolated from mitis-salivarius agar (msa) (ph 7.0) indicated that the aciduric populations were genotypically distinct in the majority of subjects (chi(2) = 13.09; p = 0.0031). neither the aciduric nor the msa-isolated  strains were stable, with no strains isolated at baseline being isolated 4 or 12  weeks later in the majority of subjects. the basis of this instability is unknown but is similar to that reported for streptococcus mitis. examination of s. oralis strains isolated from cohabiting couples demonstrated that in three of five couples, genotypically identical strains were isolated from both partners and this was confirmed by using salmonella enteritidis repetitive element pcr and enterobacterial pcr typing. these data provide further evidence of the physiological and genotypic heterogeneity of non-mutans streptococci. the demonstration of distinct aciduric populations of s. oralis implies that the role of these and other non-mutans streptococci in the caries process requires reevaluation.

TI  == low frequency of bacteremia after endoscopic mucosal resection.
AB  == background: endoscopic mucosal resection has become a popular alternative for the treatment of early-stage neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract. however, there  are still no data on the frequency of bacteremia associated with this form of treatment. methods: we conducted a prospective study of 21 men and 17 women undergoing endoscopic mucosal resection with a cap-fitted panendoscope for upper  gastrointestinal lesions. blood cultures were performed before, 10 minutes after, and 4 hours after the procedure for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. results: blood culture at baseline was negative in all the patients. two of 38 patients (5.3 %) had positive blood culture at 10 minutes after the procedure. the isolated microorganisms were streptococcus salivarius and corynebacterium species. all patients had negative blood cultures 4 hours later. none of these 38 patients had any symptoms or signs associated with infection. conclusions: bacteremia associated with endoscopic mucosal resection is infrequent and transient.

TI  == adaptation of oral streptococci to low ph.
AB  == the strategies employed by oral streptococci to resist the inimical influences of acidification reflect the diverse and dynamic niches of the human mouth. all of the oral streptococci are capable of rapid degradation of sugar to acidic end-products. as a result, the ph value of their immediate environment can plummet to levels where glycolysis and growth cease. at this point, the approaches for survival in acid separate the organisms. streptococcus mutans, for example, relies on its f-atpase, to protect itself from acidification by pumping  protons out of the cells. s. salivarius responds by degrading urea to ammonia and s. sanguis produces ammonia by arginolysis. the mechanisms by which these organisms regulate their particular escape route are now being explored experimentally. the picture that emerges is that the acid-adaptive regulatory mechanisms of the oral streptococci differ markedly from those employed by gram-negative bacteria. what remains to be elucidated are the breadth of the acid-response systems in these organisms and how they permit the microbes to sustain themselves in the face of low ph and the bacterial competition present in their respective niches. in this article, we summarize reports concerning the means by which oral streptococci either utilize acidification to subdue their competitors or protect themselves until ph values return to a more favorable level.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == inactivation of the ptsi gene encoding enzyme i of the sugar phosphotransferase system of streptococcus salivarius: effects on growth and urease expression.
AB  == the urease genes of streptococcus salivarius 57.1 are tightly repressed in cells  growing at neutral ph. when cells are cultivated at acidic ph values, the urease  genes become derepressed and transcription is enhanced when cells are growing under carbohydrate-excess conditions. previously, the authors proposed that the bacterial sugar:phosphotransferase system (pts) modulated the dna-binding activity by phosphorylation of the urease repressor when carbohydrate was limiting. the purpose of this study was to assess whether enzyme i (ei) of the pts could be involved in modulating urease expression in response to carbohydrate availability. an ei-deficient strain (ptsi18-3) of s. salivarius 57.1 was constructed by insertional inactivation of the ptsi gene. the mutant had no measurable pts activity and lacked ei, as assessed by western analysis. the mutant grew as well as the wild-type strain on the non-pts sugar lactose, and grew better than the parent when another non-pts sugar, galactose, was the sole carbohydrate. the mutant was able to grow with glucose as the sole carbohydrate,  but displayed a 24 h lag time and had a generation time some threefold longer than strain 57.1. the mean od600 attained after 48 h by ptsi18-3 supplied with fructose was 0.16, with no additional growth observed even after 3 d. urease expression in the wild-type and mutant strains was assessed in continuous chemostat culture. repression of urease at neutral ph was seen in both strains under all conditions tested. growth of wild-type cells on limiting concentrations of lactose resulted in very low levels of urease expression compared with growth  on pts sugars. in contrast, under similar conditions, urease expression in ptsi18-3 was restored to levels seen in the parent growing on pts sugars. growth  under conditions of lactose excess resulted in further derepression of urease, but ptsi18-3 expressed about threefold higher urease activity than 57.1. the results support a role for ei in urease regulation, but also indicate that additional factors may be important in regulating urease gene expression.

AB  == in this paper, direct measurement by atomic force microscopy (afm) of the cell surface softness of a fibrillated oral streptococcal strain streptococcus salivarius hb and of a nonfibrillated strain s. salivarius hbc12 is presented, and the data interpretation is validated by comparison with results from independent techniques. upon approach of the fibrillated strain in water, the afm tip experienced a long-range repulsion force, starting at approximately 100 nm, attributed to the compression of the soft layer of fibrils present at the cell surface. in 0.1 m kcl, repulsion was only experienced when the tip was closer than approximately 10 nm, reflecting a stiffer cell surface due to collapse of the fibrillar mass. force-distance curves indicated that the nonfibrillated strain, probed both in water and in 0.1 m kcl, was much stiffer than the fibrillated strain in water, and a repulsion force was experienced by the tip at  close approach only (20 nm in water and 10 nm in 0.1 m kcl). differences in cell  surface softness were further supported by differences in cell surface morphology, the fibrillated strain imaged in water being the only specimen that showed characteristic topographical features attributable to fibrils. these results are in excellent agreement with previous indirect measurements of cell surface softness by dynamic light scattering and particulate microelectrophoresis and demonstrate the potential of afm to directly probe the softness of microbial  cell surfaces.

TI  == characterization of recombinant, ureolytic streptococcus mutans demonstrates an inverse relationship between dental plaque ureolytic capacity and cariogenicity.
AB  == dental caries results from prolonged plaque acidification that leads to the establishment of a cariogenic microflora and demineralization of the tooth. urease enzymes of oral bacteria hydrolyze urea to ammonia, which can neutralize plaque acids. to begin to examine the relationship between plaque ureolytic activity and the incidence of dental caries, recombinant, ureolytic strains of streptococcus mutans were constructed. specifically, the ureabcefgd operon from streptococcus salivarius 57.i was integrated into the s. mutans chromosome in such a way that the operon was transcribed from a weak, cognate promoter in s. mutans acus4 or a stronger promoter in s. mutans acus6. both strains expressed nicl(2)-dependent urease activity, but the maximal urease levels in acus6 were threefold higher than those in acus4. in vitro ph drop experiments demonstrated that the ability of the recombinant s. mutans strains to moderate a decrease in ph during the simultaneous metabolism of glucose and urea increased proportionately with the level of urease activity expressed. specific-pathogen-free rats that were infected with acus6 and fed a cariogenic diet with drinking water containing 25 mm urea and 50 microm nicl(2) had relatively high levels of oral urease activity, as well as dramatic decreases in  the prevalence of smooth-surface caries and the severity of sulcal caries, relative to controls. urease activity appears to influence plaque biochemistry and metabolism in a manner that reduces cariogenicity, suggesting that recombinant, ureolytic bacteria may be useful to promote dental health.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on acquisition of mutans streptococci by infants.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a non-cariogenic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) with impaired adhesion properties, i.e., they shed easily to saliva from plaque. one hundred sixty-nine  mother-child pairs participated in a two-year study exploring whether the mothers' xylitol consumption could be used to prevent mother-child transmission of mutans streptococci. all mothers showed high salivary levels of mutans streptococci during pregnancy. the mothers in the xylitol group (n = 106) were requested to chew xylitol-sweetened gum (65% w/w) at least 2 or 3 times a day, starting three months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received either chlorhexidine (n = 30) or fluoride (n = 33) varnish treatments at 6, 12, and 18 months after delivery. the children did not chew gum or receive varnish treatments. ms were assessed from the mothers' saliva at half-year intervals and from the children's plaque at the one- and two-year examinations. the ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. the salivary ms levels of the mothers remained high and not significantly different among the three study groups throughout the study. at two years of age, 9.7% of the children in the xylitol, 28.6% in the chlorhexidine, and 48.5% in the fluoride varnish group showed a detectable level of ms. in conclusion, therefore, habitual xylitol consumption by mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction of the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at two years of age. the effect was superior to that obtained with either chlorhexidine or fluoride varnish treatments performed as single applications at six-month intervals.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

AB  == multiple interactions occur among major determinants of dental caries. we have studied the bacterial flora and ph-lowering capacity of the same dental plaques in relation to caries. the findings on the plaque flora are reported here. the buccal surfaces of upper teeth in each subject were selected for study. a low-caries group had no "white spot" caries (ws) in the selected dentition area;  a higher-caries group averaged 4.1 ws in this area. the latter group was divided  into subjects with 2, 3, or 4 ws and subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws. enumerated organisms in plaque samples (sound and ws sites) from all subjects were: (1) mutans streptococci (ms) on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin and mitis-salivarius agar; (2) non-mutans streptococci (non-ms) on mitis-salivarius agar; (3) organisms that were categorized according to their minimum ph in sugar broth, i.e., the predominant undifferentiated total flora on blood agar or the predominant non-ms flora on mitis-salivarius agar; and (4) iodophilic polysaccharide-storing organisms on trypticase-yeast extract-salts agar. plaques  covering ws lesions contained generally only low proportions (< 0.1%) of ms. the  plaque proportions of all the above 4 bacterial groups were increased in the higher-caries group but were similar for s and ws sites in this group. over half  of the total plaque flora in subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws consisted of "low-ph"-type organisms (minimum ph < 4.4). many of these were neither ms nor "low-ph" non-ms. the numerical emergence of ms in plaque appeared to be preceded  often by other types of "low-ph" bacteria, including the non-ms. caries development in the absence or presence of ms as well as different bacterial successions in plaque can be explained readily by the dynamic and positive relationship among the factors carbohydrate consumption, plaque flora composition, plaque acidogenic potential, and caries activity.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cavity disinfectants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of four commercially available cavity disinfectants and one prescription mouthwash as they came into contact with bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity. streptococcus mutans, salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus were used in the study. zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. the results of this study indicate that all of the antimicrobial agents demonstrated activity against the bacteria tested. consepsis solution produced the largest zones of inhibition against all three of the bacteria used.

TI  == composition of the oral streptococcal flora in healthy children.
AB  == objectives: to identify the predominant streptococcal species in the mouths of healthy children and to investigate the composition of the oral streptococcal flora over a period of 4 months. patients and methods: the subjects were 33 fit,  healthy schoolchildren aged between 5 and 16 years. these children were part of a large study and were the matched controls for a group of subjects undergoing bone marrow transplantation. the oral flora was sampled using an oral rinse technique  on two separate occasions 4 months apart. the outcome measures were the number of each streptococcal species per millilitre of oral rinse; the isolation frequency  of each species; the proportion of each species as a percentage of both the total streptococcal count and the total anaerobic count. results: the predominant species were streptococcus salivarius, s. oralis and s. mitis. there was no significant variation in the composition of the oral streptococcal flora over the 4 month period. conclusions: the oral rinse technique provides a reliable method  of sampling the streptococcal flora of children.

TI  == a new alkaline ph-adjusted medium enhances detection of beta-hemolytic streptococci by minimizing bacterial interference due to streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == a new selective medium (cna-p) that reduces or eliminates the inhibitory activity of bacteriocin-producing streptococcus salivarius against beta-hemolytic streptococci has been developed and compared with sheep blood agar (sba) for the  sensitive detection of small numbers of beta-hemolytic streptococci in clinical specimens. cna-p has as its basis a commercial medium (difco columbia cna agar) supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) sheep blood, and the cna is further modified by addition of 100 mm pipes buffer [piperazine-n,n'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)] (ph  7.5) to maintain cultures at an alkaline ph during incubation. cna-p was shown to inhibit the production and/or release of four different types of s. salivarius bacteriocins or bacteriocin-like inhibitory molecules. the efficacies of cna-p and sba for detection of beta-hemolytic streptococci in 1,352 pharyngeal samples  from 376 children were compared. the beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates recovered from the samples included 314 group a (s. pyogenes), 61 group g, 33 group b, and 5 group c streptococci. of 314 samples that yielded s. pyogenes, 300 were positive on cna-p (96%) and 264 (86%) were positive on sba. a significantly  greater number of s. pyogenes isolates from these samples were recovered only on  cna-p (50 of 314) compared with the number of isolates recovered only on sba (14  of 314). in addition, the degree of positivity, a measure of the total numbers of s. pyogenes isolates on the plate, was significantly higher on cna-p than on sba  (2.40 versus 2.07; p < 0.001). interestingly, cna-p was also found to enhance the hemolytic activity of streptolysin o, allowing detection of streptolysin s-deficient s. pyogenes strains which might otherwise go undetected on sba and other isolation media.

TI  == variables affecting salivary streptococcus mutans counts in a cohort of 12-year-old subjects.
AB  == background: several factors such as toothbrushing, diet, acidogenic potential of  the mutans streptococci strain and site of the carious lesion can modify the salivary streptococcus mutans (sm) counts. in the present investigation the effect of some behavioural, clinical and microbiological variables on sm salivary counts was evaluated in a cohort of 12-year-olds. methods: forty subjects were examined by two calibrated examiners (gc, al). the number of surfaces either decayed occlusal, decayed smooth or filled and the number of bleeding sextants, (clinical index for oral hygiene) were reported. saliva was collected using a tongue depressor and was plated onto mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin and 20% sucrose. the presumptive sm colonies were counted and the concentrations were logarithmically transformed. one sm strain per subject was identified and the cariogenic potential evaluated as the minimum ph value recorded, during 5 hrs of  incubation in 5% sucrose solution. the children's parents or guardians completed  a questionnaire concerning the frequency of toothbrushing, the consumption of sweet foods and soft drinks and at what age the children started brushing their teeth. the effect of the explanatory variables on sm count logarithms was evaluated by stepwise multiple regression. results: the regressors with significant additional explanatory power were cariogenic potential (b = -1.335, p = 0.00001, r2 increment = 0.312), decayed smooth surfaces (b = -0.456, p = 0.009, r2 increment = 0.114) and bleeding sextants (b = -0.113, p = 0.004, r2 increment  = 0.062), whereas the power of filled surfaces was marginally significant (p = 0.08). conclusions: on the basis of these results, it is suggested that acidogenicity is not only a cariogenic factor, but also a factor promoting colonization of oral sites by sm, especially in subjects with a high frequency of sugar consumption.

TI  == phenotypic consequences resulting from a methionine-to-valine substitution at position 48 in the hpr protein of streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in gram-positive bacteria, the hpr protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) can be phosphorylated on a histidine residue at position 15 (his(15)) by enzyme i (ei) of the pts and on a serine residue at position 46 (ser(46)) by an atp-dependent protein kinase (his approximately p and ser-p, respectively). we have isolated from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975,  by independent selection from separate cultures, two spontaneous mutants (ga3.78  and ga3.14) that possess a missense mutation in ptsh (the gene encoding hpr) replacing the methionine at position 48 by a valine. the mutation did not prevent the phosphorylation of hpr at his(15) by ei nor the phosphorylation at ser(46) by the atp-dependent hpr kinase. the levels of hpr(ser-p) in glucose-grown cells of  the parental and mutant ga3.78 were virtually the same. however, mutant cells growing on glucose produced two- to threefold less hpr(ser-p)(his approximately p) than the wild-type strain, while the levels of free hpr and hpr(his approximately p) were increased 18- and 3-fold, respectively. the mutants grew as well as the wild-type strain on pts sugars (glucose, fructose, and mannose) and on the non-pts sugars lactose and melibiose. however, the growth rate of both mutants on galactose, also a non-pts sugar, decreased rapidly with time. the m48v substitution had only a minor effect on the repression of alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, and galactokinase by glucose, but this mutation abolished diauxie by rendering cells unable to prevent the catabolism of a non-pts sugar (lactose, galactose, and melibiose) when glucose was available. the results suggested that the capacity of the wild-type cells to preferentially metabolize glucose over non-pts sugars resulted mainly from inhibition of the catabolism of  these secondary energy sources via a hpr-dependent mechanism. this mechanism was  activated following glucose but not lactose metabolism, and it did not involve hpr(ser-p) as the only regulatory molecule.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == membrane locus and ph sensitivity of paraben inhibition of alkali production by oral streptococci.
AB  == parabens were found to be potent inhibitors of alkali production from arginine by oral streptococci such as streptococcus rattus, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii. for example, 2 mumol butylparaben per ml completely and irreversibly inhibited arginolysis by intact cells of s. rattus fa-1 and was lethal for the organism. in contrast, butylparaben was not a very effective inhibitor of ureolysis by intact cells of streptococcus salivarius 57.i, although it did kill the cells. butylparaben irreversibly inhibited the cytoplasmic enzymes arginine deiminase, carbamate kinase and urease in permeabilized cells or isolated form. however, inhibition of arginolysis by intact cells appeared to be  due primarily to irreversible inhibition of transport systems for arginine uptake, because butylparaben added to intact cells did not reduce levels of arginine deiminase when the cells were subsequently permeabilized after washing.  the insensitivity of ureolysis by intact cells to butylparaben can be related to  the known high permeability of cell membranes to urea and the cytoplasmic location of urease. the potency of butylparaben as an inhibitior of arginolysis or glycolysis and as a lethal agent was found to be greater at acid ph that at neutral or alkaline ph.

TI  == mutation of aspartic acid residues in the fructosyltransferase of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975.
AB  == the site-directed mutated fructosyltransferases (ftfs) of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, d312e, d312s, d312n and d312k were all active at 37 degrees c, indicating that asp-312 present in the 'sucrose box' was not the nucleophilic asp residue responsible for the formation of a covalent fructosyl-enzyme intermediate required for enzyme activity. analysis of the kinetic constants of the purified mutated forms of the enzyme showed that asp-312 was most likely an essential amino acid involved in determining acceptor recognition and/or stabilizing a beta-turn in the protein. in contrast, when the  asp-397 of the ftf present in the conserved triplet rdp motif of all 60 bacterial and plant family-32 glycosylhydrolases was mutated to a ser residue, both sucrose hydrolysis and polymerization ceased. tryptophan emission spectra confirmed that  this mutation did not alter protein structure. comparison of published data from  other site-directed mutated enzymes implicated the asp residue in the rdp motif as the one that may form a transient covalent fructosyl intermediate during the catalysis of sucrose by the ftf of s. salivarius.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to compare traditional and newly developed root-end filling materials for resistance to bacterial microleakage. methodology: sixty extracted single-rooted teeth were randomly divided into five groups for root-end filling with mineral trioxide aggregate, super-eba, tph composite resin  with probond dentine bonding agent, dispersalloy amalgam with and without probond, and positive and negative control groups. root canals were instrumented  using the step-back technique and simulated root-end resections performed. root-end filling materials were placed in 3 mm ultrasonic retropreparations. nail varnish was applied to all external root surfaces to the level of the resected root ends to prevent lateral microleakage. samples were sterilized in an ethylene oxide sterilizer for 12 h. using a newly designed model system, the apical 3-4 mm of the roots were immersed in bhi culture medium with phenol red indicator within culture chambers. the coronal access of each specimen was inoculated every 48 h with a suspension of streptococcus salivarius. culture media were observed every  24 h for colour change indicating bacterial contamination. media demonstrating colour change were plated for s. salivarius. samples were observed for 12 weeks.  results: at 4 weeks 10% of specimens from each experimental group had evidence of leakage. at 8 weeks 20% of specimens filled with amalgam without dentine bonding  agent, super-eba and mta had evidence of leakage. at 12 weeks minor differences between materials were noted. conclusions: under the conditions of the study, despite some variations, there were no statistically significant differences in rate of microleakage among the five groups tested at either 4, 8 or 12 weeks.

TI  == an effective strategy, applicable to streptococcus salivarius and related bacteria, to enhance or confer electroporation competence.
AB  == despite the large number of techniques available for transformation of bacteria,  certain species and strains are still resistant to introduction of foreign dna. some oral streptococci are among the organisms that can be particularly difficult to transform. we performed a series of experiments that involved manipulation of  growth and recovery media and cell wall weakening, in which the electroporation conditions, cell concentration, and type and concentration of the transforming plasmid were varied. the variables were optimized such that a previously untransformable streptococcus salivarius strain, atcc 25975, could be transformed reproducibly at a level of 10(5) transformants per microg of dna. the technique was used to introduce a plasmid into other strains of s. salivarius, including a  fresh isolate. moreover, the same technique was applied successfully to a wide range of oral streptococci and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == impact on the composition of the faecal flora by a new probiotic preparation: preliminary data on maintenance treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis.
AB  == background: although 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-asa) oral compounds are the standard maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis in remission, some patients cannot use them because of side-effects. clinical and experimental observations have suggested the potential role of probiotics in inflammatory bowel disease therapy. aim: to evaluate the effects on intestinal microflora and the clinical efficacy of a new probiotic preparation in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. patients and methods: twenty patients with ulcerative colitis, intolerant or allergic to 5-asa, have been treated with a new probiotic preparation (vsl#3, csl, milan, italy) containing 5x10(11) cells/g of 3 strains of bifidobacteria, 4 strains of lactobacilli and 1 strain of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. two doses of 3 g were administered o.d. for 12 months. faecal samples for stool culture were obtained from the patients at the beginning of the trial and after 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, 90 days, 12 months and at 15 days after the end of the treatment. the following bacterial groups have been evaluated in the faeces: total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, enterococci, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms. patients were assessed clinically every two months, and assessed endoscopically at 6 and 12 months or in relapse. results: faecal concentrations of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria increased significantly in all patients, compared to their basal level, from the 20th day of treatment (p<0.05) and remained stable throughout the study. concentrations of bacteroides, clostridia, coliforms, total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria did not change significantly during treatment (p = n.s.). fifteen of 20 treated patients remained in remission during the study, one patient was lost to follow up, while the remaining relapsed. no significant side-effects have been reported. conclusions: these results show that this probiotic preparation is able to colonize the intestine, and suggest that it may  be useful in maintaining the remission in ulcerative colitis patients intolerant  or allergic to 5-asa. controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary results.

AB  == earlier work in vitro showed that oleanolic acid (oa) was a potential inhibitor of insoluble glucan (isg) synthesis from mutans streptococci (ms). in this study, two oleanolic acid-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds (oa-cds), oleanolic acid-g1-beta-cyclodextrin (oa-g1-beta cd) and oleanolic acid-beta-cyclodextrin (oa-beta cd), were assayed for their effects on isg synthesis from streptococcus  mutans mt8148r, and on the growth of oral bacteria. oa-beta cd inhibited isg synthesis by 55.3 and 37.4% at 62.5 and 15.6 micrograms/ml of oa, respectively. both oa-cds inhibited the growth of ms, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius at 4 to 8 micrograms/ml of oa. the anticariogenic effect of the oa-beta cd was examined in  a rat-caries model. rats in the infected control groups showed the highest caries score. the infected treatment group b (0.5% oa in diet) showed lower scores than  the control group. these results suggest that oa-beta cd is a potential anti-caries agent.

AB  == the recombinant fructosyltransferase (ftf) of streptococcus salivarius was expressed in escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity after a combination of adsorption, ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. the n-terminal signal sequence of the ftf was removed by e. coli at the same site as  in its natural host. the purified ftf exhibited maximum activity at ph 6.0 and 37 degrees c, was activated by ca2+, but inhibited by the metal ions cu2+, zn2+, hg2+ and fe3+. the enzyme catalysed the transfer of the fructosyl moiety of sucrose to a number of acceptors, including water, glucose and sucrose via a ping pong mechanism involving a fructosyl-enzyme intermediate. while this mechanism of catalysis is utilized by the levansucrases of bacillus subtilis and acetobacter diazotrophicus and the values of the kinetic constants for the three enzymes are  similar, sucrose was a far more efficient fructosyl-acceptor for the ftf of s. salivarius than for the two other enzymes.

AB  == purpose: to establish a method to measure microbial kill caused by ultrasonic cleaning. secondarily, to estimate the escape of bacteria from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions during operation of the unit. materials and methods: three commercial enzymatic detergents and saline were used as cleaners. depending on detergent, initial operational temperature was 21 degrees c, 37 degrees c or 60 degrees c. streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 (s. mutans suspensions) was adjusted to a final concentration of 1.0 x 10(3) cells/ml in saline. suspensions (2000 ml) at the desired temperatures were added to the cleaner. aliquots were removed, serially diluted in letheen broth and spread plated over mitis salivarius agar. appropriate amounts of detergent solutions were added to s. mutans suspensions and the cleaner operated for 20 minutes. aliquots were then removed and plated. the process was repeated twice. plates were aerobically incubated at 37 degrees c for 7 days and the colonies counted. the procedure was repeated using three temperatures of s. mutans suspensions (21 degrees c, 37 degrees c or 60 degrees c), but without detergent or ultrasound. also, detergents were added to 21 degrees c s. mutans suspensions and allowed to sit for 20 minutes without ultrasonic cleaning. microbial sampling was done as previously described. results: results when ultrasound was used indicated that little kill (5-15%) occurred in 21 degrees c or 37 degrees c detergent solutions. greater kill (25-35%) was noted with 21 degrees c and 37 degrees c saline. complete kill was accomplished with 60 degrees c saline or the 60 degrees c detergent solution. when ultrasound and detergent were not used, there was no kill in 21 degrees c and 37 degrees c saline, but complete kill in 60 degrees c saline. in the absence of ultrasound no kill was noted in 21 degrees c s. mutans suspensions to which detergent had been added. total kill of s. mutans was observed in 60 degrees c saline or 60 degrees c detergent with ultrasound or after a 20-minute exposure in 60 degrees c saline without ultrasonic cleaning. very few bacteria escaped from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions into the air during the cleaning process. placement of the unit lid effectively reduced emissions to zero.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

AB  == aim: this study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. methodology: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, str. pyogenes, escherichia coli and candida albicans were included in the study. pre-sterilized whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar petri plates.  each plate was incubated aerobically. a zone of inhibition was recorded for each  plate and the results were analysed statistically. results: 5.25% naocl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition.  saline was always ineffective. decreased concentration of naocl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. cresophene showed a significantly larger (p < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. conclusions: 5.25% naocl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. a reduced concentration of naocl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. when compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == molecular relationships and antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans group streptococci isolated from blood of neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  == from january 1995 to may 1998, 57 episodes of bacteremia due to viridans group streptococci were identified in 50 febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic  malignancies. four patients experienced two separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia, and one patient had four separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia. strains were identified to species level as streptococcus mitis (n =  37), streptococcus oralis (n = 19), and streptococcus salivarius (n = 1). epidemiologic relatedness of these strains was studied by using pcr-based fingerprinting with m13 and eric-2 primers and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with restriction enzyme smai. all strains that were isolated from different patients exhibited unique fingerprint patterns, thus suggesting that viridans group streptococcal bacteremia usually derives from an endogenous source. cross-transmission of strains between patients could not be established. four s.  mitis isolates recovered during four separate bacteremic episodes in a single patient had identical fingerprint patterns. susceptibility testing was carried out by broth microdilution technique according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. the mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited were (in milligrams per liter) as follows: 0. 5 (penicillin), 0.5 (amoxicillin), 0.25 (cefotaxime), 2 (chloramphenicol), 4 (erythromycin), 0.5 (clindamycin), >/=32 (tetracycline), >/=32 (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 4 (ciprofloxacin), 0.5 (sparfloxacin), 0.5 (vancomycin), 0.25 (teicoplanin), and 1  (quinupristin-dalfopristin). high-level penicillin resistance (mic, >/=4 mg/liter) was found in one isolate only, but intermediate penicillin resistance was noted in 11 isolates (19%). resistance rates to other drugs were as follows:  7% (amoxicillin), 4% (cefotaxime), 4% (chloramphenicol), 32% (erythromycin), 9% (clindamycin), 39% (tetracycline), 68% (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 23% (ciprofloxacin), 0% (sparfloxacin), 0% (vancomycin), 0% (teicoplanin), and 0% (quinupristin-dalfopristin).

TI  == [analysis of serum antibodies to alpha-streptococci in patients with tonsil-related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  == to determine the systemic immune response to alpha-streptococci (str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis) and beta streptococcus (str. pyogenes t12) in patients with tonsil related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), we measured  serum antibody levels to whole cell body antigens of streptococcus (str.) sanguis, str. salivarius, str. mitis or str. pyogenes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the serum igg antibody levels to alpha-streptococci, str. sanguis and str. salivarius were significantly higher in patients with ppp (n = 44) than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt: n = 25) and in healthy  adults (n = 17). serum antibody igg level to str. pyogenes was not different among the 3 groups. the iga antibody levels against any streptococcus strain were not different among the 3 groups. the igm antibody levels to str. pyogenes were significantly higher in patients with rt than in patients with ppp. in western blot analysis, the serum igg antibodies against 25-27 kda protein from whole cell body of str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis were found more frequently in patients with ppp than in healthy adults. however, the western blot profile in str. pyogenes was not different between ppp and healthy adults. no significant difference was seen in the western blot profile of igm or igm antibodies to any streptococcal whole cell bodies. these data suggest that systemic hyper immune response to alpha-streptococci may be present in patients with tonsil-related ppp and the 25-27 kda protein of the organism may be the target for this immunologic  abnormality.

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI  == note: evaluation of selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacterium sp. in milk.
AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == effect of steam sterilization inside the turbine chambers of dental turbines.
AB  == objective: it has been demonstrated that contamination of the insides of high-speed dental turbines occurs and that bacteria as well as viruses may remain infectious when expelled from such turbines during subsequent use. consequently,  it has been widely recommended that a high-speed turbine be sterilized after each patient. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of steam autoclaving on a high-speed dental turbine with a contaminated turbine chamber. study design: streptococcus salivarius and endospores of bacillus stearothermophilus were used as test organisms to determine the effectiveness of  4 different small non-vacuum autoclaves and one vacuum autoclave. results: the study demonstrated different efficiencies among the small non-vacuum autoclaves,  the best showing close to a 6 log reduction of the test organisms inside the turbine chamber. when cleaning and lubrication of the high-speed dental turbine was carried out before autoclaving, this level of reduction was observed for all  the examined non-vacuum autoclaves. conclusions: it is concluded that cleaning before sterilization is essential for safe use of high-speed dental turbines and  that small non-vacuum autoclaves should be carefully evaluated before being used  for the reprocessing of hollow instruments such as high-speed turbines.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == the hpr(ser) kinase of streptococcus salivarius: purification, properties, and cloning of the hprk gene.
AB  == in gram-positive bacteria, hpr, a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, is phosphorylated on a serine residue at position 46 by an atp-dependent protein kinase. the hpr(ser) kinase of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 was purified, and the encoding gene (hprk) was cloned by using a nucleotide probe designed from the n-terminal amino acid sequence. the predicted amino acid sequence of the s. salivarius enzyme showed 45% identity with the bacillus subtilis enzyme, the conserved residues being located mainly in the c-terminal half of the protein. the predicted hprk gene product has a molecular mass of 34,440 da and a pi of 5.6. these values agree well with those found experimentally by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, molecular sieve chromatography in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, and chromatofocusing using the purified protein. the native protein migrates on a superdex 200 hr column as a 330,000-da protein, suggesting that the hpr(ser) kinase is a decamer. the enzyme requires mg2+ for activity and functions optimally at ph 7.5. unlike the enzyme from other gram-positive bacteria, the hpr(ser) kinase from s. salivarius is not stimulated  by fdp or other glycolytic intermediates. the enzyme is inhibited by inorganic phosphate, and its kms for hpr and atp are 31 microm and 1 mm, respectively.

TI  == bacteria used for the production of yogurt inactivate carcinogens and prevent dna damage in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid-producing bacteria prevent carcinogen-induced preneoplastic lesions and tumors in rat colon. because the mechanisms responsible for these protective  effects are unknown, two strains of lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 191r and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus ch3, that are used to produce yogurt, were investigated in vitro and in vivo to elucidate their potential to deactivate carcinogens. using the "comet assay" to detect genetic damage, we found that l. bulgaricus 191r applied orally to rats could prevent 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced dna breaks in the colon in vivo, whereas st. thermophilus ch3 were not effective. however, in vitro, both strains  prevented dna damage induced by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in isolated primary rat colon cells. extracts prepared from milk fermented with st.  thermophilus ch3 were as efficient in deactivating mnng as was l-cysteine. isolated metabolites arising from bacteria during fermentation in the colon or in milk [l(+) lactate, d(-) lactate, palmitic acid and isopalmitic acid] were not effective. we postulate that thiol-containing breakdown products of proteins, via catalysis by bacterial proteases, could be one mechanism by which mnng or other carcinogens are deactivated in the gut lumen resulting in reduced damage to colonic mucosal cells.

AB  == in the course of the work done the specific and quantitative composition of the streptococcal autoflora of the fauces of the cosmonauts and the members of backup drew was investigated. in populations of isolated microorganisms the non-pathogenic streptococci have dominated among which s. salivarius prevailed. the same species has constantly been isolated in all the cosmonauts, pre- and postflight. observation of the microflora state of the fauces at different stages of their professional activity made it possible to reveal the peculiarities of an individual dynamics in the number of nonpathogenic streptococci isolated from tampon depending on the participation of the test-subjects in the previous space  missions. this is evidently a reflection of the effect of psychoemotional tension on the state of colonization resistance (cr) of the fauces mucosa and, as result  of this, on its microflora. in turn, the occurrence of the individual species of  conditionally-pathogenic streptococci after the mission points to a decrease in the cr under effect of unfavourable factors of space mission.

TI  == [alpha-hemolytic streptococci and root canal irrigants. an evaluation of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide].
AB  == background and aims: the main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. they are regarded as facultative  anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other  it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. the aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation  irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. methods: the test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (dasit, cornaredo, italy): streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mc farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. the following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (cetrexidin vebas, s. giuliano milanese, italy); 2) naocl 1% (ogna, milan, italy). each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species  used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. results: the results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == transcriptional regulation of the streptococcus salivarius 57.i urease operon.
AB  == the streptococcus salivarius 57.i ure cluster was organized as an operon, beginning with urei, followed by ureabc (structural genes) and ureefgd (accessory genes). northern analyses revealed transcripts encompassing structural genes and  transcripts containing the entire operon. a sigma70-like promoter could be mapped 5' to urei (purei) by primer extension analysis. the intensity of the signal increased when cells were grown at an acidic ph and was further enhanced by excess carbohydrate. to determine the function(s) of two inverted repeats located 5' to purei, transcriptional fusions of the full-length promoter region (purei),  or a deletion derivative (pureidelta100), and a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene were constructed and integrated into the chromosome  to generate strains pureicat and pureidelta100cat, respectively. cat specific activities of pureicat were repressed at ph 7.0 and induced at ph 5.5 and by excess carbohydrate. in pureidelta100cat, cat activity was 60-fold higher than in pureicat at ph 7.0 and ph induction was nearly eliminated, indicating that expression was negatively regulated. thus, it was concluded that purei was the predominant, regulated promoter and that regulation was governed by a mechanism differing markedly from other known mechanisms for bacterial urease expression.

TI  == 'soft-particle' analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of a fibrillated and non-fibrillated oral streptococcal strain: streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the electrophoretic mobility of microbial cell surfaces can be analysed in terms  of a so-called soft layer model, in which the electrophoretic mobility is described as originating from the potentials over the surface charge layer and the membrane fixed charges. often, the polyelectrolyte layer deforms under the influence of ionic strength variations. in the soft layer analysis of electrophoretic mobilities this is expressed in the softness 1/lambda. here, we determined the softness of two oral streptococcal strains, s. salivarius hb and hbc12 from particulate microelectrophoresis in kcl solutions of varying ionic strength. electron microscopy of negatively-stained organisms and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that strain hb had several classes of proteinaceous fibrils with lengths up to 178 nm on its outermost surface, while variant hbc12 had a bald, peptidoglycan-rich outer surface. the fibrillated strain hb appeared as relatively soft (1/lambda equals 1.4 nm) from analysis of its electrophoretic mobility, while the bald variant hbc12 was hard (1/lambda equals 0.7 nm) due to its comparatively rigid, peptidoglycan-rich outer surface,  characteristic to gram-positive bacteria. the presence of proteinaceous fibrils on strain hb slightly shielded the membrane fixed charges on hbc12.

AB  == the effect of a new type of antibacterial temporary filling material was evaluated. ag-zn-zeolite (bactekiller, kanebo, japan) and sio2 filler were incorporated into urethane acrylate monomer paste in amounts of 5/55, 10/50, 20/40 and 30/30 wt%, respectively. the present study was designed to use a dye penetration test to measure direct inhibition of bacterial growth of four oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis). the amounts of silver and zinc ions released from these materials were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the results indicated that the occurrence of marginal leakage was low in all of these materials. these materials exhibited prominent in-vitro antibacterial activity against s. mutans and s. mitis. the ag-zn-zeolite in these materials was able to  release very small but detectable amounts of ag and zn even 4 weeks after the immersion started. the larger the amounts of ag-zn-zeolite that were incorporated, the greater the release of silver and zinc. however, it appears that increasing antibacterial activity is not promoted by the higher ratio of ag-zn-zeolite.

TI  == random amplified polymorphic dna and amplified ribosomal dna spacer polymorphism: powerful methods to differentiate streptococcus thermophilus strains.
AB  == streptococci from different collections and dairy materials were characterized by conventional and molecular methods. after amplification of the 16s-23s rdna spacer region, all the strains referable to the genus streptococcus exhibited a single polymerase chain reaction (pcr) product, allowing their differentiation from enterococci. cleaving this pcr product with hae iii, two different restriction patterns could be observed, allowing streptococcus salivarius dsm 20560t, strep. thermophilus ncdo 822 and two strains of streptococcus spp. to be  gathered in one group and all the other strains in another. in order to achieve strain typing, all the cultures were investigated by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis employing two selected primers. the results were treated  by cluster analysis, appearing significantly consistent with both the taxonomic position and the origin of the strains. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of sma i digests of the genomic dna from 11 representative strains with decreasing levels of rapd similarity allowed their diversity to be confirmed, even though rapd-pcr proved to be less discriminating than pfge analysis. the results are discussed with reference to the capability of the analytical procedures used to aid both identification and strain typing of streptococci, as  well as the taxonomic structure of the species strep. thermophilus.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius urease expression: involvement of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system.
AB  == urease expression in streptococcus salivarius 57.1 is induced by acidic ph, and further enhanced at high growth rate and with excess carbohydrate. notably, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) activity is repressed in oral streptococci under the same conditions. to test the hypothesis  that the pts may be involved in urease regulation, spontaneous mutants (pts-1 and pts-4) that were resistant to 2-deoxyglucose were isolated. when compared to wild-type, pts-1 was devoid of enzyme iiamanh (eiiamanii) and synthesized low amounts of eiiamanl, and pts-4 was devoid of eiiamanl, but produced wild-type levels of eiiamanh. urease expression was examined in continuous chemostat cultures at steady state. induction by acidic ph was still observed in both mutants, but at lower levels compared to wild-type, under carbohydrate limiting conditions. conversely, the lower level of expression in pts-4 could be overcome  in excess carbohydrate. the data indicated evidence of a molecular link between the pts, sugar metabolism, and regulation of urease expression.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans group streptococci in taiwan with an emphasis on the high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined for 207  isolates of viridans group streptococci recovered from patients with significant  infections in taiwan during 1995 and 1997. variable degrees of susceptibility existed among nine species. high-level penicillin resistance (mic > or = 4.0 mg/l) was found most frequently in streptococcus oralis (35%), followed by streptococcus mitis (20%) and streptococcus salivarius (8%). however, s. salivarius showed the lowest rate of susceptibility to penicillin (50%). macrolide resistance also occurred most frequently in s. oralis isolates (55%) but in none of streptococcus mutans. penicillin and macrolides tended to be less  active against isolates recovered from non-invasive sites than against those isolated from invasive sites. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam against penicillin-resistant isolates. ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin showed good  in-vitro activity against all isolates, with mic90s of 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. none of these isolates displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin and most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. these results indicate the species-related variability of susceptibility, especially to penicillin, macrolides and tetracycline. in addition to s. mitis, s. oralis also  displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides. the difference in susceptibilities between species of viridans streptococci indicates the importance of accurate identification and the need for continuing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

AB  == purpose: to determine if microabraded surfaces inhibit streptococcus mutans colonization. materials and methods: ten extracted molars were obtained and sectioned in half mesio-distally. the mesial side was treated with microabrasion  (prema compound). the distal surface was designated as the control site. a plastic tube was secured on each surface with resin composite, exposing a surface of 13.2 mm 2. s. mutans 10,499 was cultured in tsb-ye supplemented with 5% sucrose and 2.5% glucose was added to each secured site in addition to 50 microliters of cell suspension. samples were incubated in a 5% co2 chamber for 7  days at 37 degrees c. samples were taken from each site, incubated with dextranase (75 micrograms 1 ml), sonicated, and vortexed to disrupt cellular aggregates as much as possible. samples were then plated on mitis-salivarius agar using a spiral plating system. enumeration of numbers of colonizing bacteria was  achieved following standard spiral plating system methodology. results: the mean  for the microabraded group was 1.12 x 10(2) cfu/tooth and for the control it was  1.15 x 10(4). analyzing the data revealed a significant difference (p = 0.0188).

TI  == the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system of streptococcus salivarius. functional and biochemical characterization of iiabl(man) and iiabh(man).
AB  == previous studies have suggested that the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system of streptococcus salivarius consists of a nonphosphorylated enzyme ii domain that functions in tandem with a separate enzymatic complex called iii(man). the iii(man) complex is believed to be composed of two protein dimers with molecular masses of approximately 72 kda. analysis of these proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence  of sodium dodecyl sulfate has indicated that one dimer is composed of two 38.9-kda subunits called iiih(man), and the other of two 35.2-kda subunits called iiil(man). this study was undertaken to determine (1) the number and nature of the phosphorylated residue(s) on iiih(man) and iiil(man) and the phosphorylation  sequence allowing the transfer of the phosphoryl group from hpr(his approximately p) to the mannose:pts substrates; (2) whether iiih(man) and iiil(man) originate from two different genes or result from a posttranslational modification; and (3) whether these two proteins are involved in the phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose, a substrate of the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system. we showed that both iiih(man) and iiil(man) were phosphorylated on two histidine residues. one phosphate bond was heat-labile (phosphorylation at the n1 position  of the imidazole ring), while the second was heat-resistant (phosphorylation at the n3 position of the imidazole ring). the sequence of the first phosphorylation site was deduced by comparing the n-terminal amino acid sequence of both forms of iii(man) with iia domains of the eii-mannose family. the sequences of both forms  were identical over the 15 first amino acids, that is, migiiiashgkfaeg. the sequence of the second phosphorylation site was determined for iiil(man) as ihgqvatnxtp. hence, iiih(man) and iiil(man) are pts proteins of the iiab type and should be renamed iiabh(man) and iiabl(man). iiabh(man) and iiabl(man) had different peptide profiles after digestion with proteases, indicating that these  two proteins are encoded by two different genes. in vitro pep-dependent phosphorylation assays conducted with a spontaneous mutant devoid of both forms of iiab(man) suggested that the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system of s. salivarius is composed of an uncharacterized nonphosphorylated membrane component that works in tandem with iiabl(man). the physiological functions of iiabh(man) remain unknown.

TI  == time-dependent interfacial tension of whole saliva and saliva-bacteria mixes.
AB  == using a tensiometer in accordance with the drop volume principle, the surface tension decrease with time was determined for whole and for 2%, 10%, and 50% aqueous solutions of saliva from one healthy donor. the reduction of surface tension with time was also measured for 10% and 20% saliva solutions with added samples of streptococcus salivarius krf2, s. sanguis krf3, and actinomyces naeslundii 2t-55. the results show that 1) there is a time dependence of the surface tension reduction of both whole saliva and diluted saliva, 2) an increase of the concentration of whole saliva in salivary solutions gives rise to larger and more rapid surface tension reduction, 3) the proteinaceous components of saliva appear to have a dominant contribution on surface tension in whole saliva  and diluted saliva, and 4) the surface-active proteinaceous components in saliva  have the ability to dominate the air-saliva interface also in the presence of high concentrations of salivary bacteria.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == evaluation of a new device for sterilizing dental high-speed handpieces.
AB  == dental high-speed turbines and handpieces can take up and expel microorganisms during operation and thus need regular sterilization. this study established a method for validating devices used to sterilize high-speed turbines and handpieces. the air and water channels and turbine chambers were contaminated with suspensions of streptococcus salivarius or endospores of bacillus stearothermophilus. the effect of flushing and/or autoclaving performed by a new  device combining both procedures was evaluated by counting the number of viable bacteria recovered from these devices. further, the effect on clinically used handpieces was evaluated. in an initial experiment, the device partially reduced  s. salivarius, and the endospores survived. in a second experiment, a 5 to 6 log  reduction of s. salivarius in air and water channels was obtained. no growth was  observed in clinically used high-speed handpieces, and both s. salivarius and endospores were eliminated from the turbine chambers. thus, the method of validation proved capable of discriminating between different levels of bacterial reduction.

TI  == effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin a against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  == it is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. this study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) activity against three indigenous streptococci (streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis i) and s. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. this showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. compared with before radiotherapy, the s-iga titer against s. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. these results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific s-iga production of virulent streptococci in most patients with  head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. the resulting altered balance in the s-iga system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.

AB  == attempts at site-directed mutagenesis of the fructosyltransferase (ftf) gene of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 using standard protocols were unsuccessful and resulted in a series of deletions. these deletions appeared to commence at points within the ftf gene where there were palindromic sequences which were capable of forming closed loop structures that acted as terminators under the conditions of mutagenesis. to overcome this problem, two modified mutagenic techniques were developed. they made use of t4 dna polymerase in conjunction with either t7 dna polymerase at 37 degrees c or vent dna polymerase from thermococcus litoralis at an elevated temperature. these methods eliminated the need for a single-stranded dna template and allowed polymerisation through palindromic sequences to rapidly produce multiple site-directed mutations.

AB  == the separate and combined effects of peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite (hoscn/oscn-) and f- ions on glucose uptake and growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were investigated. s. mutans cells were grown to late exponential or stationary growth phase, harvested, washed and suspended in 2.0 ml of sterilized  human whole saliva supplemented with 10 mm d-glucose. this saliva-bacteria mixture was supplemented with 5-150 microm h2o2 at ph 5.0 or 6.5. at ph 5.0, up to 103 +/- 21 microm hoscn/oscn- was generated. after 20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, the saliva-bacteria suspension exposed to hoscn/oscn- were plated on mitis salivarius agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 2 days. identical experiments were made with f- ions (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mm). both hoscn/oscn- and f- caused a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition at ph 5.0, whereas no inhibition was observed at ph 6.5. when f- and hoscn/oscn- were added simultaneously at ph 5.0, an additive effect of growth inhibition was observed. in glucose incorporation experiments the bacteria-saliva mixture was exposed to 1 microm hoscn/oscn-, 0.5 mm f- or both. f-, hoscn/oscn- or their combination in sterilized whole saliva at ph 5.0 caused 14.2, 67.8 and 74.2% inhibition, respectively. these observations indicate that f- and hoscn/oscn- ions have an additive inhibitory effect on s. mutans and therefore their combination is likely to be more antibacterial than either agent alone.

TI  == replacement of isoleucine-47 by threonine in the hpr protein of streptococcus salivarius abrogates the preferential metabolism of glucose and fructose over lactose and melibiose but does not prevent the phosphorylation of hpr on serine-46.
AB  == phosphorylation of hpr on a serine residue at position 46 (ser-46) by an atp-dependent protein kinase has been reported in several gram-positive bacteria, and the resulting intermediate, hpr(ser-p), has been shown to mediate inducer exclusion in lactococci and lactobacilli and catabolite repression in bacillus subtilis and bacillus megaterium. we report here the phenotypic properties of an  isogenic spontaneous mutant (g22.4) of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, in which a missense mutation results in the replacement of isoleucine at position 47 (ile-47) by threonine (thr) in hpr. this substitution did not prevent the phosphorylation of hpr on ser-46, nor did it impede the phosphorylation of hpr on his-15 by ei or the transfer of the phosphoryl group from hpr(his-p) to other pts proteins. however, the 147t substitution did perturb, in glucose-grown but not in galactose-grown cells, the cellular equilibrium between the various forms of hpr, resulting in an increase in the amount of free hpr at the expense of hpr(his-p)(ser-p); the levels of hpr(his-p) and hpr(ser-p) were not affected. growth on melibiose was virtually identical for the wild-type and mutant strains, whereas the generation time of the mutant on the other sugars tested (glucose, fructose, mannose, lactose and galactose) increased 1.2- to 1.5-fold. the preferential metabolism of pts sugars (glucose and fructose) over non-pts sugars  (lactose and melibiose) that is observed in wild-type cells was abolished in cells of mutant g22.4. moreover, alpha- and beta-galactosidases were derepressed  in glucose- and fructose-grown cells of the mutant. the data suggest that hpr regulates the preferential metabolism of pts sugars over the non-pts sugars, lactose and melibiose, through the repression of the pertinent catabolic genes. this hpr-dependent repression, however, seems to occur solely when cells are growing on a pts sugar.

TI  == construction and characterization of a recombinant ureolytic streptococcus mutans and its use to demonstrate the relationship of urease activity to ph modulating capacity.
AB  == to begin to understand the contribution of oral microbial ureolysis to the inhibition of dental caries, we sought to construct a recombinant, ureolytic mutans streptococcus and correlate the ureolytic capacity of plaque bacteria with ph moderating ability. streptococcus mutans gs-5 was transformed with a plasmid containing the urease genes from streptococcus salivarius 57.i. the recombinant strain, s. mutans ac04, stably maintained the urease genes. high levels of urease activity were detected, with a maximum specific activity of 0.9 mumol of urea hydrolyzed/min/mg cell dry weight when the growth medium was supplemented with 50 microm exogenous nicl2. harboring the recombinant plasmid, or growth in nicl2, did not markedly affect the glycolytic capacity of s. mutans. in vitro ph drop analysis of s. mutans ac04, metabolizing glucose and physiologically relevant concentrations of urea simultaneously, demonstrated that increasing the urease activity of plaque bacteria resulted in a corresponding reduction in the depth and the duration of the glycolytic ph fall. the results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering urease producing s. mutans and suggest that enhancing  the ureolytic capacity of dental plaque, particularly cariogenic plaque, may help to offset the progression of the caries process.

AB  == acid-adaptive responses could be induced readily in oral lactic-acid bacteria by  growing them in batch cultures with excess sugar or more conveniently and rapidly by transferring cells to acidified growth media for the time required for biomass doubling. the response of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was induced in a progressive  rather than all-or-nothing way, and the extent of acid tolerance was inversely related to the ph of the inducing medium over a range from 8.5 to 5. the weak acids fluoride, acetate, or lactate did not measurably enhance acid adaptation, and so the response did not appear to depend primarily on changes in delta ph or  the proton motive force across the cell membrane. transcription and translation to form new proteins did appear to be necessary, as indicated by inhibition of adaptation by rifampin or chloramphenicol and by lack of adaptation by cells suspended in phosphate buffer at ph 5. streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei were acid adapted by the rapid method, and the method appeared to be generally useful for oral lactic-acid bacteria. the rapid induction of the response in multiple oral lactic-acid bacteria suggests that it is of general importance for maintaining a diversity of organisms in the oral microbiota, which is regularly subjected to acid stresses.

TI  == in vivo binding of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp (identical to gcdfp-15) to oral and non-oral bacteria detection and identification of ep-gp binding species.
AB  == extra parotid glycoprotein (ep-gp) is a glycoprotein isolated from human saliva,  having homologues in several other body fluids. the biological role of ep-gp and  its homologues is unknown. recently, ep-gp was shown to bind in vitro to the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb. in contrast, no binding to a number of other oral microorganisms could be demonstrated. in the present study we have determined whether binding of ep-gp to bacteria occurs in vivo in saliva and in other ep-gp containing body fluids. therefore the presence of ep-gp on bacteria in vivo was determined by analyzing oral, skin and ear floras by confocal fluoresence microscopy using specific antibodies. about 12% of the in vivo oral flora had ep-gp present on their surface, while approximately 5% of the bacteria  from ear canal or skin was positive for ep-gp. iga was detected on approximately  65% of the salivary bacteria, whereas the high-molecular weight mucin (mg1) and cystatin c were not detectable on any oral bacterium. using a replica-plate assay, a number of ep-gp binding strains in saliva were isolated and identified as gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorium, streptococcus acidominimus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus parasanguis. bacteria from the ear canal and skin bacteria were identified as staphylococcus hominis. it is concluded that ep-gp is selectively bound in vivo to several oral  and non-oral bacterial species.

TI  == the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci and  its role in the control of sugar metabolism.
AB  == oral streptococci are sugar-fermentative bacteria comprising at least 19 distinct species and are a significant proportion of the normal microbial population of the mouth and upper respiratory tract of humans. these streptococci transport several sugars by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) which concomitantly catalyzes the phosphorylation and translocation of mono- and  disaccharides via a chain of enzymic reactions that transfer a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to the incoming sugar. a number of pts components, including hpr, enzyme i and some enzymes ii, have been studied at the biochemical and/or genetical level in streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. moreover, compelling evidence indicates that the oral streptococcal pts is involved in the regulation of sugar metabolism. results are  accumulating suggesting that a protein called iiabman, as well as the phosphocarrier protein hpr, are key regulatory components that allow these bacteria to select rapidly metabolizable sugars, such as glucose or fructose, over less readily utilizable carbohydrates. circumstantial evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms by which oral streptococcal pts exert their regulatory functions differ from mechanisms in other gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius meningitis: a case report and literature review.
AB  == twelve hours after spinal anaesthesia, a 61-year-old patient developed meningitis with fever, somnolence, headache and stiffness of the neck. the cerebrospinal fluid was found to contain 5.279/mm(3) cells (95 granulocytes), 12.800 mg/l protein and 14.0 mmol/l lactate. streptococcus salivarius was detected in the culture. the patient was treated with antibiotics (initially cefotaxime, fosfomycin and gentamycin, later piperacillin and sulbactam). restitutio ad integrum took place after 7 days. thirteen cases of streptococcus salivarius meningitis over the past 40 years are described in the literature, nine of which  occurred following spinal puncture. streptococcus salivarius was probably communicated by the medical personnel from the oral cavity when working without masks. the outcome in each case was good. in our opinion suitable masks must be worn during spinal puncture. although iatrogenic infection is uncommon, it cannot be ruled out.

TI  == mitis salivarius-bacitracin 10% sacarose agar for oral streptococci and streptococcus mutans counts.
AB  == the msb agar (mitis salivarius-bacitracin) 20% sacarose medium is frequently used for the isolation and count of total streptococci and streptococcus mutans. although it is considered a selective culture medium for this micro-organism, s.  mutans recovery in this medium is much lower than in this mitis salivarius agar (msa). because the number of s. mutans in saliva is used for estimating caries risk and activity from a microbiological stand point, the aim of this work was to find a modification of the msb 20% sacarose medium so that it would offer not only selectivity in the isolation but also maximum recovery. this would detect people at risk more efficiency and would evaluate the preventive odontological treatments more accurately. the results show that: 1) the greatest recovery of total streptococci and s. mutans is obtained in the msb 10% sacarose medium, 2) s. mutans must be incubated in aerobiosis and the total streptococci in a candle  jar (10% co2). msb 10% sacarose medium is proposed as a choice medium for the microbiological estimation of cariogenic risk and activity, to detect infection levels and evaluate preventive odontological treatments.

TI  == nucleotide sequence analysis of the streptococcus gordonii glucosyltransferase gene, gtfg.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii has an extracellular glucosyltransferase (gtf) that polymerizes the glucose moiety of sucrose to form both water-soluble and water-insoluble glucans. whereas multiple gtf genes have been identified in strains of mutans streptococci and streptococcus salivarius, a single gene, designated gtfg, encodes the gtf of s. gordonii challis. gtfg is also unique among the characterized gtfs in that it has a described regulatory determinant, rgg. furthermore, the gtf activity in s. gordonii undergoes reversible phase variation between high and low levels. in order to gain insight into this novel gtf system, the nucleotide sequence of gtfg was determined and found to consist of a 4,734 base pair open reading frame encoding a protein with a deduced molecular weight of ca. 174,000. gtfg was similar to other sequenced gtfs with a  conserved signal sequence followed by a ca. 600-bp region distinctive for gtfg, a conserved region encoding a putative catalytic active site and a series of six direct repeats in the carboxyl terminal region implicated in glucan binding. although comparison of gtfg to other gtfs did not show a basis for the primer-independence of the encoded enzyme or the nature of the glucan products, the gtfg sequence data provide an important basis for further studies of these enzymes.

(ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to determine the extent to which bacteria not detected by culture contribute to the microbial flora of the bowel of preterm infants with and without neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (nec). fecal samples  from 32 preterm infants in special care baby units including samples from 10 infants with nec were examined by culture and pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene (rdna). the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified with eubacterial primers, and the amplification products derived from the fecal sample dna were compared with the products from individual cultured isolates by pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), allowing the dna from uncultured bacteria to be identified. for the 22 infants without nec weekly samples were examined for a mean of 5.3 postnatal weeks. the total number of types detected by culture combined with pcr-dgge was 10.1 per infant, of which pcr-dgge contributed 10.4% of the types identified. additional types detected by pcr-dgge were found in 14 (63.6%) of the 22 infants. the majority of the sequences associated with uncultured bacteria showed > 90% 16s rdna sequence identity with sequences from culturable human enteric flora, and all were found in single infants with the exception of sequences indistinguishable by dgge from seven infants. these sequences showed > 90% sequence identity with the 16s rdna of streptococcus salivarius and may have been derived from upper gastrointestinal or respiratory tract flora. in the present study uncultured bacteria detected by pcr-dgge were no more frequent in fecal samples from infants with nec than in samples from infants without nec, although these findings do not exclude the possibility of unrecognized bacteria associated with the mucosa of the small intestine of infants with nec.

TI  == selection of an adhesive phenotype of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus for use in fixed-bed reactors.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus was cultivated in a chemostat in order to obtain an adhesive phenotype of this strain. when the system was operated at low dilution rates (d < 0.2 h-1) for about 4 weeks, the strain formed a visible film on the surface of the culture vessel. the biofilm cells were not washed out even when dilution rates were increased (d = 6.9 h-1), and this resulted in a high biomass productivity (p = 4.1 g1(-1) h-1). on the other hand,  when the culture was grown at dilution rates faster than 0.2 h-1, only the free suspended cells were present in the culture broth, and were washed out at velocities of about 1.0 h-1. the biomass productivity was consequently lower (p = 1.33 g1(-1) h-1) than in the previous case. the selected adhesive phenotype was grown on different glass beads and the possibility of lactate fermentation in a continuous and semicontinuous mode was demonstrated.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the growth of salivary and selected oral microorganisms of areca nut, aqueous extracts of the nut, its major alkaloid arecoline and the components tannic acid and catechin of its tannin fraction. the antibacterial properties of the above were tested on streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus salivarius, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum and, as a control, staphylococcus aureus. this was followed by investigating its  effect on salivary organisms cultured from the saliva after chewing boiled areca  nut. extracts inhibited the growth of the selected organisms in a concentration dependent manner, baked and boiled nuts being significantly more potent than raw  nut. growth of c. albicans was the least affected by the nut extracts. tannic acid was strongly antibacterial but not catechin or arecoline. no antibacterial effect could be demonstrated on salivary organisms after chewing the nut for 5 minutes but exposure of saliva to the cud for 1 hour caused a significant depression of bacterial growth. it is concluded that the hydrolysable tannins in  the tannin fraction, which include tannic acid, are responsible for the antibacterial properties of the nut and that prolonged intraoral exposure to the  nut can suppress bacteria in the mouth.

TI  == experimental salivary pellicles formed on titanium surfaces mediate adhesion of streptococci.
AB  == the goal of this study was to characterize salivary components of titanium pellicles and to determine how experimental pellicles affect adhesion of several  strains of streptococci to titanium surfaces. titanium experimental pellicles were formed by incubation of fresh human parotid or human submandibular-sublingual saliva on pure titanium beads. pellicle was recovered from the beads using sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer and was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting to identify adsorbed salivary components. streptococcus anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius recovered from in vivo titanium plaque and five reference strains of streptococci were used in adhesion assays to titanium beads with and without experimental salivary pellicles. the experimental pellicle formed on titanium was found to be composed of selected proteins from human parotid and human submandibular-sublingual saliva. salivary alpha-amylase and proline-rich proteins were found in all experimental pellicles, while siga, high-molecular weight mucin, and proline-rich glycoproteins were detected in one of the experimental pellicles examined. adhesion of fresh isolates and reference stains of s. anginosus, s. oralis, and s. salivarius to saliva-coated titanium was reduced compared to that of titanium without saliva coating. however, adhesion of laboratory strains of s. gordonii and s. sanguis was found to be significantly greater to experimental pellicles of human submandibular-sublingual saliva than was the adhesion of the fresh isolates, suggesting that streptococci-colonizing implant surfaces may be inherently less adhesive than other bacterial strains. this study found that salivary pellicles are selectively formed on titanium and mediate in vitro adhesion of streptococci.

AB  == hpr is a low-molecular-mass phosphocarrier protein of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (pep): sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) found in the cytoplasm or associated with the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. treatment of streptococcus suis cells with a sorvall omnimixer, a technique used  to extract cell surface components, resulted in the extraction of a major protein with a molecular mass of 9 kda. several lines of evidence suggested that this protein was hpr: (i) the s. suis protein showed homology over the first 35 n-terminal amino acid residues with the hprs of streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mutans, including the signature sequence for the site of pep-dependent phosphorylation; (ii) it cross-reacted with the s. salivarius anti-hpr antibody preparation; (iii) it could be phosphorylated by enzyme i at the expense of pep, and by a membrane-associated kinase at the expense of atp; and (iv) it possessed phosphocarrier activity when used as a source of hpr in an  in vitro pts assay. the data suggested that a portion of the cellular hpr is associated with the external cell surface in s. suis, a result that was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. the cellular hpr of s. suis consisted of two forms that could be distinguished by the presence or the absence of the n-terminal methionine. amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the cell-surface-associated hpr of s. suis lacked the n-terminal methionine residue.

AB  == this study investigated bacterial penetration of different bacterial shapes, aerodynamic sizes, and flow rates through a surgical mask and a dust/mist respirator. the bacterial penetrations were compared with those of spherical corn oil particles of the same aerodynamic diameter tested under the same conditions.  the tests were performed at different levels of aerosol penetration. bacteria, ranging from spherical to rod-shaped with a high aspect (length to width) ratio,  were selected as test agents. among these, pseudomonas fluorescens physically simulates mycobacterium tuberculosis by shape and size. the concentrations of bacteria upstream and downstream of the test devices were measured with an aerodynamic size spectrometer. this instrument was found to measure the total viable and nonviable bacterial concentration effectively and dynamically over the entire bacterial size range down to 0.5 microns in aerodynamic size. the results  indicate that the spherical corn oil particles and the spherical streptococcus salivarius bacteria have the same penetration in the size range from 0.9 to 1.7 microns. it has been found that rod-shaped bacteria penetrate less. the penetration difference between the spherical and rod-shaped bacteria depends on the aspect ratio of the bacteria. for an aspect ratio of 4, the penetration of rod-shaped bacteria is about half that of spherical ones. thus, it is projected that a respirator with 90% efficiency against spherical microorganisms or test particles (10% penetration) will be 95% efficient against rod-shaped microorganisms of the same aerodynamic equivalent diameter with an aspect ratio of 3 to 4, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis (5% penetration).

AB  == the hydrolysis of urea by urease enzyme of oral bacteria is believed to have a major impact on oral microbial ecology and to be intimately involved in oral health and diseases. to begin to understand the biochemistry and genetics of oral ureolysis, a study of the urease of streptococcus salivarius, a highly ureolytic  organism which is present in large numbers on the soft tissues of the oral cavity, has been initiated. by using as a probe a 0.6-kpb internal fragment of the s. salivarius 57.i urec gene, two clones from subgenomic libraries of s. salivarius 57.i in an escherichia coli plasmid vector were identified. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of one partial and six complete open reading frames which were most homologous to ureiab-cefgd of other ureolytic bacteria. plasmid clones were generated to construct a complete gene cluster and  used to transform e. coli and streptococcus gordonii dl1, a nonureolytic, dental  plaque microorganism. the recombinant organisms expressed high levels of urease activity when the growth medium was supplemented with nicl2. the urease enzyme was purified from e. coli, and its biochemical properties were compared with those of the urease produced by s. salivarius and those of the urease produced by s. gordonii carrying the plasmid-borne ure genes. in all cases, the enzyme had a  km of 3.5 to 4.1 mm, a ph optimum near 7.0, and a temperature optimum near 60 degrees c. s. gordonii carrying the urease genes was then demonstrated to have a  significant capacity to temper glycolytic acidification in vitro in the presence  of concentrations of urea commonly found in the oral cavity. the ability to genetically engineer plaque bacteria that can modulate environmental ph through ureolysis will open the way to using recombinant ureolytic organisms to test hypotheses regarding the role of oral ureolysis in dental caries, calculus formation, and periodontal diseases. such recombinant organisms may eventually prove useful for controlling dental caries by replacement therapy.

TI  == analysis of streptococcus salivarius urease expression using continuous chemostat culture.
AB  == alkali production from urea by bacterial ureases in the oral cavity is thought to have a major impact on oral health and on the physiology and ecology of oral bacteria. using continuous chemostat culture, urease activity in streptococcus salivarius 57.i was examined as a function of growth ph, carbohydrate availability and growth rate. a portion of the s. salivarius urec gene was amplified by polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) using degenerate primers encoding  highly conserved sequences from known ureases. the nucleotide sequence of the pcr product was determined, and was used to compare the level of urease gene expression under different growth conditions. the data indicated that urease was  highly expressed at low ph, and expression was also modulated by glucose availability and growth rate. differential expression was controlled, at least in part, at the transcriptional level.

TI  == myeloencephalitis associated with a viridans group streptococcus in a colony of japanese macaques (macaca fuscata).
AB  == five weaned immature japanese macaques (macaca fuscata), bred in captivity, showed nervous signs over a 12-month period. hemorrhagic cerebral infarcts with vasculitis were detected in four necropsied animals. the distribution and nature  of the lesions were consistent with bacterial embolism, and a streptococcus isolate, biochemically similar to s. salivarius, was recovered from the cerebral  lesions from three of the four necropsied macaques. treatment with antibacterial  agents (enrofloxacin) improved the clinical condition of the surviving affected animal. these observations strongly suggest that this streptococcus spp., member  of the viridans group, is responsible for this outbreak. dental pulpitis, present in two of the four macaques, probably served as the entry for this bacterium.

TI  == a study on prevention of hospital infection control caused by tooth preparation dust in the dental clinic. part 1. preventive measures against environmental pollution in the dental clinic caused by microbial particles.
AB  == tooth preparation dust, an indispensable part of dental treatment, contains bacteria and viruses. in order to examine environmental pollution in the dental clinic during tooth preparation, we monitored microorganism spread by counting colony forming units (cfu) with the "andersen microbe sampler." this test was conducted in a "clean booth." mitis-salivarius medium was used to count the oral-streptococcus species. the ability of the "extra-oral vacuum aspirator (eova)" to effectively eliminate contamination was also tested, and the eova was  found to reduce the spread of oral-streptococci, significantly. the eova was therefore viewed as an effective method for reducing air pollution in the dental  clinic, and should be used when treating patients with certain infectious diseases.

TI  == microbial induction of dentinal caries in human teeth in vitro.
AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus salivarius to induce dental caries was determined in vitro. a class i cavity (depth: 2mm) was prepared in extracted human caries-free premolars to make dentin blocks. the blocks were inoculated with these four bacterial strains in a monoinfective fashion and were incubated under anaerobic conditions. in addition to the monoinfection groups, mixed-infection groups of l. casei with  s. sobrinus or a. viscosus were also prepared. half of the culture medium was renewed every 3 days, and the ph of the medium was measured. after 4 or 12 wk, these dentin blocks were prepared by brown-brenn staining and by contact microradiography for light microscopic observation and for immunohistochemical staining. the final ph of the s. salivarius group was the highest among the experimental groups, at approximately 5.1; that of the others was approximately 4.3. bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules was observed in all but the s.  salivarius group. among the monoinfection groups, the s. sobrinus group showed the highest invasion rate, followed by the a. viscosus group and the l. casei group. the invasion rate was also high in the mixed-infection groups. immunohistochemical staining revealed invasion only by l. casei, and not by s. sobrinus and a. viscosus. the invasion rate by l. casei was higher in the mixed-infection group with either s. sobrinus or a. viscosus than in the monoinfection groups. these findings suggest that lactobacillus might play an important role in the initiation and progress of dentinal caries, and that this bacterial species might exhibit a cooperative cariogenicity when it coexists with other bacterial species that surpasses its individual cariogenicity.

TI  == high sensitivity of mycobacterium species to the bactericidal activity by polylysine.
AB  == bactericidal effects of polylysine on different bacterial species were measured.  marked differences in sensitivity were observed. based on the concentration of polylysine required to reduce cell viability by 50%, mycobacterium smegmatis and  mycobacterium tuberculosis were found to be the most sensitive and escherichia coli the most resistant. in addition, two gram-positive organisms, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius exhibited significant differences in sensitivity which suggests that the relationship between sensitivity towards polylysine and bacterial cell type is not necessarily a function of the overall cell envelope structure. the high sensitivity of mycobacteria suggests the possible use of polylysine, or a conjugate of polylysine and another agent in anti-mycobacterial drug design.

AB  == the transcriptional regulation of the streptococcus salivarius ptsh and ptsi genes coding for the general energy-coupling proteins hpr and enzyme i of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system were investigated. these genes form an operon with the gene order ptsh-ptsi. three distinct mrna species were detected: a 0.5 kb transcript specific for ptsh, and two long transcripts (2.2 and 2.4 kb) covering the whole pts operon. transcription of all these mrnas  initiated at the same nucleotide located 9 bp downstream from a promoter located  immediately upstream from the ptsh gene. the presence of a high-energy stem-loop  structure (t0) located at the beginning of ptsi was responsible for the premature transcription termination generating the 0.5 kb ptsh-specific transcript. the long transcripts ended in the poly(u) region of two rho-independent-like terminators (t1 and t2) at the 3' end of ptsi. studies with a 2-deoxyglucose-resistant spontaneous mutant of s. salivarius (l26) that produces  an hpr-ei fusion protein suggest that the regulation of hpr and ei expression involves transcriptional as well as translational mechanisms.

AB  == the four recombinant glucosyltransferases (gtfs), gtfj, gtfk, gtfl and gtfm, that had previously been cloned from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, were individually expressed in escherichia coli and their glucan products and kinetic  properties were analysed. gtfj was a primer-dependent gtf which synthesized an insoluble glucan composed mainly of alpha-(1-->3)-linked glucosyl residues in the presence of dextran t-10. gtfk was primer-stimulated, and produced a linear soluble dextran without any detectable branch points both in the absence and in the presence of dextran t-10. gtfl was primer-independent and produced a mixed-linkage insoluble glucan composed of approximately equal proportions of alpha-(1-->3)- and alpha-(1-->6)-linked glucosyl residues. gtfl was inhibited by  dextran t-10. gtfm was primer-independent and produced a soluble dextran with approximately 5% alpha-(1-->3)-linked glucosyl residues. gtfm was essentially unaffected by the presence of dextran t-10. the results confirmed that each enzyme represented one of the four possible combinations of primer-dependency and product solubility and that each possessed unique biosynthetic properties. the soluble dextrans formed by gtfk and gtfm, as well as the mixed-linkage insoluble  glucan formed by gtfl, were also capable of acting as primers for the primer-dependent gtfj and the primer-stimulated gtfk. unexpectedly, the linear dextran produced by gtfk was by far the least effective either at priming itself  or at activating and priming the primer-dependent gtfj.

TI  == regulation of atp-dependent p-(ser)-hpr formation in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == sugar transport via the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) phosphotransferase system involves pep-dependent phosphorylation of the general phosphotransferase system protein, hpr, at histidine 15. however, gram-positive bacteria can also carry out atp-dependent phosphorylation of hpr at serine 46 by means of (ser)hpr kinase. in this study, we demonstrate that (ser)hpr kinase in crude preparations of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 is membrane associated, with ph optima of 7.0 and 7.5, respectively. the latter organism possessed 7- to 27-fold-higher activity than s. mutans nctc 10449, gs-5, and ingbritt strains. the enzyme in s. salivarius was activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (fbp) twofold with 0.05 mm atp, but this intermediate was slightly inhibitory with 1.0 mm atp at fbp concentrations up to 10 mm. similar inhibition was observed with the enzyme from s. mutans ingbritt. a variety of other glycolytic intermediates had no effect on kinase activity under  these conditions. the activity and regulation of (ser)hpr kinase were assessed in vivo by monitoring p-(ser)-hpr formation in steady-state cells of s. mutans ingbritt grown in continuous culture with limiting glucose (10 and 50 mm) and with excess glucose (100 and 200 mm). all four forms of hpr [free hpr, p approximately (his)-hpr, p-(ser)-hpr, and p approximately (his)-p-(ser)-hpr] could be detected in the cells; however, significant differences in the intracellular levels of the forms were apparent during growth at different glucose concentrations. the total hpr pool increased with increasing concentrations of glucose in the medium, with significant increases in the p-(ser)-hpr and p approximately hhis)-p-(ser)-hpr concentrations. for example, while total pep-dependent phosphorylation [p approximately(his)-hpr plus p approximately (his)-p-(ser)-hpr] varied only from 21.5 to 52.5 microgram mg of cell protein (-1) in cells grown at the four glucose concentrations, the total atp-dependent phosphorylation [p-(ser)-hpr plus p approximately (his)-p-(ser)-hpr] increased 12-fold from the 10 mm glucose-grown cells (9.1 microgram mg of cell protein (-1) to 106 and 105 microgram mg(-1) in the 100 and  200 mm glucose-grown cultures, respectively. (ser)hpr kinase activity in membrane preparations of the cells varied little between the 10, 50, and 100 mm glucose-grown cells but increased threefold in the 200 mm glucose-grown cells. the intracellular levels of atp, glucose-6-phosphate, and fbp increased with external glucose concentration, with the level of fbp being 3.8-fold higher for cells grown with 200 mm glucose than for those grown with 10 mm glucose. however, the variation in the intracellular levels of fbp, particularly between cells grown with 100 and 200 mm glucose, did not correlate with the extent of p-(ser)-hpr formation, suggesting that the activity of (ser)hpr kinase is not critically dependent on the availability of intracellular fbp.

TI  == sequence, expression, and function of the gene for the nonphosphorylating, nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == we report the sequencing of a 2,019-bp region of the streptococcus mutans ng5 genome which contains a 1,428-bp open reading frame (orf) whose putative translation product had 50% identity to the amino acid sequences of the nonphosphorylating, nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (gapn) from maize and pea. this orf is located approximately 200 bp downstream of the ptsi gene coding for enzyme i of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system. mutant bch150, in which the putative gapn gene had been inactivated, lacked gapn activity that was present in the wild-type strain, thus positively identifying the orf as the s. mutans gapn gene. another strain of s. mutans, dc10, which contains an insertionally inactivated ptsi gene, still possessed gapn activity, as did s. salivarius atcc 25975, which contains an insertion element between the ptsi and gapn genes. since the wild-type s. mutans  ng5 lacks both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and nadh:nadp oxidoreductase activities, the nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is important as a means of generating nadph for biosynthetic reactions.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

TI  == effectiveness of ethylene oxide for sterilization of dental handpieces.
AB  == ethylene oxide gas has been utilized as an alternative method for sterilization of dental handpieces, as it is less corrosive than steam. however, its effectiveness for sterilization of the internal components of dental handpieces has not been established. the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ethylene oxide and steam for sterilization of dental handpieces. unused handpieces and handpieces which had been exposed to clinical dental procedures ('clinical') were contaminated with streptococcus mutans, exposed to steam or ethylene oxide, and flushed with sterile saline. washings were plated on mitis-salivarius agar, and colonies identified and counted. no viable colonies could be established from washings from 'clinical' or 'unused' handpieces exposed to steam. however, viable colonies could be established from 'clinical' handpieces exposed to ethylene oxide. this data suggests that a substance entrapped within 'clinical' handpieces (possibly the biofilm) may protect bacteria from ethylene oxide gas, preventing adequate sterilization.

AB  == we have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by gynecology service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. we achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58  (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to streptococcus morbillorum 9  (15.5%), to gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to enterococcus faecalis-durans and to streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis ii respectively. we previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. the bacteriological identification done by the api 20 strep system (biomerieux gmbh, nutingen, germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the streptococcus morbillorum.

TI  == delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

TI  == differences in the detection and enumeration of mutans streptococci due to differences in methods.
AB  == different methods reported for assessing mutans streptococci (ms) make the direct comparisons of results across studies difficult. to quantitate the variations of  ms estimates attributable to differences in method, stimulated and unstimulated saliva samples and oral swab samples were compared with pooled dental-plaque samples. detection of ms in stimulated saliva samples was in excellent agreement  with the presence of ms in pooled plaque samples. ms detection in unstimulated saliva samples, however, was significantly discordant with that in either pooled  plaque or oral swab samples. when caries status was used as the criterion of validity of ms estimates, stimulated saliva samples demonstrated a sensitivity (94%) similar to that of pooled plaque samples, but exhibited a lower specificity (11%) than that of pooled plaque samples (17%). as a result, the measure of association between ms and caries was biased (towards null) when ms status was based on stimulated saliva samples. interestingly though, in enumerating ms, stimulated saliva samples yielded significantly higher levels of ms (about 1.5 log10 increase) with a lower variability compared to unstimulated saliva samples. the use of different culture media for detection of ms gave different results as  well. ms detection was poor (kappa = 0.31) and ms levels were lower (p = 0.0001)  when samples were grown on glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar compared to mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. together with the relative ease of  sampling and processing, these findings collectively justify the use of plaque samples for the qualitative assessment of ms and stimulated saliva samples for the quantitative assessment of ms, while providing a basis for adjustment of estimates when comparing results across studies.

AB  == we determined the 16s rrna sequences of the type strains of streptococcus mitis and streptococcus gordonii and calculated the phylogenetic distances between those organisms and other members of the genus streptococcus. the viridans group  streptococci were separated into five phylogenetic groups; we named these groups  the anginosus group, the mitis group, the salivarius group, the bovis group, and  the mutans group. s. mitis and s. gordonii clustered in the mitis group together  with streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus parasanguis at levels of sequence homology of more than 96%. within this group, s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. pneumoniae exhibited more than 99% sequence homology with each other, although the dna-dna similarity values for their total chromosome dnas were less than 60%.

TI  == identification of intracellular amylase activity in streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis has been demonstrated to produce an extracellular amylase activity. we previously reported on the cloning of a gene from s. bovis encoding for what was initially believed to be the extracellular amylase. dna sequence analyses indicated that the amylase produced by the cloned  gene did not match the n-terminus amino acid sequence of the purified extracellular amylase and contained no apparent leader sequence for secretion. analyses of crude extracts demonstrated the presence of an intracellular amylase  in s. bovis jb1 that differed in molecular weight (56,000) from that of the extracellular amylase (70,000). the 56,000 molecular weight amylase was identical to the amylase produced by escherichia coli containing the cloned amylase gene. low levels of intracellular amylase activity were also detected in other strains  of s. bovis and also streptococcus salivarius. introduction of the plasmid pva838 containing the cloned amylase gene into s. bovis and s. sanguis resulted in enhanced intracellular amylase production by both organisms. the amylase gene has been sequenced, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence for the amylase indicates a high degree of similarity with secreted amylases from bacillus species.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 possesses at least two genes coding for primer-independent glucosyltransferases.
AB  == fractionation of the culture medium showed that streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 secreted a glucosyltransferase (gtf) that was primer independent. on the basis of this observation, a gene library of s. salivarius chromosomal dna cloned into lambda l47.1 was screened for a gene(s) coding for such an activity. as a result of this screening process, two new gtf genes, gtfl and gtfm, both of which coded for primer-independent gtf activities, were isolated. gtfl produced an insoluble glucan that was refractory to digestion by the endo-(1-->6)-alpha-d-glucanase. of chaetonium gracile, while gtfm produced a soluble glucan that was readily degraded by the glucanase. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of gtfl and gtfm with 10 other available gtf sequences allowed the relatedness of the conserved catalytic regions to be assessed. this analysis showed that the 12 enzymes did not form clusters based on their primer dependencies or on their product solubilities. further analysis of the yg repeats in the c-terminal glucan-binding domains of gtfj, gtfk, gtfl, and  gtfm from s. salivarius showed that there was strong homology between a block of  contiguous triplet yg repeats present in the four alleles. these blocks of yg repeats were coded for by a region of each gene that appeared to have arisen as a result of a recent duplication event(s).

AB  == this study deals with the decontamination of dental turbines and handpieces (dth) aiming at eliminating the cross-infection risk in dental practice. three types of equipment designed for cleaning/lubricating dth were validated. the effect of the three devices was determined for four different types of dth, which were artificially contaminated with streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 in a controlled manner. sampling was carried out by collecting one ml water flushed through the dth connected to a dental unit. the study resulted in a model for testing the decontamination potential of a cleaning/lubrication device for dth. one of the devices could not reduce the contamination, while two others were able to reduce the bioburden with at least 3.9 logarithmic steps. however none of the  devices tested could constantly eliminate the contamination, for which reason an  additional heat treatment of the dth is recommended.

TI  == inhibition of saliva-induced oral streptococcal aggregation by blood group glycoproteins.
AB  == the inhibition of saliva-induced oral streptococcal aggregation with anti-sera (anti-a, anti-b, anti-ab and anti-b treated with galactose), normal human serum (nhs), blood group-specific lectins (uea-i, hba, gpa, bsi-b4, gs-i), non-specific blood group lectins (mpa, sba) and carbohydrates (galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine, l-fucose) was studied. streptococcal species and strains included s. mutans 318, s. mutans 10449, s. mutans ng-8, s. salivarius and s. cricetus hs-6. the saliva was obtained from three subjects with secretor status (2 blood group b persons, 1 blood group a person). the data obtained from experiments performed with s. mutans 10449 and s. mutans ng-8 suggest the involvement of the h-antigenic determinant in the aggregation mechanism of the first strain and of the group b determinant for the second strain. the aggregation of s. salivarius only by b saliva might be related to a galactose-specific lectin on this strain and to some properties of its cell surface (hydrophobicity and the fibrillar surface layer). s. cricetus hs-6 aggregation was inhibited in different degrees by all the inhibitors used. the results demonstrate that interactions between oral streptococci and salivary components depend on the strain and species and on the individual saliva samples.

TI  == adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of oral streptococcal cells.
AB  == oral tissues, especially tooth surfaces, are covered with a layer of salivary proteins. oral bacterial cells that adsorb to salivary components accumulated on  the tooth surface are, as a rule, covered with the same components, especially proteins. thus, it is possible that the salivary proteins covering the bacterial  cells are related to the adhesion of bacteria to oral tissues. the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius using an adsorption  assay with salivary proteins labeled with tritiated formaldehyde. the results showed that salivary proteins adsorbed more to s. salivarius than to s. mitis, and least to s. sanguis. it was evident that hydrophobic bonding was involved in  the adsorption of salivary proteins to the bacterial cells tested. the amount of  salivary proteins adsorbed to s. mitis and s. salivarius was decreased by the presence of phosphate, that to s. sanguis was increased by the presence of a divalent cation such as ca2+, and that to all bacteria tested was inhibited in different ways by the presence of sugars. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed to s. sanguis and s. salivarius was reduced effectively by pretreatment  of the cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin and papain. in the case of s. mitis, the  amount of adsorbed salivary proteins was decreased by pretreatment of the cells with chymotrypsin only, and was increased by pretreatment with lipase. these results indicate that there are different mechanisms of adsorption of salivary protein to the cell surfaces of oral streptococci.

TI  == emergence in human dental plaque and host distribution of amylase-binding streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase is known to bind specifically to several species of oral streptococci. to assess the importance of this interaction in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity, we determined the proportion and identity of amylase-binding bacteria (abb) in dental plaque of humans and various salivary amylase-secreting and non-secreting mammalian species. the numbers of abb in undisturbed plaque collected over time from tooth surfaces of six human volunteers or from 14 other mammalian species were determined by means of a replicating assay. the mean proportion of abb cultured aerobically from human teeth at 2 h was 10.5% (sd 10), at 8 h 7.9% (8), at 24 h 13% (11), and at 48 h 12% (9). the mean proportion of anaerobically cultured abb found at 2 h was 3% (sd 4), at 8 h 5% (5), at 24 h 12% (9), and at 48 h 16% (12). amylase-binding bacteria cultured from these samples resembled streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus crista, or unidentified streptococci. in addition, only animals exhibiting salivary amylase activity in their saliva harbored abb (ranging from 2 to 31% of the total flora), with the exception of the pig, where no abb were found to colonize, despite considerable amylase activity in saliva. only strains resembling s. mitis and s. salivarius and unspeciated strains were isolated from these mammals. these results suggest that amylase-binding streptococci are the predominant abb in human plaque, and their numbers generally increase as plaque develops. since abb colonized only the oral cavities of hosts demonstrating salivary amylase activity, the ability to bind amylase may play an important role in oral colonization by these bacteria.

TI  == aminopeptidase n from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus ncdo 573: purification and properties.
AB  == a 96 kda aminopeptidase was purified from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus ncdo 573. the enzyme had similar properties to aminopeptidases isolated from lactococci and lactobacilli and showed a high degree of n-terminal  amino acid sequence homology to aminopeptidase n from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. it catalysed the hydrolysis of a range of aminoacyl 4-nitroanilides and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and oligopeptides.  in common with aminopeptidases from other lactic acid bacteria, the enzyme from strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus showed highest activity with lysyl derivatives but was also very active with arginyl and leucyl derivatives. relative activity with alanyl, phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, seryl and valyl derivatives was considerably lower and with glycyl, glutamyl and prolyl derivatives almost negligible. the aminopeptidase also catalysed the hydrolysis of dipeptides and tripeptides but mostly at rates much less than that with l-lysyl-4-nitroanilide and oligopeptides. the enzyme catalysed the successive hydrolysis of various amino acid residues from the n-terminus of several oligopeptides but it was unable to cleave peptide bonds on the n-terminal side of a proline residue.

AB  == we have used the toxic non-metabolizable glucose/mannose analogue 2-deoxyglucose  to isolate a comprehensive collection of mutants of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system from streptococcus salivarius. to increase the range of possible mutations, we isolated spontaneous mutants on different media containing 2-deoxyglucose and various metabolizable sugars, either lactose, melibiose, galactose or fructose. we found that the frequency at which 2-deoxyglucose-resistant mutants were isolated varied according to the growth substrate. the highest frequency was obtained with the combination galactose and  2-deoxyglucose and was 15-fold higher than the rate observed with the mixture melibiose and 2-deoxyglucose, the combination that gave the lowest frequency. by  combining results from: (i) western blot analysis of iiiman, a specific component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system in s. salivarius; (ii) rocket immunoelectrophoresis of hpr and ei, the two general energy-coupling  proteins of the phosphotransferase system; and (iii) from gene sequencing, mutants could be assigned to seven classes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == identity of human extra parotid glycoprotein (ep-gp) with secretory actin binding protein (sabp) and its biological properties.
AB  == in this paper the identity of the salivary protein ep-gp (extra-parotid glycoprotein) is reported, also apparent in other human secretions. immunochemical and biochemical analysis demonstrated that ep-gp is similar to the secretory actin-binding protein (sabp), also known as gross cystic disease fluid  protein-15 (gcdfp-15) and prolactin-inducible protein (pip). the molecular mass and charge microheterogeneity of ep-gp, also observed for sabp, was shown to be predominantly caused by the carbohydrate moiety. in addition, evidence was given  that ep-gp is not related to the lipocalin von ebner's gland protein (human; vegh). the biological significance of ep-gp and its homologues is not clear. ep-gp bound to actin and fibrinogen as described for sabp and gcdfp-15. however,  the affinity for these proteins does not appear to have any direct physiological  role in the mucosal secretions. on the other hand, ep-gp binds to several bacteria. by electron microscopy the ultrastructural localization is demonstrated of ep-gp to the cell wall of both streptococcus salivarius hb and its cell appendage-lacking mutant streptococcus salivarius hb-c12. concerning this finding we hypothesize on the possible functional aspects of this enigmatic protein ep-gp.

TI  == direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  == a system for direct screening of recombinant clones in lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (snase) in the organism, was developed. the nuc gene (encoding snase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. l. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete snase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. a multicloning site (mcs) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature snase, without affecting nuclease activity. cloning foreign dna fragments into any site of the mcs interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant  clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. the utility of  this system for l. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and escherichia coli chromosomal dna fragments into the mcs of the nucmcs  cassette. both cloning vectors containing the nucmcs cassette were also introduced into streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. the potential uses  of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.

TI  == is1139 from streptococcus salivarius: identification and characterization of an insertion sequence-like element related to mobile dna elements from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == an insertion sequence-like element, is1139, was cloned and sequenced from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 chromosome. this insertion sequence-like element is 1168 bp long and is delimited by inverted repeats of 29 bp and by a duplicated sequence of 6 bp. this is possesses an open reading frame that codes for a putative transposase of 339 amino acids which has, respectively, 94, 35, 33, and 30% amino-acid identity with the transposases of is1161 from s. salivarius atcc 25975, is4351 from bacteroides fragilis, is30 from escherichia coli, and is1086 from alcaligenes eutrophus. sequence analysis revealed that these transposases may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. southern hybridization of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic dna from 21 strains of oral streptococci, using a probe specific to the transposase-encoding gene (tnpa), revealed that is1139 is found in two strains of s. salivarius, atcc 25975 and atcc 13419, in eight and two copies, respectively.

TI  == definition of a fundamental repeating unit in streptococcal glucosyltransferase glucan-binding regions and related sequences.
AB  == the c-termini of the glucosyltransferases (gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. these glucan-binding domains (gbds) are composed  of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (a-d) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. in contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. according to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. analysis of the gbds of the gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "yg" repeat, could be discerned within the "a", "b", "c", and "d"  repeats. similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the pspa protein of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. analysis of the "yg" repeats present in the gtfj and gtfk of streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "yg" repeats in the gbds of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "yg" repeats.

"milleri" (1), s. pneumoniae (1), s. acidominimus (1), and gemella haemolysans (1). these species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). a count of the gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.

TI  == antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of taleggio, an italian soft cheese.
AB  == enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes. inhibition of l. innocua in milk by  different starter cultures was evaluated. milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h  of taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of l. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of ph decrease and bacteriocin production. overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of taleggio cheese during ripening, when l. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.

TI  == sequence and expression of the genes for hpr (ptsh) and enzyme i (ptsi) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == we report the sequencing of a 2,242-bp region of the streptococcus mutants ng5 genome containing the genes for ptsh and ptsi, which encode hpr and enzyme i (ei), respectively, of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system. the sequence was obtained from two cloned overlapping genomic fragments; one expresses hpr and a truncated ei, while the other expresses a full-length ei in escherichia coli, as determined by western immunoblotting. the  ptsi gene appeared to be expressed from a region located in the ptsh gene. the s. mutans ng5 pts operon does not appear to be linked to other phosphotransferase transport system proteins as has been found in other bacteria. a positive fermentation pattern on macconkey-glucose plates by an e. coli ptsi mutant harboring the s. mutans ng5 ptsi gene on a plasmid indicated that the s. mutans ng5 ei can complement a defect in the e. coli gene. this was confirmed by protein phosphorylation experiments with 32p-labeled phosphoenolpyruvate indicating phosphotransfer from the s. mutans ng5 ei to the e. coli hpr. two forms of the cloned ei, both truncated to varying degrees in the c-terminal region, were inefficiently phosphorylated and unable to complement fully the ptsi defect in the e. coli mutant. the deduced amino acid sequence of hpr shows a high degree of homology, particularly around the active site, to the same protein from other gram-positive bacteria, notably, s. salivarius, and to a lesser extent with those of gram-negative bacteria. the deduced amino acid sequence of s. mutans ng5 ei also shares several regions of homology with other sequenced eis, notably, with the region around the active site, a region that contains the only conserved cystidyl residue among the various proteins and which may be involved in substrate binding.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal action of tachyplesin i against oral streptococci.
AB  == tachyplesin i, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. the present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 streptococcus sanguis, 3 streptococcus mutans, 9 streptococcus  salivarius and 3 streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin i, whereas 9 s. sanguis strains were resistant. interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both kawasaki disease and behcet patients. according to the time-kill study, tachyplesin i inhibited irreversibly  the growth of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. salivarius strains within 20 min and an s. milleri strain within 80 min. although it has been suggested that escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin i, the present results show that only 3 s. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin i in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin i in saline than these were in a rich medium.

TI  == properties of a streptococcus salivarius spontaneous mutant in which the methionine at position 48 in the protein hpr has been replaced by a valine.
AB  == hpr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) that participates in the concomitant transport and phosphorylation of sugars in bacteria. in gram-positive bacteria, hpr is also reversibly phosphorylated at a seryl residue at position 46 (ser-46) by a metabolite-activated atp-dependent kinase and a pi-dependent hpr(ser-p) phosphatase. we report in this article the isolation of a spontaneous mutant (mutant a66) from a streptococcus (streptococcus salivarius) in which the methionine at position 48 (met-48) in the protein hpr has been replaced by a valine (val). the mutation inhibited the phosphorylation of hpr on ser-46 by the atp-dependent kinase but did not prevent  phosphorylation of hpr by enzyme i or the phosphorylation of enzyme ii complexes  by hpr(his-p). the results, however, suggested that replacement of met-48 by val  decreased the affinity of enzyme i for hpr or the affinity of enzyme ii proteins  for hpr(his-p) or both. characterization of mutant a66 demonstrated that it has pleiotropic properties, including the lack of iiilman, a specific protein of the  mannose pts; decreased levels of hpr; derepression of some cytoplasmic proteins;  reduced growth on pts as well as on non-pts sugars; and aberrant growth in medium containing a mixture of sugars.

TI  == conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin g-cross-reactive domains of antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == in this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin g (higg)-cross-reacting domains on the sr molecule,  an antigen i/ii-related protein from s. mutans serotype f. mapping of the sr molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the n-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the sr molecule. in order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans  group and 11 nonmutans oral streptococcus strains (s. anginosus, s. milleri, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. salivarius, and s. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using dna probes  designed to map these two regions. all the mutans group strains except s. rattus  and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the c-terminal part of the sr molecule, especially the higg-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the n-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with sr from s. mutans serotype f, p1 from s. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the higg-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the c  and n termini and in the proline-rich repeats. these results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-igg antibodies.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == glucose stimulates camp accumulation in the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v, a gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 u) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl camp. glucose, on the other hand, stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. fructose  and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on camp accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were  without effect. glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate camp accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. glucose did not stimulate camp levels  in other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and s. salivarius but did cause camp accumulation in other strains of a. viscosus. the results suggest that glucose effects on camp metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the a. viscosus bacteria. the results  also suggest that glucose stimulates camp accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.

AB  == selected strains of oral streptococcus and actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. sensitivities were  initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown  in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/ml to 40 micrograms/ml) than actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml). the most resistant streptococci included s. mitis biovar 1, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and one strain of s. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/ml of mercury. two other s. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/ml mercury. the most resistant actinomyces was a. naeslundii genospecies 1 (atcc12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/ml mercury; two strains of actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml. mercury  caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/ml mercury. mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == amino-terminal methionine processing of the protein hpr in streptococcus salivarius grown in continuous culture.
AB  == hpr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts). streptococci possess two forms of hpr which differ by the presence or the  absence of the n-terminal methionine (met). these forms are called hpr-1 (without met) and hpr-2 (with met). in order to determine whether the ratio of these two forms varies with growth conditions, we measured the amount of hpr-1 and hpr-2 present in streptococcus salivarius grown in continuous culture at ph 7.5. the results indicated that the hpr-1/hpr-2 ratio: 1) was not related to the cellular  amount of total hpr; 2) was highest (10.2 +/- 3.5) under glucose (a pts sugar) limitation (10 mm) and low dilution rate (d = 0.1 h-1; g = 6.9 h); 3) was decreased 2.4- to 5.7-fold when the amount of glucose and/or d was increased; 4)  was not influenced by d when cells were cultured on galactose (a non-pts sugar) but was two-fold higher under conditions of galactose excess (200 mm). we suggest that the cleavage of the n-terminal hpr met is not a stochastic phenomenon but is dictated by growth conditions.

TI  == sequence of the gtfk gene of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 and evolution of the gtf genes of oral streptococci.
AB  == many strains of oral streptococci secrete glucosyltransferases (gtfs) that polymerize sucrose into glucans that form an integral part of the plaque matrix on the tooth surface. recently, we reported the cloning of two closely linked gtf-encoding genes (gtfj and gtfk) from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 as well as the sequence of gtfj, which encodes a primer-dependent gtf that synthesizes an insoluble product (a gtf-i). in this communication we report the sequence of gtfk, which encodes a primer-dependent gtf that synthesizes a soluble product (a gtf-s), as well as the sequence of a small downstream open reading frame of unknown function. the deduced sequence of gtfk was compared with those of seven other streptococcal gtfs and an unrooted phylogenetic tree constructed.  this analysis suggested that gtfs with similar product specificities do not form  phylogenetic clusters and was consistent with currently accepted phylogenetic schemes. the tree was tested by constructing a series of 'sub-trees' from different blocks of the alignment. evidence was obtained for recombination events involving gtfb and gtfc from s. mutans gs-5, gtfj and gtfk from s. salivarius, as well as the gtfi genes from s. downei and s. sobrinus. the recombination events between gtfb and gtfc, and between the two gtfi genes, were confirmed by examining divergences at silent sites.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in management  of experimental infection with group a beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  == the in vivo effects of penicillin and cefprozil therapy on the interaction between organisms commonly recovered from inflamed tonsils were studied by using  a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. these organisms were group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs), streptococcus salivarius (which is capable of interfering with gabhs), and staphylococcus aureus. in mice infected with gabhs and s. salivarius alone or in combination, penicillin eliminated both organisms and cefprozil eliminated gabhs and s. aureus but not s. salivarius. penicillin did not, however, reduce the number of gabhs or s. salivarius in the presence of s. aureus. the present study demonstrated the ability of beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus to protect gabhs from penicillin. however, no such protection was present  following the administration of cefprozil. furthermore, the preservation of s. salivarius that interferes with gabhs growth may provide protection from reinfection with gabhs. this study supports and provides an explanation for the increased efficacies of cephalosporins administered orally over that of penicillin when treating patients with acute gabhs pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the lantibiotic salivaricin a and its structural gene sala from streptococcus salivarius 20p3.
AB  == a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance, salivaricin a, was purified from cultures of streptococcus salivarius 20p3 and was shown by ion spray mass spectrometry to have a molecular mass of 2,315 +/- 1.1 da. amino acid composition analysis demonstrated the presence of lanthionine, indicating that salivaricin a  may be a member of the lantibiotic class of antibiotic substances. the sequence of eight amino acids at the n terminus of the molecule was determined by edman degradation, and mixed oligonucleotide probes based on part of this sequence (gsgwia) were used to detect the salivaricin a structural gene. a 6.2-kb ecori fragment of chromosomal dna from strain 20p3 that hybridized with the probes was  cloned, and the hybridizing region was further localized to a 379-bp drai-alui fragment. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of this fragment indicated that salivaricin a is synthesized as a 51-amino-acid prepeptide that is posttranslationally modified and cleaved to give a biologically active 22-residue peptide containing one lanthionine and two beta-methyllanthionine residues. the secondary structure of presalivaricin a was predicted to be similar to that of type a lantibiotics, with a hydrophilic alpha-helical leader sequence and a propeptide region with potential for beta-turn formation and a lack of alpha-helicity. the sequence around the cleavage site of presalivaricin a differed from that of other type a lantibiotics but was similar to that of several bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == the cell-bound fructosyltransferase of streptococcus salivarius: the carboxyl terminus specifies attachment in a streptococcus gordonii model system.
AB  == the ftf gene, coding for the cell-bound beta-d-fructosyltransferase (ftf) of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, has been analyzed, and its deduced amino acid sequence has been compared with that of the secreted ftf of streptococcus mutans and the levansucrases (sacbs) of bacillus species. a unique proline-rich region detected at the c terminus of the ftf of s. salivarius preceded a hydrophobic terminal domain. this proline-rich region was shown to possess strong homology to the product of the prgc gene from pcf10 in enterococcus faecalis, which encodes a pheromone-responsive protein of unknown function, as well as homology to the human proline-rich salivary protein prp-4. a series of 3'-oh deletions of the s. salivarius ftf gene expressed in streptococcus gordonii challis lgr2 showed that the c terminus was required for cell surface attachment  in this heterologous organism, as only the complete gene product was cell bound.  this cell-bound activity was released in the presence of sucrose, suggesting that the mode of attachment and release of the s. salivarius ftf in s. gordonii was similar to that in its native host.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentinal bonding agents.
AB  == the susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microl each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. of  all the compounds tested, gluma cleanser and gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. no antibacterial effect was noted for prisma universal bond 2 and superlux universal bond 2 systems. the primers of gluma, denthesive, and scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of scotchbond 2 and tripton with streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. no inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of xr-bond on s sanguis and a viscosus was not affected by light curing.

TI  == alterations in the cellular envelope of spontaneous iiimanl-defective mutants of  streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose phosphotransferase  system (ptsman) transports and concomitantly phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose and 2-deoxyglucose. ptsman consists of a membrane enzyme ii and two forms of enzyme iii (iiiman) having molecular masses of 38.9 kda (iiimanh) and 35.2 kda (iiimanl) respectively. we have previously reported the isolation of spontaneous mutants lacking iiimanl, and showed that they exhibited abnormal growth when cultured in mixtures of sugars containing glucose. the mutants also synthesize several cytoplasmic glucose-repressible proteins during growth on glucose and some of them constitutively express a fructose pts which is induced by fructose in the parental strain. we have now investigated the properties and composition of the cellular envelope of three s. salivarius iiimanl-defective mutants (strains a37, b31 and g29) after growth on glucose. the mutants have altered sensitivity to various toxic compounds that interfere with cell-envelope  functions. the mutants also exhibited altered membrane-protein profiles when analysed by two-dimensional page and modified total lipid and phosphorus contents and lipid/protein ratio. in one mutant (strain g29), the proportion of the phospholipids separated by tlc was different from the parental strain. electron microscopy indicated that one mutant (strain a37) possessed more fimbriae than the parental strain. the results suggested that these iiimanl-defective mutants were affected in a global regulatory gene controlling several cellular or physiological functions, many of these being related to the cellular envelope.

TI  == urease activity in streptococcus salivarius at low ph.
AB  == arginine metabolism to alkali by the arginine deiminase system in oral bacteria increases their acid tolerance. the potential of urease activity in streptococcus salivarius to fulfil a similar role was examined. in cell extracts between ph 5.0 and 8.0, urease activity was over 80% the maximal rate. the urease rate was zero  at ph 4.3, and at ph 3.6 the enzyme was rapidly inactivated (t 1/2 of 0.6 min). the ph range of intact cells was broader. in strep. salivarius cells acidified to ph 2.6 for 5 min, urease was completely retained and the ureolytic ph rise was rapid. there was no urease activity after acidification to ph 2. in cells acidified to maintain the ph between 3.3 and 4, viability was maintained for a short period (extrapolation indicated 20 min) and then decreased. this acidification induced alkali generation or acid removal that decreased in parallel to loss of viability. a small fraction (10%) of the urease was rapidly inactivated, after which both the remaining urease and ph response decreased at a similar rate to cell viability (t 1/2 of 15-20 min), but for at least 1 h following acidification, a rapid ureolysis induced rise in ph to above 7. in cells held at ph 3.6 and treated to compromise their membranes by freeze-thawing  or transient acidification to ph 2.3, 70-80% of the urease was lost rapidly and the remainder inactivated at a rate similar to that in intact cells. therefore, although at ph below 4, s. salivarius urease is outside its ph activity range and the free enzyme is rapidly inactivated, intact cells the urease is protected and  ureolytic generation of ammonia is capable of substantially raising the ph for at least 1 h while the cell population is being progressively killed by acid.

TI  == inhibition of platelet binding and aggregation by streptococcal exopolysaccharide.
AB  == streptococcal exopolysaccharides are major virulence factors in the pathogenesis  of endocarditis. they promote bacterial adherence to valves and subsequent vegetation formation. since platelet binding and aggregation by streptococci are  postulated mechanisms for endocardial colonization and vegetation production, the effect of exopolysaccharide on binding and aggregation was evaluated by flow cytometry and aggregometry. streptococcus salivarius d1, a minimal exopolysaccharide producer, bound human platelets extensively (86.8% of bacteria  bound by 1 min). s. salivarius m13 and m15 and streptococcus mitis m4 produced larger amounts of exopolysaccharide and bound platelets significantly less (52.6%, 51.2%, 52.8%, respectively). exopolysaccharide also inhibited platelet aggregation: strains with minimal exopolysaccharide aggregated platelets maximally, while strains with extensive exopolysaccharide failed to induce aggregation. removal of exopolysaccharide by shearing restored aggregation by these latter strains. thus, exopolysaccharides can inhibit the binding and aggregation of platelets by streptococci. the virulence associated with exopolysaccharide may result from the inhibition of platelet-mediated interactions that limit disease progression.

TI  == the ftf gene encoding the cell-bound fructosyltransferase of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 is preceded by an insertion sequence and followed by fur1 and clpp homologues.
AB  == analysis of the region downstream of the ftf gene of streptococcus salivarius led to the detection of two open reading frames (orfs). the deduced amino acid sequences of these orfs were homologous to proteins encoded by genes not previously described and/or sequenced in gram-positive bacteria. the deduced amino acid sequence of the first of these (orf2) showed strong homology to the product of the fur1 gene of saccharomyces cerevisiae, which codes for a uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. the over-expression of the product of this gene appeared to be the source of the detrimental effect observed with phagemids carrying orf2 in escherichia coli hosts. the deduced amino acid sequence of the second orf (orf3) was homologous to the clpp family of proteases. examination of  the upstream region of the ftf gene led to the discovery of a new insertion sequence-like element which has been designated is1161.

TI  == longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. this study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, oscn-, siga and total protein. colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to streptococcus sanguis, strep.  mutans or strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the api rapid strep identification system. consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, strep. sanguis and strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. significant pearson correlations with strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), siga (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and oscn- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins;  the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. these findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. they also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. this  study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.

TI  == altered expression of several genes in iiimanl-defective mutants of streptococcus salivarius demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cytoplasmic proteins.
AB  == mannose, glucose and fructose are transported in streptococcus salivarius by a phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system (pts) which consists of a membrane-bound enzyme ii (eii) and two forms of iiiman having molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and 35,200 (iiimanl), respectively. we have previously reported the isolation of spontaneous mutants lacking iiimanl and showed that they exhibit higher beta-galactosidase activity than the parental strain after growth on glucose, and that some of them constitutively express a fructose pts which is induced by fructose in the parental strain. in an attempt to determine whether the expression of other genes is affected by the mutation and what the physiological link is between them, we examined three s. salivarius iiimanl-defective mutants (strains a37, b31 and g29) and the parental strain using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis after growth of the cells on a variety  of sugars. after growth on glucose, five new proteins were detected in the cytoplasm of the three mutants. two of these proteins were induced in the parental strain by galactose or oligosaccharides containing galactose, and one was specifically induced by melibiose. the other two proteins were not detected in the parental strain under any of the growth conditions tested. two other proteins were only detected in glucose-grown cells of mutant a37, and a protein associated with the metabolism of fructose was constitutively expressed in mutants b31 and g29. moreover, we have found that under identical growth conditions the amounts of several other proteins which were detected in the parental strain were either increased or decreased in the mutants. globally, our  results have indicated that (1) the expression of several genes was affected in the spontaneous iiimanl-defective mutants; (2) some of the proteins abnormally produced in the mutants were specifically induced in the parental strain by sugars; (3) the phenotypic modifications observed in the mutants were of two types: most were observed solely after growth of the cells on glucose whereas the others were glucose-independent; and (4) the mutants shared common phenotypic traits, but also exhibited idiosyncratic characteristics.

AB  == ph changes in human dental plaque in vivo from lactose and milk have been studied in four separate mouthrinse experiments. (1) ph was measured in plaque samples of 12 subjects before and after 6 weeks of frequent daily mouthrinsing with 10% lactose. the ph decreases were significantly more pronounced after the adaptation period than before (p < 0.001), 4 of the 12 subjects showing about the same low plaque ph from lactose as from glucose. (2) similar to the previous experiment, frequent daily mouthrinsing with low-fat bovine milk in 10 subjects resulted in more pronounced ph decreases in plaque after an adaptation period of 4 weeks (p < 0.001). (3) single mouthrinses, without any prior adaptation, with bovine standard milk, human breast milk, lactose-hydrolysed bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 5% sucrose were compared regarding the effect on plaque ph in 7 subjects. all solutions resulted in ph falls. the most pronounced were found with sucrose, followed by the lactose-hydrolysed milk. (4) bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 10% sucrose were compared after a single mouthrinse in 5 subjects using interdental plaque ph wire telemetry. lactose and milk were fermented more  slowly than sucrose. in a separate study, acid production from lactose was also measured in two oral strains each of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis. the results from these experiments indicated that at least part of the lactose transport and catabolism in all studied streptococcus strains seems to be regulated by inducible enzymes.

AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prevalence of dental caries in 4- to 5-year-old children partly explained by presence of salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == the correlation between dental caries and the number of oral mutans group streptococci (ms) present has been shown to be weak. the aim of this investigation was to study associations between caries experience (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces [dmfs]) and the number of ms in stimulated saliva, with emphasis on the level of disease and the confounding effect of regular intake of sweets, the presence of salivary lactobacilli, and oral hygiene. in some 2,700 4- to 5-year-old south african children of different ethnic origins, caries was diagnosed on the basis of world health organization criteria and saliva samples were analyzed for ms after cultivation on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and for lactobacilli by using the dentocult kit. oral  hygiene was scored on the basis of the greene and vermillion simplified debris index, while data on intake of sweets were derived from extensive interviews. pearson's coefficient of correlation was computed, and multiple regression analysis was performed to correct for confounding factors. the distribution of the children in the eight caries classes was strongly associated with the ms class (p < 0.001), with those in the lower ms classes generally having low dmfs scores and those in the higher ms classes having dmfs scores distributed over the whole range. the r value for the two variables was 0.25 for the total material; this was reduced to 0.18 by correction for confounding factors. the corresponding values for children with caries were 0.21 and 0.17, for those in the 1 to 6 dmfs  interval they were 0.07 and 0.03, and for those in the 7 to 81 dmfs interval they were 0.16 and 0.14. the data imply that the explanatory values for ms, those for  the lower caries interval not counted, ranged from 6 to 2%. the unexpected results for children with caries might be due to their distribution pattern. it is concluded that there is a need for reevaluation of ms as a risk factor in dental caries.

TI  == emergence of immune competence in saliva.
AB  == saliva contains essentially no iga at birth. however, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. we have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. antibody specificities (iga, iga1, and iga2) were measured in elisa and western blot analysis to antigens of streptococcus mitis and s. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. antibodies reactive with s. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. the secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. the primary molecular form of salivary iga was dimeric in all salivas tested. both iga subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% iga1. igm (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. by 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained iga antibody reactive with at least two s. mitis components. many salivas also contained antibody reactive with s. salivarius components. by the end of the first year, most salivas contained iga1 and iga2 antibody to s. mitis  antigens. maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary iga antibodies to s. mitis antigens. antibody to s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == physico-chemical and structural properties of the surfaces of peptostreptococcus  micros and streptococcus mitis as compared to those of mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the surface properties of nine streptococcus mitis and four peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. in addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. the s. mitis and p. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher n/c surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. the combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. all the s. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the p. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms  in the two species. the surfaces of s. mitis and p. micros type strains differed  significantly from the other strains examined.

TI  == dental caries and its determinants among recent immigrants from rural ethiopia.
AB  == adults (35-45 yr old) and children (5 and 12 yr old) recently arrived in israel from rural areas in ethiopia were examined. caries levels were low: e.g. dmft = 0.31 among 12-yr-olds, and 1.27 amongst adults. the 5-yr-olds were 86.8% caries-free, while 12-yr-olds were 81.8% and adults 54% caries-free respectively. according to interview data, the diet in ethiopia had been based on local agricultural products and was almost sugar-free. the mean total count of salivary bacteria, as determined on blood agar, was 3.4 x 10(8); mean count of streptococcus viridans, on mitis salivarius, was 6.7 x 10(7); and mean count of s. mutans, as determined on mitis salivarius with bacitracin, was 1.7 x 10(7). these levels were all high and were not significantly different from a control group of 20 israelis. the mean number of lactobacilli, on rogosa agar, was 2.75 x 10(4), which was significantly higher than among the controls (3.6 x 10(3). salivary ph levels were generally similar between the ethiopian group and the controls. salivary flow was significantly higher for the ethiopians (1.93 ml/min) than for controls (1.16 ml/min). low levels of caries in this population can be attributed to an almost sugar-free diet and high salivary flow, but not to the composition of oral microflora.

TI  == immunoglobulin a antibody activity to mutans streptococci in parotid, submandibular and whole saliva.
AB  == antigen extracts of 9 strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis were separated in acrylamide gels by electrophoresis. strains of the same genotype of mutans streptococci were found to have virtually identical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns but differed clearly from other genotypes of mutans or with the reference strains s. salivarius and s. mitis. immunoglobulin a (iga) antibody activity to antigens of s. mutans, s. sobrinus and s. mitis in the parotid, submandibular and whole saliva of 12 people was detected by western blotting. iga antibodies reacted with several of the antigens, and the reaction pattern was unique for each of the individuals. to certain antigens, all the salivas blotted bands if both clear and questionable bands were counted. significantly more blotted bands were revealed with antigens from s. mutans than  s. sobrinus. the results of the 3 different salivas of the same individual had a  high degree of resemblance but in a few individuals, more blotted bands were obtained with parotid saliva to s. mutans and s. sobrinus antigens.

AB  == the alpha-streptococci, consisted of normal oral flora mainly, with inhibitory activity against pathogenic microbes in healthy individuals was investigated by group a streptococcus (indicator strain 6-22 nonmucoid t-12). rate of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against group a streptococcus was increased as aging, and the rate in pre-school children was higher than that in school children. these results suggested that more than 90% of the tested alpha-streptococci with strong inhibitory activities (s. salivarius) against indicator strain had inhibitory activities against group a streptococcus (mucoid  t-6), h. influenzae, s. pneumoniae, group c streptococcus, and from 40% to 70% of the tested strains had also inhibitory activities against other pathogens. as there were many strains of alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activities against  pathogens, that usually detected in the upper respiratory infection, the problem  on the strains in the future will explain significance of the defense mechanism against upper respiratory infection and this can be applied clinically.

AB  == we present the cloning and sequencing of the ptsi gene, encoding enzyme i (ei) of the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep): sugar phosphotransferase (pts) transport system from streptococcus salivarius. the ptsi gene corresponds to an open reading frame of 1731 nucleotides, which translates into a putative 577-amino acid (aa) protein with a m(r) of 62,948 and a pi of 4.49. the ei was produced in escherichia coli under the control of its own promoter located immediately upstream of ptsi, a situation never previously reported for any other gene coding for an ei. the deduced aa sequence of the s. salivarius ei shows a high degree of similarity with the e. coli ei and the ei moiety of the multiphosphoryl transfer protein from rhodobacter capsulatus. the s. salivarius ei also shares a highly conserved  aa cluster with a non-pts protein, the maize pyruvate:orthophosphate dikinase. the conserved cluster is located in a domain which is hypothesized to be the pep-binding site.

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus mutans gs-5 frua gene encoding exo-beta-d-fructosidase.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (frua) and flanking regions of the chromosome of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was determined. the frua gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. the presumed precursor of the secreted frua protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an m(r) of 158,656 and a pi of 4.82. the n terminus of frua has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. the c  terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide lpdtgd, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the lpxtgx consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci.  the frua protein has significant homology with the bacillus subtilis levanase (sacc), the bacteroides fragilis levanase (scrl), yeast invertases, and a number  of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. genes with homology to frua were detected in s. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, streptococcus rattus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis. a deletion derivative of frua lacking the c-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. the data begin to define functional domains of the frua protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.

TI  == different bacteriophage resistance mechanisms in streptococcus salivarius subsp.  thermophilus.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus strain nst5 exhibited a temperature-dependent defence mechanism against the virulent bacteriophages phi b1.2 and phi a1.1. it was active at 42 degrees c but not at 30 degrees c as demonstrated by a significant increase of both plaque size and efficiency of plaquing. this defence mechanism did not affect host-dependent phage replication  and did not interfere with phage adsorption to nst5. these results suggest that it interfered with phage development. the phages phi t33, phi t58, phi d1, phi t21 and phi t9, belonging to the same phage type as phi b1.2, were examined for their ability to infect nst3 and nst5. restriction modification systems of different specificity were detected in nst3 and nst5; host-dependent phage replication was detected at 30 and 42 degrees c; an abortive defence mechanism was detected in nst5 which was active at 42 degrees c, but not 30 degrees c, and  was independent of restriction modification action or interference with phage adsorption. our investigations of phage-host interactions showed that the two str. salivarius subsp. thermophilus strains studied avoided attack by related bacteriophages by evolving at least three different resistance systems.

TI  == processes involved in the regulation of urease levels in streptococcus salivarius by ph.
AB  == urease levels in streptococcus salivarius are regulated by ph. there is either increased synthesis at low ph (5.5) or enhanced degradation at neutral ph, suggested by urease instability during stationary phase. to establish which mechanism predominates, protein synthesis was inhibited by chloramphenicol (cap)  in cultures grown at ph 5.8, 6.8 and 7.3. there was no significant urease degradation detectable in mid-exponential and early-stationary phase at any ph. urease degradation occurred in both control and cap cultures later in stationary  phase, but with a faster rate of decline in the low ph culture. after cap addition there was detectable assembly of urease from pools of post-translational subunits to give an approximately 20% increase in enzyme. above ph 7, 0.1% cysteine inhibited urease synthesis but not growth, and evidence was obtained for o2 inhibition of growth and urease synthesis. regulation of urease levels in s. salivarius by ph primarily involves an effect on urease synthesis. there may be cross-regulation between ph control, anaerobiosis-controlled enzyme regulatory circuits and thiols.

TI  == growth interaction between candida albicans and streptococcus salivarius: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  == suppression of candida albicans in the mouth by oral flora has been proposed as one of the mechanisms preventing candidal overgrowth. according to liljemark and  gibbons (1973), streptococcus salivarius plays a significant role in this process. the aim of this investigation was to study the growth interaction between c. albicans and s. salivarius in vitro and in vivo. an aerobic continuous-flow system was used for the in vitro study. pure and mixed cultures of c. albicans (ncpf 3118) and s. salivarius (nctc 8618) were inoculated into a buffered medium containing either 0.1 per cent or 0.001 per cent glucose concentrations and incubated at 37 degrees c for 55 hours. two in vivo investigations were undertaken using inbred germfree c3h mice. in the first, mice were exposed to a mixed suspension of s. salivarius and c. albicans for 48 hours. in the second the mice were exposed to s. salivarius for 48 hours. fourteen days  later they were contaminated with c. albicans. a comparison of growth curves showed no growth inhibition between the species. the in vivo studies showed that  oral lesions from candidal infestation occurred in all mice. we were therefore unable to demonstrate in vitro or in vivo suppression of c. albicans in the presence of s. salivarius.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the 3' part of a ribosomal and transfer rna locus from streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus nst1403 was determined. the sequenced dna fragment includes the 3' end of a 23s rrna gene, a 5s rrna gene, a trna(asn)  gene and a potential transcriptional terminator. the trna gene does not encode for the cca 3'terminus of mature trna. we compared this sequence to a promoter-carrying dna fragment sequence (p20) of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus a054 [1]. we found that the p20 sequence included the 3' end of a 23s rrna gene, a 5s rrna gene and the 5' part of a trna(val) gene. the two 23s-5s spacer sequences are identical and contain a promoter and a potential 23s rrna processing site. therefore, 5s rrna and trna genes could be transcribed from a promoter located within the 23s-5s spacer of at least two of the six rrna loci.

AB  == we have reported previously that the phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system (mannose pts) of streptococcus salivarius, consisting of an enzyme ii mannose (eiiman) and two forms of enzyme iii mannose (iiiman) with mr values of 38,900 and 35,200, respectively, concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, as well as glucose and fructose. in this paper, we report the presence, in s. salivarius, of alternative specific fructose and glucose ptss encoded by inducible and cryptic genes, respectively. protein phosphorylation experiments conducted with [32p]phosphoenolpyruvate have allowed us to identify by sds-page and autoradiography the eii fructose (eiifru) (mr 57,500) and the eii glucose (eiiglc) (mr 58,700). no proteins corresponding to iiifru or iiiglc could be detected. eiifru phosphorylated fructose on the c-1 position rather than, as with the constitutive mannose pts, on the c-6 position. growth on fructose resulted in the induction of eiifru as well as an increase of 1-phosphofructokinase activity. nevertheless, the genes encoding these proteins were independently regulated. studies carried out with spontaneous mutants lacking the low-molecular-mass form of iiiman (mutants a37, g29 and b31) showed that eiifru was expressed in glucose-grown cells of strains g29 and b31, but not  in strain a37, whereas the cryptic gene encoding eiiglc was activated in all three mutant strains. the results obtained with the mutants suggest that the three spontaneous mutants were not all mutated on the gene encoding iiiman although all of them lacked iiiman.

AB  == the article deals with interactions between bio-vitro-materials and bacteria species in vitro. the growth of s. aureus, sc. salivarius, e. coli and ps. aeruginosa in a salt solution with and without addition of biomaterials was examined until the day 60 in a static culture. by counting the cfu/ml and determination the relative change of germ capacity the results were compared. the data of such series obtained with working materials of similar chemical composition were collected and evaluated. we found, that ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. the same can be said about the last materials and e. coli. in contrast as well ca- and p-containing as--free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. changes  of multiplying of s. aureus and sc. salivarius seldom were observed. it ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. this may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. it is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application. materials with indifferent behavior or low anti-microbiological effect have to be favoured.

TI  == use of a replica-plate assay for the rapid assessment of salivary protein-bacteria interactions.
AB  == a replica-plate assay was used to screen for the interaction of salivary molecules with dental plaque bacteria. bacterial colonies cultured from supragingival plaque on sheep-blood (sb) agar were replica-plated onto nitrocellulose membranes overlaying sb or mitis-salivarius agar. membranes with attached colonies were removed and incubated with 125i-amylase or 125i-proline-rich glycoprotein (prg). positive interactions were detected by autoradiography. only strains of streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces viscosus  bound amylase, and strains of a. viscosus bound prg. the results suggest that amylase and prg bind to selected species of aerobic dental plaque bacteria.

TI  == depth profiling of the elemental surface composition of the oral microorganism s. salivarius hb and fibrillar mutants by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
AB  == x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) on microbial cell surfaces requires freeze-drying of cells, and as a result, the cell surface appendages flatten out  on the cell surface and form a collapsed fibrillar mass. at present, it is unclear how the density, length and composition of these fibrils influence the elemental surface composition as probed by xps. the sampling depth of xps can be  varied by changing the electron take-off angle. in this article, we made a depth  profiling of the collapsed fibrillar mass of streptococcus salivarius hb and fibril-deficient mutants by angle-dependent xps. methylamine tungstate negative staining and ruthenium red staining followed by sectioning revealed distinct classes of fibrils with various lengths on each of the strains. interpretation of the angle dependence of the oxygen/carbon (o/c) and phosphorus/carbon (p/c) surface concentration ratios of these strains was difficult. however, the angle dependence of the nitrogen/carbon (n/c) surface concentration ratio could be fully interpreted: n/c did not vary with sampling depth on a bald strain, s. salivarius hbc12 and on s. salivarius hb7, a strain with a dense array of fibrils of uniform length. n/c decreased with sampling depth in case of a sparsely fibrillated strain, s. salivarius hbv51 and eventually reached the value observed for the bald strain, hbc12. a high n/c at small sampling depth was observed for s. salivarius hb with protruding, protein rich fibrils. we conclude that elemental depth profiling of microbial cell surfaces by xps can be interpreted to coincide with structural and biochemical information on the cell surface as obtained by electron microscopy and can therefore be considered as a useful technique to study structural features of cell surfaces in combination with electron microscopy.

TI  == oral ofloxacin therapy for lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  == we made an open, noncomparative evaluation of ofloxacin, 400 mg orally bid for 10 days, in 98 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia or pathogen-confirmed bronchitis. thirty-nine (40%) of the subjects were treated in the hospital and 59 (60%) were treated as outpatients. the mean age of those treated was 56.2 years;  73 (74%) of the subjects either were more than 60 years old or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both. there were 95 organisms initially isolated in sputum, aspirate, or lavage fluid; all were susceptible to ofloxacin, and none acquired resistance during therapy. haemophilus influenzae was the most  common pathogen (19 isolates), followed by streptococcus pneumoniae (18) and staphylococcus aureus (10). clinical responses included cure in 70 patients (71%), improvement in 26 (27%), and failure in two (2%). after 10 days of therapy, pathogens persisted in two cases; in one case, streptococcus salivarius  was isolated, though it remained susceptible to ofloxacin, and in the other, klebsiella pneumoniae was accompanied by superinfection due to a resistant strain of serratia marcescens. we included in this study three confirmed cases of atypical pneumonia successfully treated with ofloxacin, two of them due to mycoplasma pneumonia and one to legionella pneumophila. ofloxacin was well tolerated. our data indicate that ofloxacin is effective and safe as specific and empiric treatment for many lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  == multibacterial artificial plaque. a model for studying carious process.
AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

TI  == radiofrequency gas plasma (glow discharge) disinfection of dental operative instruments, including handpieces.
AB  == the radiofrequency-stimulated argon gas plasma (glow discharge) technique, already well-known for surface cleaning and activation of adhesion, was investigated for determination of its separate potential for rapid disinfection of dental operative instruments. disinfection effectiveness was judged from diminished post-treatment recovery of viable organisms from the instruments agitated in saline. streptococcus salivarius, bacillus stearothermophilus, and escherichia coli were used as primary contaminant organisms, dried from gelatin-thickened laboratory cultures onto the instruments and not subjected to any preliminary cleaning steps. significant disinfection was obtained, with no sensible temperature increases, in under 10 minutes in laboratory apparatus consuming fewer than 5 watts of power per cycle. also, clinically used and deliberately-saliva-contaminated high-speed handpieces were gas-discharge-treated, with their resultant rapid disinfection noted by complete  suppression of the viability of any transferred natural contaminant organisms within two minutes. with regard to preservation of instrument quality, it was also shown that this low-temperature gas-discharge method provides the noted substantial disinfection without deterioration of sharp edges. work now in progress suggests that the method can provide cool, rapid, and complete sterilization when hydrogen peroxide vapors are present in the gas plasma used for treatment of instruments first given the normally recommended thorough pre-cleaning.

TI  == strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  == lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. to evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of s thermophilus, l bulgaricus, l acidophilus, or bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. all yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. the response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with b bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with l bulgaricus milk. the results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.

AB  == we report the cloning in escherichia coli of the gene encoding an extracellular endodextranase (alpha-1,6-glucanhydrolase, ec 3.2.1.11) from streptococcus salivarius pc-1. recombinants from a s. salivarius pc-1-lambda zap ii genomic library specifying dextranase activity were identified as plaques surrounded by zones of clearing on blue dextran agar. one such clone, pd1, had a 6.3-kb ecori fragment insert which encoded a 190-kda protein with dextranase activity. the recombinant strain also produced two lower-molecular-mass polypeptides (90 and 70 kda) that had dextranase activity. native dextranase was recovered from concentrated culture fluids of s. salivarius as a single 110-kda polypeptide. pd1 phage lysate and pc-1 culture supernatant fluid extract were used to measure substrate specificity of the recombinant and native forms of dextranase, respectively. analysis of these reaction products by thin-layer chromatography revealed the expected isomaltosaccharide products yielded by the recombinant-specified enzyme but was unable to resolve the larger polysaccharide  products of the native enzyme. furthermore, s. salivarius utilized neither the substrates nor the products of dextran hydrolysis for growth.

AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

TI  == effects of a 1% chlorhexidine gel on the cariogenic bacteria in high-risk elders: a pilot study.
AB  == root caries in dentate elderly patients is a problem which may be controlled with chlorhexidine. the purpose of this pilot study was to establish the extent and duration of the antimicrobial effects from an intensive regimen of a 1% chlorhexidine gel in institutionalized elders who had experienced high caries activity in the previous year. stimulated saliva samples from all subjects before treatment produced more than 105 colony forming units/milliliters of streptococcus mutans (mean: 2.0 x 10(7); s.d.: 2.0 x 10(7)) when diluted and cultured on mitus salivarius-bacitracin agar for 48 hours. findings suggest that  daily treatments for 1 week with a 1% chlorhexidine gel can reduce the number of  cariogenic bacteria in elderly people for approximately 3 weeks after treatment.

TI  == isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  == a promoter probe vector, ptg244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from streptococcus thermophilus (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). ptg244 is based on the escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector ptg222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. random sau3a fragments from the s. thermophilus a054 chromosomal dna were cloned  upstream of the cat-86 gene by using e. coli as the host. the pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into s. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. for s. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in l. lactis subsp. lactis. six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in s. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription  and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. the 5' ends of their corresponding mrnas were determined by s1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the e. coli sigma 70 and the bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43  (or sigma a) consensus promoters were identified.

TI  == the presence of two forms of the phosphocarrier protein hpr of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococci.
AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == association between the 65-kilodalton heat shock protein, streptococcus sanguis,  and the corresponding antibodies in behcet's syndrome.
AB  == the etiology of behcet's syndrome (bs) is unknown, but a number of streptococcal  species have been implicated. a hypothesis was postulated that a shared antigen,  such as a stress protein, might account for some of these findings. indeed, a rabbit antiserum against a 65-kda heat shock protein of mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed a corresponding 65-kda band with all six streptococcus sanguis strains examined and s. pyogenes but not with s. salivarius. by applying  a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies to the mycobacterial 65-kda heat shock protein, an approximately 65-kda antigen was identified in the uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis st3 and h.83 and one with a different mr was identified in kth-1 and s. pyogenes. monoclonal antibodies y1.2, c1.1, ii h9, and ml30, which reacted with these streptococci, recognize residues 11 to 27, 88 to 123, 107 to 122, and  276 to 297 of the 65-kda heat shock protein, respectively, suggesting that these  residues are conserved among some uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis and s. pyogenes. immunoblot analyses of sera from patients with bs for immunoglobulin a  (iga) and igg antibodies revealed bands of 65 to 70 kda with the mycobacterial heat shock protein, s. sanguis strains, and s. pyogenes, although these reactivities were also found to a lesser extent in controls. a 65- to 70-kda band was found more frequently with s. sanguis kth-2 or kth-3 and iga in serum from patients with bs than with serum from controls (p less than 0.02). antibodies in  serum were then studied by a radioimmunoassay, and in patients with bs this revealed significantly raised iga antibodies to the recombinant 65-kda mycobacterial heat shock protein and to soluble protein extracts of s. sanguis st3, kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3. whereas significant anti-65-kda heat shock protein  and anti-s. sanguis st3 antibodies were also found in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent oral ulcers, the anti-s. sanguis kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3 antibodies were confined to bs. the results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the streptococcal antigens are associated with heat shock or stress proteins, which will need to be formally established by isolating heat  shock proteins from streptococci.

TI  == effect of calcium ions on cell surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria.
AB  == surface electrostatics of bacteroides gingivalis and other oral bacteria were examined. a polarization circuit was employed using platinum electrodes exposed in each bacterial suspension and the number of bacteria adsorbed to the anode and cathode were then estimated. in all bacteria (b. gingivalis, streptococcus sobrinus, s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus), the number of cells adsorbed to the anode were much greater than the number of cells  adsorbed to the cathode. treating these bacteria with calcium ions tended to decrease the ratio of the number of cells adsorbed to the anode to the number of  cells adsorbed to the cathode in all bacteria examined. moreover, in the case of  b. gingivalis, the number of cells adsorbed to the anode and cathode was in an inverse relationship to the number counted before calcium ion treatment. these findings indicate that the cell surfaces of oral bacteria are generally negatively charged but only the cell surface electrostatics of b. gingivalis was  dramatically affected by calcium ion treatment. thus, divalent metal bridges such as calcium bridges contribute to the adherence of the periodontopathic bacterium, b. gingivalis rather than to that of other oral bacteria including cariogenic bacteria.

AB  == a total of 157 isolates of mutants streptococci from plaque and saliva of 94 children were studied for their serotypes, mutacin production, frequency and spectrum of activity. of these isolates 71% were identified as serotype c and 22% as serotype e. serotypes f, d and g, and one untypable strain made up about 7% of the isolates. more than one serotype was found in 13% of the children. mutacin was produced by 83% of the isolates against one or more of the 14 indicator strains representing mutants streptococci. streptococcus sanguis, strep. oralis,  strep. gordonii, strep. salivarius and strep. pyogenes. isolates that had a broad inhibitory spectrum also produced larger inhibition zones than isolates that inhibited fewer strains. when evaluating the effect of mutacin in vivo on plaque  ecology, it was found that the counts of mutans streptococci or the proportion of mutans streptococci in the total streptococcal count of plaque did not differ between plaques containing strains that produced much mutacin and those with little production. the findings also failed to reveal an association between caries experience and mutacin activity.

TI  == on salivary film formation and bacterial retention to solids. a methodological and experimental in vitro study.
AB  == a parallel-plate flow cell system was developed to assess individual and combined parameters relevant to oral microbial retention. in this system, internal reflection germanium prisms represented oral solid surfaces including tooth surfaces. the system used, allowed adsorbed protein films to be analyzed in situ  by multiple non-destructive surface analytical techniques, without provoking surface associated biofilms. using a range of biochemical and biophysical techniques, germanium prisms of medium critical surface tension were noted to accurately model film formation at tooth-saliva interfaces. a range of clinically relevant temperatures (22 and 37 degrees c), rinse shear rates (1 and 32 ml/min)  and critical surface tensions (high, medium and low) were systematically tested in the flow-cell system for their influence, if any, on salivary microbial retention from whole human saliva. comparisons of the interfacial organization of adsorbed material were made between human parotid (hps) and submandibular-sublingual (hsmsl) salivas. the influence of these salivary secretions was also tested on the retention capacities of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius. microbial retention was found to be significantly dependent on initial critical surface tensions and rinse flow rates, but not to be affected by tested temperatures. when compared to prisms of low and high critical surface tension, medium critical surface tension prisms retained the highest numbers of microorganisms. no statistically verified morphological selectivity was observed in the retained microbial populations. when the interfacial organizations of hps and hsmsl were evaluated at low- and medium energy surfaces in the absence and presence the streptococci, comparatively thinner and denser films with pronounced bacterial retention was noted for hps on prisms of low critical surface tension. in the presence of saliva or salivary fractions, no difference in retention capacities was observed between the tested  bacterial strains. the data suggest that in the presence of saliva, physico-chemical and mechanical factors have a major influence on the short term  microbial retention to solid surfaces. the amount of salivary proteins being initially retained to a material also seems to be more directly related to the critical surface tension quality of the solid than to the type of bacterial strain present in suspension. the empirical critical surface tension of a material is thus a useful predictor of both microbial retention capacities and primary interactions between saliva and solid surfaces.

TI  == partial characterization of the glucosyltransferases of an oral streptococcus salivarius strain.
AB  == the oral streptococcus salivarius strain s3 possessed extracellular glucosyltransferase (gtf) and cell-associated fructosyltransferase activities. chromatofocusing column chromatography of crude gtf yielded multiple peak fractions, which were categorized into two types which catalysed (1) water-insoluble glucan synthesis and (2) water-soluble glucan formation. the gtf  isozyme eluted in fraction 29 synthesized mutanase- and dextranase-sensitive insoluble glucan from sucrose, while fraction 81 gtf synthesized soluble glucan which was insensitive to both glucanases. the ability to agglutinate streptococcus sobrinus cells was high for insoluble glucan but negligible for soluble glucan. the insoluble glucan-synthesizing activity of fraction 29 gtf was inhibited by the presence of dextran t10. isoelectric focusing yielded a single activity band but sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave multiple bands for  both gtf fractions 29 and 81. the extracellular crude gtf activity was inactivated by 0.1% sds or 1% tween 80, but the activity was completely restored  by the addition of 1% triton x-100.

TI  == multilevel control of extracellular sucrose metabolism in streptococcus salivarius by sucrose.
AB  == standardized experimental conditions were established to test the role of sucrose in the regulation of control of its metabolism in streptococcus salivarius. a fresh isolate of s. salivarius was used. the extracellular dextranase activity of cells grown on sucrose was 10-fold higher than that of cells grown on glucose, fructose or galactose. this activity increased in less than 5 min following the addition of sucrose to galactose-grown cells, a phenomenon which was affected by  neither rifampicin nor chloramphenicol which inhibit transcription and translation, respectively. extracellular fructanase activity was 2-fold higher when cells were grown on sucrose than when they were grown on the other sugars. this increase also occurred within 5 min, but was diminished by transcriptional and translational inhibitors. de novo synthesis was required for the production of extracellular glucosyltransferase (gtf) activity which, upon the addition of sucrose, became associated with the cell surface. conversely, cell-associated fructosyltransferase (ftf) activity appeared to require genetic induction for its production and cell-surface association, but required sucrose for its release from the surface framework. versatility in the control mechanisms of this complex set of enzymes allows their expression and function to be regulated at several widely separated stages in the life histories of these proteins.

AB  == sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. when sucrolose  was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar ph falls, compared with controls. the incorporation of 126 mmol/l sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, streptococcus sanguis 10904, streptococcus sanguis challis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus wvu627. sucralose had no effect on ips production. sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent  of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. no radioactive polymer was formed from 14c-u-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (gtf) or fructosyl-transferase (ftf). inhibition of gtf and ftf by sucralose was  removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. these results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on gtf and ftf was non-competitive and reversible. the results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). in order to determine their immune response to s. pyogenes t4, s. pyogenes t12, s mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp, ct, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. blastoid transformation was investigated by [3h] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin g following the addition of s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii s. mitis, s. pyogenes t4, and s. pyogenes t12, while those form ct patients and controls did so only with s. pyogenes t4 and s. pyogenes t12. 2. the spontaneous production of specific igg against various streptococci, including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp was already higher than that from ct patients and controls. the specific igm  production was also increased above that in ppp patients without any antigens. 3. s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific igm production in tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients. 4. the levels of specific igg production against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii by tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the ppp patients. these results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially s. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-s. sanguis antibodies in patients with ppp, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == direct observations of cooperative effects in oral streptococcal adhesion to glass by analysis of the spatial arrangement of adhering bacteria.
AB  == the spatial arrangement of two strains of oral bacteria adhering on glass was studied in order to investigate cooperative effects in their adhesion mechanisms. streptococcus salivarius hb was a strain which possessed several classes of fibrillar surface appendages, whereas on the cell surface of s. mutants ns no surface appendages could be identified. the bacteria were deposited from a flowing suspension with various buffer concentrations on the bottom glass plate of a parallel plate flow cell and were observed directly with a video camera mounted on a phase contrast microscope. the positions of all adhering bacteria were determined by means of automated real time image analysis and subsequently employed for calculating radial and angular pair distribution functions. pair distribution functions indicate the average relative number density of bacteria around one deposited bacterium as a function of the radial distance or the angular orientation relative to the flow direction. from the calculated pair distribution functions of both bacterial strains it was concluded that cooperative effects contributed to the adhesion of s. salivarius hb, but not to adhesion of s. mutants ns. it was suggested that these cooperative effects originate from the surface appendages of s. salivarius hb.

TI  == sialidase activity of the "streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.

TI  == effect of tif4 solutions on bacterial growth in vitro and on tooth surfaces.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the antimicrobial effect of tif4 as compared with equimolar solutions of naf, apf, and snf2 and to evaluate the effect, if any, on bacterial growth on topically treated tooth surfaces. in an in vitro study, paper discs impregnated with 20 microliters of equimolar solutions of snf2, naf, apf, and tif4 were placed on blood agar plates seeded with streptococcus mutans and bacteroides gingivalis. sterile saline was used as control. similar growth inhibition zones were found for all fluorides. in the second part of the study six volunteers carried intraoral appliances containing enamel and root surface specimens treated with 1% tif4 and untreated specimens for 18 h. scanning electron microscopic examination of the experimental tooth surfaces showed great variation in bacterial growth between subjects, but no systematic difference between fluoride-treated and untreated specimens. bacteria  from test and control specimens were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on blood agar and on mitis salivarius agar. colony-forming unit counts showed great interindividual variations, but no differences could be observed between treated and untreated enamel or root surfaces. thus, the hypothesis that the presence of a ti-rich coating may influence bacterial colonization on tif4-treated tooth surfaces could not be substantiated.

TI  == [investigation of the bacterial flora in the tonsillar lacunae and serum levels of streptococcal antigen-specific antibodies in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == ph regulation of urease levels in streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == potential mechanisms for regulation of urease levels in streptococcus salivarius  were examined, including: induction by urea, nitrogen or carbon source repression, and effects of ph and co2 (because co2 enrichment enhanced urease detection on urea agar plates). regulation by either ph or co2 was confirmed by comparison of the urease accumulation pattern during anaerobic growth under co2 with that under n2. under co2, there was an initial buffering plateau at ph 6.2 and a rate of streptococcus salivarius urease accumulation three-fold that under  n2, with a ph 7.6 plateau. with both gas phases there was also an increase in the rate of urease appearance coincident with the decrease in medium ph following the ph plateau. the effects of ph, co2, and hco3- on urease levels and on growth were separately assessed by culture in media containing 0, 25, 100 mmol/l khco3 buffered at different ph levels. there was an inverse relationship between the logarithm of the urease level after 24-hour growth and the ph during growth-the urease specific activity was 100-fold higher at ph 5.5, compared with ph 7.0 and  above. hco3-/co2 (100 mmol/l) had little effect on urease levels, but was essential for growth at ph 5.5. there was no significant urease induction by urea, or repression by ammonia or glucose. there was also evidence of ph regulation of urease levels in some staphylococci, klebsiella pneumonia, and corynebacterium renale, but not in actinomyces naeslundii and several other species. we conclude that the external ph is a major factor regulating urease levels in s. salivarius and possibly some other species-a mechanism equivalent to urease repression by oh-.

AB  == glucosyltransferase (gtf) activity in batch cultures of streptococcus sanguis strain challis in defined medium was maximum at peak growth and declined rapidly  on further incubation into stationary phase. activity was present in spent culture medium and was associated with 2 polypeptides of approximate mrs 170 kda  (90% of activity) and 155 kda (about 10% of activity). other s. sanguis strains produced similar antigenically-related polypeptides but with varying activities,  and antibodies to the s. sanguis enzyme did not react with enzymes produced by other species of oral streptococci. increasing the [na+] reduced gtf production by s. sanguis strains challis and nctc 7865, and by streptococcus sobrinus, but not by streptococcus salivarius. addition of tween 80 to cultures caused a rapid  inhibition of gtf synthesis by strain challis, but not by strain nctc 7865. benzyl alcohol had a slower and less inhibitory effect on gtf production by strain challis. tween 80 generally inhibited to varying degrees gtf production by other oral streptococci through in s. sobrinus it was stimulated. the results suggest controls operating on gtf synthesis and secretion by different strains of oral streptococci appear to be diverse.

AB  == salivary iga antibodies to oral streptococci which colonize the infant oral cavity soon after birth were analyzed in 53 whole salivas of 17 infants who were  between three and 27 weeks old. antibody activities to streptococcus mitis cells  were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in 78% of the whole salivas by the twelfth week of age. this antibody activity was associated with polymeric iga as determined after gel filtration of salivas on superose 6, followed by elisa. western blot analyses were used to detect iga antibodies to streptococcus mitis and streptococcus salivarius culture supernatants. forty one, and 91% of saliva samples contained iga antibody which reacted in western blot analyses with s. salivarius and s. mitis culture supernatants, respectively. the youngest infant to show reactive iga antibody with either oral streptococcal antigen preparation  was five week old. salivary iga antibody to either bacterial culture supernatant  was detected in western blot only after the isolation of the respective streptococcal species from the oral cavity of these young infants. some heterogeneity was observed among patterns developed with salivas from different infants. these results suggest that salivary iga antibody responses may be induced by oral colonization (s. mitis, s. salivarius) by the end of the first month of life.

TI  == oral adhesion of yeasts.
AB  == oral adhesion of yeasts probably occurs by interaction between yeast cell adhesins and oral epithelial cell receptors. in candida albicans mannoprotein, glucan, chitin, cell wall proteins, and lipids are possible adhesins. mannoprotein appears as a fibrillar or floccular outermost layer in stationary-phase cells grown in sugar-rich medium. preincubation of buccal epithelial cells (becs) with concanavalin a inhibits adhesion, as does suppression of mannoprotein production by tunicamycin. germ tubes adhere more easily to becs and plastic than do blastospores. methyl-alpha-d-mannoside may be  analogous to the yeast adhesin or epithelial cell receptor because it inhibits adhesion of c. albicans to becs. l-fucose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, or d-mannose,  having the same effect, may also function as epithelial cell receptors. other factors affecting yeast adhesion may be fibronectin, hydrophobicity, s-iga, and indigenous bacteria. growth of yeasts to stationary phase in sugar-rich media promotes adhesion to acrylic, as do divalent cations and serum. saliva, chlorhexidine, and streptococcus salivarius inhibit adhesion of yeasts.

AB  == a chlorhexidine (1%)-sodium fluoride (0.2%) gel applied using a dental tray six times during two consecutive days significantly decreased salivary levels of mutans streptococci but had only a slight effect on salivary levels of lactobacilli. the same gel used as a dentifrice for one week (twice a day) also significantly reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci. however, this treatment was somewhat less effective than that using trays, on the basis of the  ratio of mutans streptococci to total aerobes. with both treatments baseline salivary levels of mutans streptococci were re-attained after 70 days. one day after the gel treatment, mutans streptococci were unable to adhere to plastic strips (dentocult sm strip mutans) but detectable growth was found on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. this suggests that not only are numbers of mutans streptococci reduced after chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel treatment but also mutans streptococci adherence.

TI  == isolation and some properties of extracellular glucan-producing strains of human  oral streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == a total of eighteen strains of streptococcus salivarius, which formed rough gelatinous, rough mucoid or smooth mucoid colonies on sucrose agar media, were isolated from the saliva and tongue dorsum of adults. all of the isolates produced glucans as well as fructans from sucrose. the bulk of the glucans was synthesized by the extracellular enzyme fraction and was water insoluble, whereas most of the fructans were synthesized by the cell-associated enzyme fraction and  were water soluble. all strains formed microbial deposits on wire and glass surfaces when cultured in sucrose broth, but their sucrose-dependent adhesion was apparently looser than that produced by a cariogenic s. sobrinus strain. the rough gelatinous colony forming strains possessed a greater ability to synthesize water-insoluble glucans and produced heavier deposits with higher cohesion. preliminary studies showed that the s. salivarius of such characteristic forms of colony were detected primarily in the saliva and tongue dorsum: the smooth mucoid colony formers appeared to predominate in the tongue coat and the rough mucoid and rough gelatinous colony formers were prominent in saliva. isolation of these  s. salivarius from dental plaques was low.

TI  == secretion of fructosyltransferase by streptococcus salivarius involves the sucrose-dependent release of the cell-bound form.
AB  == three strains of streptococcus salivarius including a recent clinical isolate were found to possess ca2(+)-dependent fructosyltransferase (ftf) activity. the extracellular ftf activity of cells grown on sucrose increased as much as 9-fold  compared with cells grown on either glucose, fructose or galactose. this increase in activity was due not to induction of ftf by sucrose, but to the release of the cell-bound form of the enzyme. studies with washed cells of s. salivarius atcc 25975 showed that the extent of release of the cell-bound ftf activity was dependent upon the sucrose concentration up to 4 mm, at which concentration maximum release (95%) of cell-bound ftf occurred. several lines of evidence suggested that either substrate binding or de novo synthesis of fructan is required for the release of the cell-bound ftf activity.

TI  == production and partial characterization of the extracellular polysaccharides from oral streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the production of polysaccharides from sucrose by extracellular enzymes from oral streptococcus salivarius isolates and the physico-chemical properties of water-insoluble products (ips) were investigated. extracellular enzymes from all  the 18 strains tested produced insoluble alpha-d-glucans (igs) as well as soluble beta-d-fructans, and formed adhering deposits on glass. generally, the ips (mostly igs) of s. salivarius strains differed from the s. sobrinus ips by (a) containing significant proportions of alpha-d-(1----4)-, in addition to alpha-d-(1----3)- and alpha-d-(1----6)-glucosyl linkages, and much higher proportions of alpha-d-(1----3) than alpha-d-(1----6) linkages, (b) being more susceptible to hydrolysis by mutanase than by dextranase, (c) possessing low or no streptococcal cell-agglutinating ability, and (d) showing weaker adhesion to a glass surface. the degree of the polysaccharide adherence differed greatly among  the s. salivarius strains and, therefore, they were divided into three groups of  adherence producers; heavy, moderate, and slight. the ips of the three groups contained, generally in descending order, a higher proportion of higher-molecular-weight fractions, and consisted of higher proportions of ig containing higher proportions of -(1----6)-alpha-d and -(1----4)-alpha-d glucosyl linkages and (1----3,6) branches, but showed higher susceptibility to hydrolysis  by mutanase as well as dextranase. thus, the production and the properties of extracellular insoluble alpha-d-glucans from sucrose differ considerably between  oral s. salivarius and cariogenic s. sobrinus.

AB  == streptococcus salivarius hb and four adhesion deficient mutants, hb-7, hb-v5, hb-v51 and hb-b, were grown in continuous culture in a defined medium under glucose limitation over a range of growth rates from 0.1 to 1.1 h-1. the ability  to coaggregate with veillonella parvula v1 cells and the ability to adhere to buccal epithelial cells did not alter with increasing growth rate. cell surface hydrophobicity decreased markedly with increasing growth rate for the non-fibrillar non-adhesive mutant hb-b but not for the other four strains which all carry different combinations of fibril classes. the thickness of the ruthenium red staining layer (rrl) also varied with growth rate for strain hb-b,  ranging from 19.5 +/- 3.8 nm at high growth rate to a minimum of 12.3 +/- 4.8 nm  at low growth rate. low cell surface hydrophobicity correlated with a thicker rrl for strain hb-b. strains hb-v5 and hb-7 also showed a significant increase in rrl thickness at high growth rates although to a lesser degree than hb-b. sds-page revealed a large number of protein bands common to all strains at all growth rates, with the major common protein occurring at 15.6 kda. protein bands at 70,  56, 40.5 and 39 kda appeared stronger at high growth rates than at low. a protein band at 82 kda showed strongly only at low growth rates. therefore, adhesion and  coaggregation are not phenotypically variable with increasing growth rate but rrl thickness, hydrophobicity and cell surface proteins may be phenotypically variable depending on the strain.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to composite resin restorative materials.
AB  == the frequency of oral streptococcal bacterial isolates detected on composite resin squares attached to maxillary first molars in 12 volunteers was 62.1 per cent. these cocci consisted of streptococcus mitior (52.8 per cent), s. sanguis (20.2 per cent), s. oralis (8.6 per cent), s. salivarius (1.0 per cent) and s. anginosus (0.3 per cent). an electron microscopic study of these organisms labelled with [3h]thymidine for in vitro adhesiveness to the resin revealed that  s. mitior was the most adhesive, and that its pronounced adhesiveness is associated with its characteristic extracellular ultrastructure.

TI  == streptococcus mutans, not detected?
AB  == the growth of streptococcus mutans was followed for three years in 24 healthy 12-17 year-old children, who were selected for the study on the basis of undetectable levels of salivary s. mutans. the saliva samples were cultured by a  dip-slide method based on mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with sucrose and bacitracin. at the final occasion, additional examination of plaque and saliva of 10 children using tsy20b agar was performed. during the 3-year study period, s. mutans was found in saliva samples from 15 children on one or more of the 4 test  occasions, suggesting that most 's. mutans negative individuals' were those in whom s. mutans could not be temporarily detected. the additional examination of plaque did not increase the number of 's. mutans-positive individuals'.

TI  == prevention of bacterial adhesion to denture acrylic.
AB  == a range of non-toxic polysaccharides were screened for their ability to prevent bacterial adhesion to denture acrylic in vitro. sodium alginate, karaya gum and carrageenan were found to be the most effective, reducing adhesion of streptococcus salivarius by 98.7, 97.9 and 99.2 per cent respectively. these three polysaccharides were then tested for their ability to reduce the number of  bacteria adhering to dentures in vivo. sodium alginate was the most effective, reducing the attachment of bacteria to the palate-contacting surface of the denture after 5 h of normal wear by 84 per cent compared with uncoated controls.  the results of this investigation suggest that the accumulation of denture plaque may be prevented by frequent application of a renewable, sacrificial coating of a non-toxic polysaccharide.

TI  == molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == in order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in kbr was used. all infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (ch), 1653 cm-1 (ami), 1541  cm-1 (amii) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. however, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the ch stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. both streptococcus mitis strains possess high ami/ch and amii/ch absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. streptococcus salivarius hbc12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower  ami/ch and amii/ch band ratios with respect to its parent strain s. salivarius hb. two positive relationships could be established both between the amii/ch absorption band ratio and the n/c elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and also between ami/ch and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by xps as well. from this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.

TI  == dissimilar effects of na+ and k+ on the promotion of glucosyltransferase secretion in streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == a defined growth medium (designated ap11), in which the concentrations of na+ and k+ could be altered independently of one another, was developed for streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975. the addition of 100 mm-na+ to ap11-medium containing 25 mm-k+ initially reduced the rate of expression of extracellular glucosyltransferase (gtfe). however, once s. salivarius had adaptated to grow in  the presence of 100 mm-na+, the rate of gtfe expression was stimulated. in fact once adapted to the presence of na+ in the environment the same increase in the rate of enzyme expression was observed in all batch cultures irrespective of the  k+ concentration (2-50 mm). at 2 mm-k+ there was no change in the level of saturation of the membrane lipids when the na+ concentration was increased from 0 mm to 100 mm. na+-stimulation of gtfe expression was confirmed in non-proliferating cell suspensions at different k+ concentrations. in non-proliferating cell suspensions, gtfe expression outlined a rectangular hyperbola with respect to k+ concentration when the k+ concentration was stepped  up from 2 mm. the increase in gtfe synthesis and secretion was transient and was  similar to that previously reported by us in na+-rich medium, though it did not reach the same high levels. the reduced transient stimulation of gtfe expression  correlated both with an enrichment in the saturated fatty acids of the membrane lipids of s. salivarius, and with the fact that the degree of saturation was only slightly reduced when the k+ concentration was stepped up from 2 mm to 50 mm. needless to say, the final octadecenoic to octadecanoic (c18:1/c18:0) fatty acid  ratio retained its direct correlation with the transient increase in gtfe production following the step up in k+ concentration, giving rise to an apparent  biphasic plot when combined with that previously reported.

TI  == inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus salivarius and colonization of the upper respiratory tract with group a streptococci.
AB  == it has been proposed that inhibitory substances produced by viridans streptococci colonizing the upper respiratory tract aid in eradication of established group a  streptococcal colonization of that site. we studied the prevalence of inhibitory-substance producing strains of streptococcus salivarius in throat cultures from three groups of children: 16 children with persistently positive throat cultures for group a streptococci despite receiving recommended therapeutic courses of antibiotics (group i), 26 children from whom group a streptococci were eradicated from the upper respiratory tract by antibiotic therapy (group ii), and 18 children who never harboured group a streptococci in their upper respiratory tract during the study period (group iii). an in vitro deferred antagonism method was employed to detect inhibitory substances; 5233 strains of s. salivarius were examined. strains of s. salivarius producing inhibitory substances were isolated from 76-88% of the children in each group on  at least one occasion. however, only a small percentage of subjects in each group harboured strains producing these substances in every throat culture. the mean total percentage of s. salivarius strains producing inhibitory substances was 21.8% in children in group i, 22.4% in children in group ii, and 16.4% in children in group iii; these percentages were not statistically different (p greater than 0.1). in this study, we could not confirm a significant role for inhibitory substances produced by s. salivarius in the eradication of group a streptococci from the upper respiratory tract of colonized individuals.

TI  == a physiological classification of viridans streptococci by use of the api-20strep system.
AB  == physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the api-20strep system and a selection of conventional tests. cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of colman and williams. the organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--streptococcus mutans, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and s. milleri. analysis confirmed that s. mitior and s. sanguis can be distinguished in the api-20strep test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production.  although s. mutans, s. mitior and s. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. with this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. api-20strep is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.

TI  == cariogenicity of a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient mutant of streptococcus mutans serotype c in gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient (ldh-) mutant of a human isolate of streptococcus mutans serotype c was tested in a gnotobiotic rat caries model. compared with the wild-type ldh-positive (ldh+) strains, it was significantly (alpha less than or equal to 0.005) less cariogenic in experiments with two different sublines of sprague-dawley rats. the ldh- mutant strain 044 colonized the oral cavity of the test animals to the same extent as its parent strain 041,  although its initial implantation was slightly but not significantly (p greater than or equal to 0.2) less. multiple oral or fecal samples plated on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium indicator medium revealed no evidence of back mutation from ldh- to ldh+ in vivo. both ldh+ strain 041 and ldh- strain 044 demonstrated  bacteriocinlike activity in vitro against a number of human strains of mutans streptococci representing serotype a (s. cricetus) and serotypes c and e (s. mutans). serotypes b (s. rattus) and f (s. mutans) and strains of s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were not inhibited. thus, ldh mutant strain 044 possesses a number of desirable traits that suggest it should be investigated further as a possible effector strain for replacement therapy of dental caries. these traits include its stability and low cariogenicity in the sensitive gnotobiotic rat caries model, its bacteriocinlike activity against certain other  cariogenic s. mutans (but not against more inocuous indigenous oral streptococci), and the fact that it is a member of the most prevalent human serotype of cariogenic streptococci.

TI  == bacteremia with streptococcus bovis and streptococcus salivarius: clinical correlates of more accurate identification of isolates.
AB  == two biotypes of streptococcus bovis can be identified by laboratory testing and can be distinguished from the phenotypically similar organism streptococcus salivarius. we assessed the clinical relevance of careful identification of these organisms in 68 patients with streptococcal bacteremia caused by these similar species. s. bovis was more likely to be clinically significant when isolated from blood (89%) than was s. salivarius (23%). there was a striking association between s. bovis i bacteremia and underlying endocarditis (94%) compared with that of s. bovis ii bacteremia (18%). bacteremia with s. bovis i was also highly  correlated with an underlying colonic neoplasm (71% of patients overall, 100% of  those with thorough colonic examinations) compared with bacteremia due to s. bovis ii or s. salivarius (17% overall, 25% of patients with thorough colonic examinations). we conclude that careful identification of streptococcal bacteremic isolates as s. bovis biotype i provides clinically important information and should be more widely applied.

AB  == cells of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly  to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. entrapped cells of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. the kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by l. lactis subsp. lactis and s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.

TI  == aspects of dental plaque formation with special reference to colloid-chemical phenomena.
AB  == in order to investigate factors of importance for plaque formation and the rate of plaque formation 133 randomly selected individuals went through a 3-day period of plaque accumulation. from these individuals one group of "heavy" and one group of "light" plaque formers were selected for further studies. these subjects were  investigated with reference to clinical, biochemical, biophysical and microbiological variables, that in the literature have been suggested to influence plaque formation. the collected data were analysed statistically both by comparisons between the two groups and by multiple regression. in the comparative analyses there were only minor differences between the groups, and no single studied variable was considered as the only explanation to the great difference in the amount of plaque formed after 3 days between "heavy" and "light" plaque formers. the multiple regression showed that the initial bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces was dependent on the clinical wettability of tooth surfaces, the saliva-induced aggregation of oral bacteria and finally the relative salivary flow conditions around the tooth surfaces where the bacterial samples were collected. on basis of these results, it was suggested that saliva and oral bacteria could at least partly be looked upon as being a biological colloid system system. further studies were designed to investigate whether oral  bacteria could be regarded as colloid particles or not, and to study the properties of saliva as a colloid suspending medium. these studies showed that bacteria suspended in different salt solutions were dependent on ph, ionic concentration and the valency of the cations in the solutions to be able to aggregate. the aggregating capacity further seemed to be specific for different bacterial species and strains. addition of saliva from "heavy" and "light" plaque formers influenced the colloid stability of bacteria suspended in water in different ways. saliva from "light" plaque formers gave a lower colloid stability in suspensions of a plaque-forming bacterium (streptococcus sanguis) as compared  to the addition of saliva from "heavy" plaque formers. no such differences were observed in suspensions of s. salivarius, which is normally not a plaque-forming  bacterium. the results indicate that colloid-chemical processes might be involved in bacterial attachment to tooth surfaces, and that initial bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces at least partly follow general biophysical laws.

TI  == ruthenium red staining reveals surface fibrils and a layer external to the cell wall in streptococcus salivarius hb and adhesion deficient mutants.
AB  == ruthenium red staining revealed both the long and short classes of cell surface fibril in thin sections of streptococcus salivarius hb, indicating that the fibrils contained polyanionic polymers, probably polysaccharides. also visible was a 16.2 +/- 2.2 nm thick ruthenium red staining layer (rrl) outside the 16.7 +/- 2.2 nm thick cell wall. the fibrils could not be seen after conventional glutaraldehyde and osmium fixation. the rrl was protease resistant and was not involved in septum formation. loss of the fibrils after protease treatment coincided with a decrease of 54% in cell surface hydrophobicity, indicating that  cell surface hydrophobicity was due partly to fibrils and partly to the rrl. there was no correlation between the lengths of fibrils as measured on whole cells after negative staining and on thin sections of ruthenium red stained cells. the thickness of the rrl was the same in three adhesion deficient mutants--strains hb-7, hb-v5 and hb-v51--with various fibril lengths. however, a  completely bald mutant, hb-b, had a significantly thicker rrl than s. salivarius  hb, although it was unable to adhere to buccal epithelial cells, and it could not co-aggregate with veillonella parvula v1. the rrl therefore did not contain adhesins.

AB  == the primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. all 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were veillonella atypica or veillonella dispar. all but one of them coaggregated with strains of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. these tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the  subgingival flora such as actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus sanguis. in contrast, 24 of 29 veillonella isolates, of which 20 were veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of actinomyces, s. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with s. salivarius. the majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. these results indicate that the three human oral veillonella species  are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.

AB  == the api 20s (analytab products, plainview, ny), the gpi card (vitek systems, st.  louis, mo) and the rapstr system (innovative diagnostics, atlanta, ga) were compared with conventional biochemicals for the identification of viridans streptococci. one hundred nine clinical isolates were tested that included the following species: intermedius (38) sanguis ii (20), bovis (variant) (14), mitis  (14), salivarius (11), sanguis i (6), constellatus (3), mutans (2), and uberis (1). with initial testing, a correct species call was made with 72% of the isolates with the gpi card, 62% with the rapstr, and 50% with the api 20s. identifications of viridans streptococci group or those that needed additional biochemicals for species identification occurred with 28% of isolates with the api 20s, 8% with the rapstr, and 9% with the gpi card. incorrect identifications  occurred with 6% of the isolates tested by the gpi card, 20% with the api 20s, and 30% with the rapstr. most discrepancies with the rapstr were with 66% of the  intermedius isolates, whereas most, 55%, of misidentifications with the api 20s were with sanguis ii isolates. no identifications were made with 2% and 13% of isolates with the api 20s and gpi, respectively.

TI  == [biological characterization of ecovars of gram-negative bacteria circulating in  the burn ward].
AB  == in 44 isolated cultures of gram-negative bacteria, besides commonly known pathogenicity factors, their adhesive activity towards the cells of the buccal epithelium and their interrelations with the representatives of normal microflora which determine natural resistance to colonization have been studied. the artificial adhesion of target cells is accompanied by the inhibition on the natural colonization of epithelial cells by streptococcus salivarius; it is, therefore, evident that adhesiveness is one of the factors which determine the behavior of microorganisms in cenoses. the circulation of adhesive strains of gram-negative bacteria has been noted in the burn ward.

TI  == [interferon production and natural killer activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis].
AB  == interferon (ifn) -system of patients with multiple sclerosis (ms) during the stable stage of the disease activity was investigated. thirty six patients were divided into 3 groups of mild, moderate and severe patients according to the scores of disability status scale (dss). ifn-alpha producibility and natural killer (nk) activity of peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) or large granular lymphocytes (lgl) fractionated from pbl were determined by culturing with hela cells persistently infected with measles virus (hela/mv) and k562 cells. ifn-gamma was induced in pbl obtained from the patients using killed cells of propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes), listeria monocytogenes (lm) and streptococcus salivarius (str. sal.) and a lectin of concanavalin a (con a). both ifn-alpha producibility and nk activity of pbl obtained from the patients were depressed in parallel with the severity of dss of the patients. the depressed nk activity of the patients could be recovered by neither ifn-alpha nor interleukin-2 added exogenously. in addition, the induction of ifn-gamma was also depressed in the patients in response to p. acnes and lm, but not str. sal. or con a. these results suggest that the defect of ifn-system observed in pbl of the patients may result from the depressed function of both lgl and t lymphocyte subpopulations which are responsive to p. acnes and lm. it is postulated that these immunocompetent cells might migrate to subclinical demyelinating lesions of central nervous system where cytokines including ifn-gamma were produced locally, and that their migration might result in the quantitative decrease of lymphocytes participating in ifn-system in pbl of patients with ms.

TI  == surface properties of streptococcus salivarius hb and nonfibrillar mutants: measurement of zeta potential and elemental composition with x-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy.
AB  == to characterize the functional cell surface, the zeta potentials and elemental surface composition of streptococcus salivarius hb and a range of mutants with known molecular surface structures were determined. zeta potentials of fully hydrated cells were measured as a function of ph in dilute potassium phosphate solutions, yielding isoelectric points of the strains. elemental composition (o,  c, n, and p) of the outer 2 to 5 nm of the freeze-dried cell surfaces were measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. an increasing loss of proteinaceous fibrillar surface antigens of the mutants was found to be accompanied by a progressive decrease in the n/c ratio from 0.104 in the parent strain hb to 0.053 in mutant hbc12. simultaneously, the value of the isoelectric point shifted from  3.0 to 1.3. in a previous study (a.h. weerkamp, h.c. van der mei, and j. w. slot, infect. immun. 55:438-455, 1987) on the cell surfaces of the same strains, it was shown that removal of fibrils led to increased exposure of (lipo)teichoic acid at the surface, which explains the low isoelectric point caused by the low pka of the phosphate groups.

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.

AB  == vancomycin-resistant streptococcus salivarius-like bacteria were isolated from the blood and gastrostomy tube of a 6-month-old child during vancomycin therapy for staphylococcus epidermidis central venous catheter-associated bacteremia. the isolates produced d-(-)-lactate and ethanol from glucose, hydrolyzed esculin, and produced no ammonia from arginine, thus fulfilling the major criteria as leuconostoc spp. the enzymatic profile of the bacteria suggested that they were not lactobacilli or streptococci. resistance to vancomycin and penicillin tolerance were noted. the formula fed through the gastrostomy tube was suspected  as the vehicle that transmitted the organism to the patient. penicillin and tobramycin therapy was used successfully.

TI  == cross-sectional analysis of serum antibody to oral streptococcal antigens in children.
AB  == antibodies to s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mutans cells and to glucosyltransferases (gtf) prepared from these micro-organisms were measured in the sera of 133 infants and children by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). igg antibody activity to each cell type and gtp was present at birth (presumably derived from maternal transfer) and declined significantly thereafter. igg antibody levels to s. salivarius and s. sanguis were next detected in young children (2 to less than 3 yr group). however, an increase in igg antibody to s. mutans cells was not seen until children were older (4 to less than 8 yr group), possibly reflecting the later colonization of this organism. in contrast, igg antibody to gtf of all three streptococcal species remained at low  levels throughout the first four years of life. igg antibody to s. mutans gtf was then the first to appear (4 to less than 8 yr group). serum iga antibodies to all gtfs were not detected until after this time. fifteen sera were used to develop igg immunoblots with the gtf antigens. some positive sera (7/12) demonstrated reaction(s) with gtf from each of the three streptococcal species. individual sera showed igg antibody bonds to gtf from several serotypes of the mutans streptococci. no immunoblot reaction was observed with gtf and sera (3) from the  four-to-seven-year and younger age groups. these results indicate the presence of serum antibody to bacteria and bacterial products associated with plaque formation very early in life and during and after the pre-adolescent years. the potential exists for this serum antibody to modulate bacterial colonization or accumulation in the oral cavity.

TI  == effect of nutritional constraints on the biosynthesis of the components of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in a fresh isolate of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a procedure for the purification of enzyme i (ei) and the protein hpr, the general components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, from streptococcus mutans serotype c is presented. the method was also applied successfully to the purification of ei and hpr from streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus sanguis. using specific antibodies obtained against the proteins purified from s. mutans dr0001, we determined quantitatively by rocket electrophoresis the cellular levels of ei and hpr in a freshly isolated strain of s. mutans grown under various conditions in continuous culture. the activity of a few specific eiis was also determined by an in vitro phosphorylation test. results indicated that maximum eii activities for glucose,  mannose, and 2-deoxyglucose were obtained under conditions of glucose limitation, at ph 7.0 and low dilution rate (d = 0.057/h). increasing the amount of glucose or the dilution rate (d = 0.40/h) or decreasing the ph from 7.0 to 5.5 resulted in a 1.4- to 24-fold decrease in these activities. the eii activity for fructose  was not influenced by the growth conditions in the same way as the other eiis. the fructose eii was highest at ph 5.5 and at high dilution rate under conditions of glucose or nitrogen limitation and was always repressed at ph 7.0 and at low dilution rates. the intracellular levels of ei were also dependent on the growth  conditions. the highest concentration (0.65 nmol/mg of protein) was observed in cells grown under glucose limitation at ph 7.0 and high dilution rate, and the lowest concentration (0.12 nmol/mg of protein) was found in cells grown under glucose excess at ph 7.0 and high dilution rate. the other general component of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system, the protein hpr, was not influenced significantly by varying growth conditions.

TI  == degradation of starch and its hydrolytic products by oral bacteria.
AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  == six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and  benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics  were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with  the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by  streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus,  and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results  indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.

TI  == the bacteria responsible for ureolysis in artificial dental plaque.
AB  == the origin of ureolytic activity in artificial-mouth plaques was established by assessing the contribution to plaque ureolytic activity of the isolated bacteria. to overcome losses of ureolytic activity caused by the unstable presence of urease in oral bacteria, ureolytic bacteria were isolated from an exceptionally active plaque (1 mumol nh3/min per mg protein) in which 63 per cent of the flora  was ureolytic. after their ability to metabolize urea was stabilized, 13 ureolytic bacteria remained: seven strains of streptococcus salivarius, one streptococcus bovis, two staphylococcus epidermidis and three staphylococcus haemolyticus. their urease activity, measured after growth into stationary phase, was reproducible and strain specific with a 20-fold range within each genus. the  mean ureolytic activity of each species, when weighted by its calculated incidence in the original plaque, accounted for 40 per cent of the total plaque ureolytic activity. however, these values for urease levels were only a small fraction of the bacterial ureolytic potential. urease per mg cell protein measured during the growth cycle of a selected strep. salivarius, and staph. epidermidis, varied 10-fold, and reached much higher activities (i.e. 6-8 mumol nh3/min per mg of cell protein) than under the growth conditions that were used to assess the contribution of these species to total plaque ureolysis. thus urea  metabolism in artificial plaque was due mainly to strep. salivarius, with a small contribution from staph. epidermidis. the presence of further unidentified species of ureolytic oral bacteria need not be invoked.

TI  == the influence of incorporation of octadecenoic acid on the cell-associated fructosyltransferase and the extracellular glucosyltransferase activities of streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the rate of expression of the cell-associated fructosyltransferase (ftfm) activity of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 grown in continuous culture was linearly related to the rate of octadecenoic acid (c18:1) incorporation into the  membrane lipids irrespective of the presence or absence of tween 80 in the growth medium. this observation was confirmed with data obtained from cells grown in the presence of a series of n-alkanols. the results suggested that cosynthesis of lipids containing c18:1 residues was necessary for ftfm expression and accounted  for the slight stimulation of enzyme expression by tween 80 at all growth rates.  in contrast, addition of tween 80 to the growth medium resulted in several-fold increases in extracellular glucosyltransferase (gtfe) production irrespective of  the growth rate. following the addition of the surfactant to the growth medium, an exponential relation between the increased rate of gtfe production and the concomitant net increase in the rate of c18:1 incorporation was noted. the results obtained in continuous culture emphasized the underlying effect growth rate had on gtfe production, especially when tween 80 was added to the growth medium. in the presence of n-alkanols, the rate of gtfe production plotted as a single 'u'-shaped curve with respect to the rate of c18:1 incorporation irrespective of the chain length of the n-alkanol studied. rapid analyses of the  extracellular proteins by sds-page suggested that hexan-1-ol and tween 80 specifically stimulated the synthesis and secretion of gtfe and no other extracellular protein.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == fibrillar and fimbriate strains of streptococcus salivarius were compared for their ability to adhere to buccal epithelial cells and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads, and for their ability to coaggregate with veillonella strains. the fibrillar lancefield group k strains adhered statistically significantly better to both buccal epithelial cells and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads than the fimbriate strains, which lacked the lancefield group k antigen. after 1 h the fibrillar strains coaggregated statistically significantly better than the fimbriate strains with v. parvula strain v1, but after 24 h, coaggregation both of fibrillar and of fimbriate strains reached approximately 90%. freshly isolated veillonella strains all coaggregated with the s. salivarius strains, but the percentage coaggregation varied considerably after 1 h depending on the veillonella strain. coaggregation was independent of the presence of ca2+. s. salivarius strain hb-v5, a mutant of strain hb that had lost the veillonella-binding protein, coaggregated weakly with v. parvula strain v1, but coaggregated very well with other wild-type veillonellae, suggesting the presence of an alternative mechanism for veillonella-binding for strain hb. fibrillar strains were, therefore, more adhesive to oral surfaces and coaggregated with veillonellae after 1 h better than the fimbriate s. salivarius  strains. both fibrillar and fimbriate strains were highly hydrophobic in the hexadecane-buffer partition assay.

TI  == bacteriocin-like inhibitory activity associated with beta-hemolytic strains of streptococcus salivarius.

AB  == restriction enzyme fragments containing two sucrase genes have been isolated from a cosmid library of streptococcus salivarius dna. the genes were expressed in escherichia coli cells, and the properties of both enzymes were studied in partially purified protein extracts from e. coli. one gene encoding an invertase-type sucrase was subcloned on a 2.4-kilobase-pair fragment. the sucrase enzyme had a km for sucrose of 48 mm and a ph optimum of 6.5. the s. salivarius sucrase clone showed no detectable hybridization to a yeast invertase clone. two  overlapping subclones which had 1 kilobase pair of dna in common were used to localize a fructosyltransferase gene. the fructosyltransferase had a km of 93 mm  and a ph optimum of 7.0. the product of the fructosyltransferase was a levan. a fructosyltransferase clone from bacillus subtilis did not hybridize to s. salivarius dna. the properties of the enzymes were compared with those of previously characterized sucrases.

TI  == differential medium for mixed cultures of alpha-hemolytic streptococci from blood.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci (ahs) were isolated from blood cultures from 100 patients, and species were identified by the ruoff and kunz scheme. when isolates were inoculated onto sheep blood agar, all 100 cultures appeared to be pure, with identifications based on colonial morphology and gram stain. when isolates were subcultured onto mitis salivarius agar (msa), mixtures of two species of ahs were detected in 10 cultures from patients (10%). these mixed cultures would have been reported as pure cultures of streptococcus milleri (six cultures), streptococcus  salivarius (three cultures), streptococcus sanguis i (one culture), with identifications based on biochemical profiles. cultures on msa demonstrated s. milleri (six cultures), streptococcus mitis (five cultures), s. salivarius (three cultures), s. sanguis i (one culture), and s. sanguis ii (five cultures). the inability to separate ahs species by colony morphology on sheep blood agar demands that a differential medium such as msa be routinely used for subculture.  failure to use such a medium may account for some of the confusing biochemical profiles associated with ahs species identification.

TI  == adaptation of the membrane fatty acid composition by growth in the presence of n-alkanols influences glycosyltransferase expression in streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == growth of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 in the presence of n-alkanols in the series methanol to decan-1-ol led to a decrease in the unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio. each member of the set of n-alkanols which was examined over a range of concentrations possessed a point at which extracellular  glucosyltransferase (gtf) production was minimal; increasing the concentration of the n-alkanol past this point stimulated gtf production. this effect was greatest with hexan-1-ol although it was observed to a lesser extent with pentan-1-ol and  heptan-1-ol. reduced cell-associated fructosyltransferase activity was observed with increasing concentrations of each n-alkanol. growth in the presence of 25 mm-propan-1-ol gave rise to a fatty acid profile in which 55% of the fatty acids  were of an odd chain length. s. salivarius atcc 25975 was shown to be able to utilize ethanol in a similar manner to propan-1-ol by growing it in the presence  of 400 mm-[14c]ethanol. analysis of the membrane lipids at the stationary phase of growth indicated that 17.6% of the carbon of the fatty acids was derived from  ethanol. a leaky adh mutant, s. salivarius mj 37501, was isolated. the leaky nature of the mutant enabled it to incorporate reduced levels of odd-chain-length fatty acids into its membrane lipids when grown in the presence of 100 mm-propan-1-ol, but not when grown in the presence of 25 mm-propan-1-ol. s. salivarius atcc 25975 therefore metabolized propan-1-ol (and ethanol) via a constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase.

TI  == the effect of sucrose on the colonization of acrylic by candida albicans in pure  and mixed culture in an artificial mouth.
AB  == the roles of sucrose and microbial interactions in the colonization of acrylic by candida albicans in an artificial mouth were investigated. the acrylic was colonized by pure cultures of the organism but a visible plaque was not produced  whether or not sucrose was present. salivary bacteria had no effect in the absence of sucrose but when sucrose was present the numbers of c. albicans were significantly increased. it is suggested that this phenomenon is related to the production of extracellular polysaccharides by salivary streptococci in the presence of sucrose. in mixed culture of c. albicans and streptococcus salivarius cj2, growth of the latter was inhibited in the presence of sucrose. this inhibition was due to factors other than ph, although no such antagonism could be demonstrated on solid media.

TI  == metabolism of glycosylsucrose by oral microorganisms and its hydrolysis by streptococcus salivarius fructosyltransferase.
AB  == resting-cell suspensions of oral microorganisms grown in sucrose were studied for the production of acid from glucosylsucrose and maltosylsucrose. most oral microorganisms fermented these sugars to only a limited extent. streptococcus salivarius, however, metabolized glucosylsucrose as well as sucrose. we therefore looked for a specific enzyme in s. salivarius which was capable of hydrolyzing glucosylsucrose. fructosyltransferase and invertase were purified from s. salivarius 13419, and the substrate specificities and hydrolytic activities of these enzymes were determined. purified fructosyltransferase catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose, whereas purified invertase barely hydrolyzed these sugars. these results suggest that the high fermentative  efficiency of glycosylsucrose by s. salivarius is due to the hydrolysis of these  sugars by fructosyltransferase, but not by invertase. the partially purified fructosyltransferases of actinomyces viscosus ny1 and streptococcus mutans ncib 11723 catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose. the fructosyltransferases of these oral microorganisms are also responsible for the hydrolysis of glycosylsucrose.

TI  == relationship of cell surface morphology and composition of streptococcus salivarius k+ to adherence and hydrophobicity.
AB  == the cell surfaces of a range of variants of streptococcus salivarius hb, altered  in cell wall antigen composition, were compared with those of the parent with respect to adherence, ability to adsorb to hexadecane, morphology, and exposure of lipoteichoic acid (lta). adherence to host surfaces was measured by using both saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and tissue-cultured hela cells, and interbacterial adherence was measured by using veillonella alcalescens v1 cells.  progressive loss of the protease-sensitive fibril classes was generally associated with decreasing ability to adsorb to hexadecane. however, increased exposure of protein antigen c (agc) increased the apparent hydrophobicity of the  cell. this correlated with the finding that agc was the most hydrophobic of the solubilized fibrillar cell wall antigens. collectively, this demonstrates that adsorption to hydrophobic ligands is directly related to the density of the fibrillar layer on the cells and the properties and surface exposure of specific  fibril classes. the involvement of hydrophobic interactions in agc-associated attachment was suggested by its sensitivity to low levels of the hydrophobic bond-breaking agent tetramethyl urea, although the reduction was not to the level of adherence observed with strains lacking agc. however, hydrophobicity was less  essential to other adherence reactions. circumstantial evidence, including immunoelectron microscopy, showing that lta was virtually absent from the fibrillar layer, whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, suggesting that surface exposure of lta related inversely to the density of the fibrillar layer,  and agarose gel electrophoresis, showing that lta was not specifically associated with protein fibrillar antigens, strongly suggested that lta does not confer hydrophobic properties to these cells and is not involved in adherence reactions  associated with the cell wall protein antigens.

TI  == the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system of streptococcus salivarius. identification of a iiiman protein.
AB  == a double-spontaneous mutant resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of alpha-methylglucoside and 2-deoxyglucose was isolated from streptococcus salivarius. this mutant strain, called alpha s3l11, did not grow on mannose and grew poorly on 5 mm fructose and 5 mm glucose. isolated membranes of strain alpha s3l11 were unable to catalyse the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of mannose in the presence of purified enzyme i and hpr. addition of dialysed membrane-free cellular extract of the wild-type strain to the reaction medium restored the activity. the factor that restored the phosphoenolpyruvate-mannose phosphotransferase activity to membranes of strain alpha s3l11 was called iiiman. this factor was partially purified from the wild-type strain by deae-cellulose chromatography, deae-tsk chromatography, and molecular seiving on a column of ultrogel aca 34. this partially purified preparation also enhanced the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose in strain alpha s3l11.

TI  == a simple method for determining extracellular polysaccharide-producing ability of oral streptococci.
AB  == a simple method is described for determining the types of extracellular polysaccharides produced by oral streptococci. the method yields quantitative results in which the amount of polysaccharides produced is normalised with respect to dna. results correlate well with previously published data for oral streptococci, except in the case of streptococcus oralis for which there is no previously published data. all species within the mutans group produced both soluble and insoluble glucan; while soluble fructan was only produced by strains  of streptococcus rattus and streptococcus mutans. the major extracellular polysaccharide produced by streptococcus salivarius was soluble fructan, although some strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. most streptococcus sanguis strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. soluble fructan was produced by some strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis. the latter also produced soluble and insoluble glucan. no detectable extracellular polysaccharide was elaborated by streptococcus milleri, streptococcus faecalis or streptococcus lactis.

AB  == a simple dip-slide test (cariescreen sm) based on msb selective agar was devised  for detection and quantitation of streptococcus mutans in oral samples. for this  test, a bacitracin tablet is dissolved in a vial containing buffered saline diluent. paraffin-stimulated saliva is collected in this diluent vial. a dip slide which incorporates a modified msb agar (minus bacitracin) is immersed briefly in the diluted saliva. after addition of a co2-generating tablet, the screw-cap dip slide is closed tightly in the vial and incubated for two days at 37 degrees c and one day at room temperature. s. mutans populations in saliva are estimated by comparison with a colony density chart. growth of reference strains  of s. mutans was equivalent on cariescreen sm dip slides and on msb agar plates.  reference strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus milleri did not grow on cariescreen sm dip slides. aliquots of saliva from 50 schoolchildren and 51 adults were tested by the dip-slide method and by conventional plating methods in msb agar. very good correlation (0.93) between the two methods was obtained. this simplified s. mutans detection system is suitable for use by clinical personnel in dental clinics or other non-laboratory settings for identification of subjects potentially at risk for caries.

AB  == a cell-associated fructosyltransferase produced by streptococcus salivarius was irreversibly inactivated in a time-dependent manner when resting or permeabilized cell suspensions were incubated with low concentrations (less than 1.0 microm) of copper. in addition to copper, the inactivation was dependent on oxygen and on a  fermentable carbon source (endogenous intracellular polysaccharide or glucose). in starved, permeabilized cell suspensions, the fermentable carbon source could be replaced by nadh but not by nadph or atp. of several other s. salivarius enzymes tested, only fructosyltransferase was inactivated under these conditions. the available evidence indicated that nadh oxidase is the enzyme responsible for  fructosyltransferase inactivation. results from oxygen radical scavenger studies  implicated one or more species of oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide in the inactivation reaction.

AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

AB  == phosphoproteins which arise from incubation of streptococcus salivarius atcc25975 crude extracts with [32p]phosphoenolpyruvate and [gamma-32p]atp, were separated and detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. these procedures were carried out using the methodology that has been developed to allow for the detection of phosphoproteins containing 1-p-histidinyl and 3-p-histidinyl residues, and also to distinguish between these and phosphoproteins containing acid-stable phosphoamino acids such as phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. extracts of cells which had been grown with various sugars as carbon sources were investigated to determine both constitutive and inducible phosphoproteins. no evidence was found for phosphoproteins specifically induced by a sugar, and in particular no evidence was found for any iiisugar phosphocarrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts). incubation with [gamma-32p]atp showed that histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (hpr) of the pts could be phosphorylated to give both acid-stable and acid-labile phosphoamino acid residues. the acid-labile atp-dependent phosphorylation activity was activated by glucose-6-p and appeared to produce a 3-p-histidinyl residue in hpr.

TI  == structural properties of fibrillar proteins isolated from the cell surface and cytoplasm of streptococcus salivarius (k+) cells and nonadhesive mutants.
AB  == most streptococcus salivarius (k+) cells contain two protein antigens with different adhesive functions. the subcellular distribution and some structural properties of purified proteins were studied. antigen b (agb), a protein involved in interbacterial coaggregation with gram-negative bacteria, was present in the cell wall fraction only of the wild-type strain and was absent from the cells of  a nonadhesive mutant. antigen c (agc), a glycoprotein involved in host-associated adhesive functions, was predominantly associated with the cell wall of the wild-type strain (agcw), but accumulated in high amounts in the cytoplasmic fraction (agcin) of mutants lacking the wall-associated form. agb, agcw, and agcin had molecular weights of 380,000, 250,000 to 320,000, and 488,000, respectively, upon gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol the molecular weights were only slightly lower, suggesting that the free, isolated molecules exist as monomers under native conditions. agcin readily stained with periodate-schiff reagent, indicating a significant content of carbohydrate, similar to agcw. circular dichroism spectra showed that about 45% of the amino acids of agcw were  involved in alpha-helical coiled structures. agb had a significantly lower proportion of ordered coiled structure. electron microscopic observations of low-angle-shadowed preparations of purified antigens showed that they were flexible, thin rods with thickened or globular ends. measurements corrected for shadow thickness showed lengths of 184 nm (agb), 112 nm (agcin), and 87 nm (agcw). treatment of agcw with protease destroyed the fibrillar core, but seemed  not to affect the globular ends. comparison of the results with the localization  of the antigens in wild-type and specific mutant strains suggested that each antigen molecule may represent a single, characteristic surface fibril with a specific adhesive capacity.

TI  == negative staining and immunoelectron microscopy of adhesion-deficient mutants of  streptococcus salivarius reveal that the adhesive protein antigens are separate classes of cell surface fibril.
AB  == the subcellular distribution of the cell wall-associated protein antigens of streptococcus salivarius hb, which are involved in specific adhesive properties of the cells, was studied. mutants which had lost the adhesive properties and lacked the antigens at the cell surface were compared with the parent strain. immunoelectron microscopy of cryosections of cells labeled with affinity-purified, specific antisera and colloidal gold-protein a complexes was used to locate the antigens. antigen c (agc), a glycoprotein involved in attachment to host surfaces, was mainly located in the fibrillar layer outside the cell wall. a smaller amount of label was also found throughout the cytoplasmic area in the form of small clusters of gold particles, which suggests  a macromolecular association. mutant hb-7, which lacks the wall-associated agc, accumulated agc reactivity intracellularly. intracellular agc was often found associated with isolated areas of increased electron density, but sometimes seemed to fill the entire interior of the cell. antigen b (agb), a protein responsible for interbacterial coaggregation, was also located in the fibrillar layer, although its distribution differed from that of the wall-associated agc since agb was found predominantly in the peripheral areas. a very small amount of label was also found in the cytoplasmic area as discrete gold particles. mutant hb-v5, which lacks wall-associated agb, was not labeled in the fibrillar coat, but showed the same weak intracellular label as the parent strain. immunolabeling with serum against agd, another wall-associated protein but of unknown function,  demonstrated its presence in the fibrillar layer of strain hb. negatively stained preparations of whole cells of wild-type s. salivarius and mutants that had lost  wall-associated agb or agc revealed that two classes of short fibrils are carried on the cell surface at the same time. agb and agc are probably located on separate classes of short, protease-sensitive fibrils 91 and 72 nm in length, respectively. a third class of only very sparsely distributed short fibrils (63 nm) was observed on mutant hb-v51, which lacks both wall-associated agb and agc antigens. the identity of these fibrils and whether they are present on the wild  type are not clear. the function of long, protease-resistant fibrils of 178 nm, which are also present on the wild-type strain, remains unknown.

TI  == streptococci and activities of sucrases and alpha-amylases in supragingival dental plaque and saliva in three caries activity groups.
AB  == thirty-eight young adults participated in the study. they were divided in a caries-inactive group, a low caries activity group and a moderate to high caries  activity group. total cultivable bacteria, streptococcus salivarius, and s. mutans in plaque and saliva were quantitated on tsa, ms, and msb plates, respectively. sucrase activity was determined by measuring reducing sugars in plaque and saliva after incubation with sucrose. alpha-amylase activity was determined by pharmacia phadebas amylase test. the data were analyzed with the non-parametric mann-whitney u test. the only significant difference was observed  for plaque alpha-amylase activity between the caries-inactive group and the moderate-high caries activity group (p less than 0.05). the lack of differences concerning the other variables is discussed mainly on the basis of the multifactorial character of dental caries and the possible insufficiency of the applied methods.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a 60-kilodalton salivary glycoprotein with agglutinating activity against strains of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a bacterial agglutinin specific for strains of streptococcus mutans was isolated  from human saliva. physiochemical analyses showed the agglutinin to be a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000. the agglutinin aggregated four of the eight strains of streptococcus mutans tested but did not aggregate the strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis tested. chemical modification of carbohydrate moieties of the agglutinin with sodium metaperiodate had no effect on aggregation, whereas modification of the polypeptide portion with trypsin abolished aggregating activity. a set of five murine hybridoma antibodies was employed to further analyze the agglutinin.  two carbohydrate-specific antibodies, directed against d-mannose and n-acetylgalactosamine moieties, respectively, failed to block agglutinin- or whole saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. in contrast, two antibodies directed against pronase-sensitive antigenic sites blocked both agglutinin- and saliva-mediated aggregation of s. mutans cells. western blot analysis with the agglutinin-specific hybridoma antibodies demonstrated the agglutinin in whole saliva and in artificial tooth pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite beads incubated with saliva. these results suggest that a 60-kilodalton glycoprotein of human saliva is a bacterial agglutinin with specificity for certain strains of s. mutans. they further suggest that aggregation is mediated by polypeptide rather than carbohydrate determinants of the glycoprotein.

AB  == the adhesion to fibrin-platelet clots in vitro of 21 strains of streptococci isolated from the blood of patients with sub-acute bacterial endocarditis (sabe)  was measured. the species, in order of greatest adhesion, were streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus milleri, streptococcus sanguis, dextran-positive streptococcus mitior, dextran-negative streptococcus mitior and  streptococcus salivarius. individual strains within species, however, cannot be assumed to be representative of their species and may exhibit unusually high or low adhesion. adhesion depended upon both bacterial concentration and period of contact. there was no simple relationship between ability to adhere and liability to cause endocarditis. formation of dextran did not increase adhesion. the streptococci were more adhesive than strains of escherichia coli and neisseria sicca and less adhesive than strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.

TI  == microbiological and microhardness evaluation of artificial enamel fissures worn intraorally by humans.
AB  == devices simulating occlusal fissures were constructed from dental enamel and bonded to human maxillary molar teeth for 3 weeks. facilitation of in vivo caries research in humans is the long-range goal for this model system. in the present investigation, microbial compositions of plaque in the fissural space of the model and natural fissural plaque from teeth bearing the devices were compared. plaque from models constructed from either bovine or human enamel was also compared. in addition, microhardness of the enamel surfaces was examined before and after oral exposure. plaque in both bovine and human enamel models differed significantly from natural fissural plaque in several microbial categories. differences appeared to be related to the increased accessibility of the deep fissural contents of the models. for example, levels of the aciduric streptococcus mutans and veillonella species were higher in the models, although  levels of a salivary inhabitant, streptococcus salivarius, were lower. plaque in  bovine and human enamel models was similar, and both models showed significant decreases in enamel microhardness after oral exposure for 3 weeks. the model system should be useful in caries research in that carieslike activity was simulated within a relatively short period of time, and the fissural space became colonized by high levels of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

AB  == the n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitive exchange of 2h+ of a cell for k+ of medium stable to ph, k+ activity and temperature changes has been discovered in anaerobically grown gram-negative escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium. s. enteritidis, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus salivarius, l. lactis in the presence of exogenic energy source. this exchange in gram-negative bacteria is operating only at increase of medium osmolarity. the high k+ distribution between cell and medium has been reached during the exchange of 2h+ for one k+ and the corresponding potassium equilibrium potential is much more than the measured delta psi. in aerobically grown e. coli, s. typhimurium, brevibacterium flavum and aerobic micrococcus luteus exchange of 2h+ for k+ does not take place, the k+ distribution is lower and in good conformity with the measured delta psi. it is assumed that exchange of 2h+ for k+ in anaerobic bacteria is carried out by the h+-atpase complex and the trk (or trk-like) system of k+ absorption united into the same membrane supercomplex which functions as the h+-k+-pump and supports the high k+ distribution between cell and medium.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of streptococcus mutans: purification of hpr and enzyme i and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  == enzyme i and hpr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. to determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme i and hpr from s. mutans atcc 27352. using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we  determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme i and hpr in cells of s. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of s. mutans. hpr was purified by  the procedure reported by gauthier et al. (l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

TI  == inhibition of the expression of cell-associated fructosyltransferase in streptococcus salivarius by octyl beta-d-glucopyranoside.
AB  == octyl beta-d-glucopyranoside prevented the expression of cell-associated fructosyltransferase activity in streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 grown in batch culture or incubated in nonproliferating cell suspension medium. this effect was not due to the direct inhibition of enzyme activity nor due to the loss of active enzyme into the external medium. the prevention of enzyme expression did not appear to be due to the inhibition of a general translocation  mechanism for protein secretion, since fructosyltransferase activity was not detected within the cytoplasm of lysed cells grown in the presence of octyl beta-d-glucopyranoside; nor was there any observed inhibition of the secretion of the extracellular enzyme glucosyltransferase. these and other observations supported the view that fructosyltransferase was not secreted across the cytoplasmic membrane in an active form before becoming associated with the cell surface.

TI  == fluoride uptake and fluoride resistance in oral streptococci.
AB  == fluoride uptake was examined in the highly f-sensitive streptococcus salivarius strain 25975, the f-resistant mutant flr103, and the relatively insensitive s. sanguis h7pr3. f was taken up by all strains from media at neutral ph, containing 1 or 10 micrograms f/ml (0.053-0.526 mmol/l), and uptake was directly proportional to the delta ph that was maintained by the cells. the final intracellular concentrations of f in the f-resistant strains were higher than those in the f-sensitive strain. similar differences in f uptake were observed in buffer at ph 5.5, although both delta ph and f uptake were higher in all strains  at the lower ph. these experiments demonstrate that resistance to f does not necessarily involve the exclusion of f from the cells. the lower uptake of f by f-sensitive cells is attributed to the finding that f dissipates the transmembrane ph gradient, and this, in turn, limits the concentration of intracellular f.

TI  == streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus detection in the assessment of dental root surface caries risk.
AB  == forty-five subjects contributing 150 root surfaces with gingival recession were sampled seven times over a 32-month period. we calculated isolation frequencies of lactobacilli on selective rogosa sl agar and s. mutans in a sensitive enrichment broth and on mitis salivarius agar. both s. mutans and lactobacilli were isolated more frequently from surfaces which became carious than from those  remaining caries-free. isolation frequencies were also higher for caries-free surfaces in caries-active subjects than for caries-free surfaces in caries-inactive subjects. the presence or absence of s. mutans and lactobacilli in samples taken at baseline could discriminate between subjects who were to be root-caries-active and those who were to remain root-caries-inactive during the subsequent observation period. moreover, if both bacteria were detected or only s. mutans was detected on a root surface at its entry into the study, that surface had a greater risk for developing a root lesion. however, the tests could not predict which root surfaces within the mouths of caries-active subjects were  to become carious. analysis of the data suggests that simple microbiological detection tests may be useful in identifying patients at high risk of root caries.

AB  == contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. at least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. the species streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg x cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). s. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg x cm-2; p less than 0.002). the species s. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta f adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma  s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg x cm-2. however, s. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to  surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. the results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.

AB  == the ability of streptococcus salivarius strain tove-r to inhibit the ecological emergence of virulent representatives of the most prevalent human mutans streptococci on the teeth of specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats was studied. rats which were infected by tove-r, or either s. mutans 10449s or s. sobrinus 6715-13wt, or uninfected were transiently co-caged so as to allow natural fecal transfer of organisms due to coprophagy. the infectants were differentially recovered from swabs of the teeth over the time course of the experiments and from sonified teeth at termination. data were expressed on both relative (percentage) and absolute (cfu) bases. initial oral colonization of rats by tove-r inhibited the ecological emergence of fecally transmitted s. mutans 10449s and s. sobrinus 6715-13wt. there was a generally inverse relationship between the percentages and absolute numbers of tove-r and the mutans streptococci on the teeth, which strongly suggested their competition for tooth sites. absolute numbers of total recoverable flora from the teeth upon sonification were correlated with caries scores, thus suggesting that total recoverable flora counts substantially reflect cavitation status. tove-r itself induced no apparent caries activity and its transmission to rats already infected by 10449s or its colonization of rats before 10449s infection inhibition caries induction by this s. mutans strain; similar anticaries effects were not statistically significant for tove-r against 6715-13wt in these experiments. these data on the inhibition of the ecological emergence of the mutans streptococci supplement the already reported ability of tove-r to preempt initial colonization of teeth and partially displace the colonization of teeth by the mutans streptococci.

AB  == the ability of streptococcus salivarius tove-r to displace virulent representatives of the most prevalent human mutans streptococci from the teeth of rats, and thereby to inhibit caries, was studied. streptococcus mutans 10449s- or streptococcus sobrinus 6715-13wt-infected specific-pathogen-free rats consuming a high-sucrose diet were inoculated by tove-r. the infectants were differentially recovered from swabs of the teeth over the time course of infection and from sonically treated material of extracted teeth and excised tongues. despite initial colonization of the teeth by the mutans streptococci, tove-r colonized the teeth, unlike other essentially nonvirulent plaque formers already described. it did not colonize the tongues of the rats. tove-r emerged and persisted as a prominent member of the plaque ecology. there was an associated decline in the mutans streptococci on the teeth, and this decline was associated with significant inhibition of the caries component attributable to 10449s infection (56%) and to 6715-13wt infection (52%). tove-r did not reliably inhibit the component of fissure caries attributable to the nonmutans indigenous flora of the rats. tove-r itself induced no detectable decay. the data suggest the potential therapeutic utility of tove-r to inhibit caries by displacement of mutans streptococci from the teeth. these results supplement the already reported ability of tove-r to preempt initial colonization of teeth by the mutans streptococci.

TI  == dissipation of the proton motive force in oral streptococci by fluoride.
AB  == strains of oral streptococci maintain an intracellular ph (phi) that is more alkaline than the external ph (pho). the delta ph (phi-pho) was about 0.6 in neutral media and about 0.9 in media of ph 5.5. addition of 10 micrograms of f- per ml at ph 7.0 reduced the delta ph in streptococcus salivarius to 0.17. the reduction of delta ph in s. sanguis h7pr3 was less pronounced, whereas the delta  ph in s. mutans ib 1600 was unaffected. the f- -resistant mutant of s. salivarius, strain flr103, maintained a delta ph of 0.51 with 100 micrograms of f- per ml. addition of f- to cells in media below ph 6.0 led to a reduction of delta ph in all strains. the anion had no effect on the transmembrane electrical  gradient of either mutant or parental cells of s. salivarius at ph 7.0. the principal effect of f- addition at neutral ph, therefore, was on the delta ph component of the proton motive force. at ph 5.5, 100 micrograms of f- per ml reduced the transmembrane electrical gradient from 71 to 40 mv in the parent and  from 80 to 42 mv in the mutant. we propose that the greater sensitivity of cells  to f- at lower medium ph stems from the rapid dissipation of delta ph by the anion. thus, ph equilibration in media of low ph would lead to a greater reduction of metabolic activity than when it occurs in media at neutral ph. the data also suggest that the growth of streptococci, with or without added f-, is limited when the intracellular ph falls below about 5.7.

TI  == ph change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

TI  == enhanced secretion of glucosyltransferase by changes in potassium ion concentrations is accompanied by an altered pattern of membrane fatty acids in streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == growth of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 in a na+-based medium containing 1  to 50 mm k+ enhanced extracellular glucosyltransferase production by 3.7-fold over the level of enzyme found in a k+-based medium containing 184 mm k+. enzyme  synthesis and secretion were further enhanced in a nonlinear manner with respect  to the concentration of k+ in the medium when cells were cultured from an inoculum grown in the presence of 1 mm k+. this concentration of k+ was the minimum required to maintain a near-maximum growth rate for s. salivarius in medium where k+ was limited. a maximum sevenfold stimulation of glucosyltransferase production occurred at 18 mm k+ under these conditions. analysis of the total membrane lipids showed that the composition of octadecanoic acid increased with decreasing k+ concentration essentially at the expense of the octadecenoic acid moiety. extracellular glucosyltransferase production was found  to be directly related to the ratio of these two fatty acids. similar confirmatory results over a greater range of enzyme production were obtained with nonproliferating cell suspensions.

AB  == the acidurance of glycolysis by intact cells of streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus salivarius atcc 25925, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 was found to be highly dependent on membrane functions affected by gramicidin, which  increases the proton permeability of cell membranes. plots of % glucose utilized  during two hours against suspension ph values for cells suspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer plus 1 mm mgcl2 plus 13.9 mm glucose indicated, for 50% glucose  utilization, ph values of 5.0 for s. mutans, 5.7 for s. salivarius, and 6.2 for s. sanguis. gramicidin treatment shifted these values to 6.0, 6.3, and 6.9, respectively. growth of s. mutans and s. salivarius in complex media proved to be more acid-sensitive than was glycolysis, and in batch cultures, there was a well-defined, post-growth phase of glycolysis. minimum ph values for growth and for glycolysis in medium with excess glucose were approximately 4.8 and 4.4, respectively, for s. mutans, and 4.9 and 4.3 for s. salivarius. s. sanguis was less aciduric and showed little differential acid sensitivity, with minimum ph values of about 5.2 for both growth and glycolysis. fluoride acted to eliminate the differences in acidurance of growth and glycolysis for s. mutans or s. salivarius and to render both processes more acid-sensitive. thus, glycolysis was more fluoride-sensitive than was growth. growth was found to be acid-limited in media with initial glucose levels greater than 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5% (weight/volume) for s. sanguis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius, respectively, and to be glucose-limited at lower levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of exopolysaccharide production by viridans streptococci on penicillin therapy of experimental endocarditis.
AB  == the influence of exopolysaccharide production by viridans streptococci on penicillin therapy of endocarditis was studied in rabbits with experimental aortic-valve endocarditis. animals were first infected with penicillin-susceptible streptococci known to produce varying amounts of exopolysaccharide in cardiac vegetations. treatment with procaine penicillin, 300,000 u every 12 hr, was begun one to two days after infection. after five days of therapy, animals infected with streptococcus sanguis ii and streptococcus morbillorum, both vigorous exopolysaccharide producers, continued to have infected vegetations, while animals infected with streptococcus salivarius and a  different streptococcus sanguis ii, both deficient in exopolysaccharide production, had sterile vegetations. these findings indicate that failure to eradicate streptococci from vegetations correlates with exopolysaccharide production and that this property may be important in determining outcome of therapy.

TI  == purification and preliminary characterization of exo-beta-d-fructosidase in streptococcus salivarius kta-19.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius fructosidase (beta-d-fructan fructohydrolase, ec 3.2.1.80) was purified to homogeneity. the molecular weight of the fructosidase was estimated to be 83,000 to 85,000 by gel filtration and by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the ph optimum of the enzyme was 7.0, and the isoelectric point was ph 4.7. the purified enzyme preparation hydrolyzed  levan, inulin, and several 2-beta-linkage-containing oligosaccharides such as sucrose and raffinose, but not melezitose, dextran, and pseudonigeran. the fructosidase was inhibited by fe3+, cu2+, hg2+, and ag+, but not by ca2+, co2+, mg2+, and zn2+, at a concentration of 10(-3) m. mn2+ was particularly effective in stimulating activity at the same concentration. the presence of either edta or kcn also increased fructosidase activity by 20 to 30%. the enzyme was susceptible to sulfhydryl reagents since p-chloromercuribenzoate (10(-7) m) produced 63% inhibition of the activity. however, this inhibition was overcome in the presence of cysteine. this enzyme acts as an exofructosidase since thin-layer chromatographic analysis revealed that d-fructose was formed from levan or inulin by the action of the enzyme.

TI  == does an increase in membrane unsaturated fatty acids account for tween 80 stimulation of glucosyltransferase secretion by streptococcus salivarius?
AB  == when streptococcus salivarius was grown in batch culture in the presence of various tween detergents, the fatty acid moiety of the detergent was incorporated into the lipids of its membrane. tween 80 (containing primarily oleic acid) markedly stimulated the production of extracellular glucosyltransferase and also  increased the degree of unsaturation of the membrane lipid fatty acids. the possibility that an increase in membrane unsaturated fatty acids promoted extracellular glucosyltransferase production was examined by growing cells at different temperatures in the presence or absence of tween 80. the membrane lipids of cells grown at 30 degrees c, 37 degrees c and 40 degrees c without tween 80 exhibited unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratios of 2.06, 1.01 and 0.87 respectively. a significant increase in the production of extracellular glucosyltransferase was observed at 30 degrees c compared to cells grown at 40 degrees c. however, cells produced much more exoenzyme at all temperatures when grown with tween 80. the results indicated that an increase in the unsaturated fatty acid content of the membrane lipids was not by itself sufficient to account for the stimulation of extracellular glucosyltransferase production by tween 80,  but that the surfactant also had to be present.

TI  == isolation of a novel protein involved in the transport of fructose by an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase system in streptococcus mutans.
AB  == fructose transport in streptococcus mutans lg-1 is mediated by at least two distinct phosphoenolpyruvate fructose phosphotransferase systems. one system is constitutive and consists of membrane components enzyme ii as well as enzyme i and heat-stable protein. the other system is inducible and requires, in addition  to enzyme i and heat-stable protein, a soluble substrate-specific protein for catalytic activity. this protein factor, designated iiifru, was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, molecular sieving  on sephadex g-75, and preparative electrophoresis. the purified preparation showed only one protein band, with a molecular weight of 12,600, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, on gel electrophoresis with the discontinuous buffer tris-glycine, and after electrofocusing in gel (pi  congruent to 3.7). the molecular weight of the native protein determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 51,000. immunodiffusion experiments performed with  immunoglobulins prepared against the purified iiifru from s. mutans lg-1 suggested that other s. mutans strains possessed a iiifru. no precipitin bands, however, were detected with extracts from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. lactis, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli.

TI  == viridans streptococci in infective endocarditis: species distribution and susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar, an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar for enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an agar medium for selective recovery and enumeration of streptococcus mutans was developed as an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar. combinations of dyes, antibiotics, and tellurite were added to a nonselective medium which, because of its sucrose content, allowed easy recognition of s. mutans colonies. candle jar incubation for 2 days, by comparison with anaerobic incubation, reduced background flora but did not diminish s. mutans recoveries from clinical samples. quantitative comparisons were made of the simultaneous recoveries of a number of authentic s. mutans serotype representatives and fresh  clinical isolates, using various glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) formulations and mitis salivarius, msb, and blood agars. mitis salivarius  counts were not detectably different from blood counts, but counts on msb were distinctly lower. a formulation of the new medium containing 5% glucose 5% sucrose, 0.001% potassium tellurite, 0.3 u of bacitracin per ml (hence gstb), and 2% agar gave recoveries nearly equal to those on mitis salivarius agar and much greater than those on msb. the medium yielded readily recognized s. mutans colonies and facilitated detection of intracellular polysaccharide formers upon flooding with i2 reagent. freshly isolated serotype c, e, and f colonies could often be distinguished from serotype d and g colonies, a distinction made reliable by testing for intracellular polysaccharide. a study of 300 salivary samples revealed gstb to give significantly higher recoveries than msb. about 72% of all samples were substantially underestimated for s. mutans with msb, and 6.7% of samples were falsely negative for s. mutans with msb. recovery of background flora on gstb was as low or lower than on msb, and both types of agar could be stored for at least 9 weeks without notable change of selectivity. thus, gstb agar appears to be simple and reliable to use and requires no anaerobic incubation. caution is voiced about interpretation of data previously reported which evaluated s. mutans on msb agar.

AB  == a dna sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans designated u202 (j. a. tobian and f. l. macrina, j. bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). we used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. eleven strains (including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, and s. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by southern blot analysis. seven strains showed strong hybridization to the tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetm class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. one of the clinical s. sanguis i isolates studied was able to transfer its tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid dna. this transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to dnase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. using the cloned tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon tn916 in its behavior.

TI  == reaction of human colostral and early milk antibodies with oral streptococci.
AB  == colostrum or early breast milk or both from each of 16 healthy women contained agglutinating antibodies for all normal streptococcal inhabitants of the human oral cavity (s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. salivarius), including those which colonize the neonatal oral cavity in significant numbers. agglutination correlated with the amount of immunoglobulin a (iga) binding to bacterial surfaces as measured by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin hemagglutination. surprisingly, colostral iga agglutinated our control organism, brucella abortus.  low levels of colostral or milk igm and igg antibodies also reacted with all of the test bacteria. absorption studies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that a proportion of antibodies in colostrum and early milk is specific for each of the different oral streptococci. fractionation on sepharose 4b indicated that 11s secretory iga is the predominant form of colostral and milk antibody for all of the test bacteria, including b. abortus. no evidence was found that reactions other than antigen-antibody reactions resulted in binding of colostral immunoglobulins by any of the test bacteria.

TI  == clinical isolates of streptococcus mutans serotype c with altered colony morphology due to fructan synthesis.
AB  == streptococcus mutans mt6801 , mt6861 , and mt6879 , which form large mucoid colonies on mitis salivarius agar, were isolated from a mother and her two daughters. these isolates were identified as serotype c by immunodiffusion with serotype-specific antisera. the large colonies formed on sucrose-containing agar  were found to contain water-soluble fructan . the cell-free fructosyltransferase  ( ftase ) activity of the strains which formed large colonies was five to eight times higher than that of serotype c s. mutans which produced small, rough colonies typical of this serotype. furthermore, greater quantities of fructan were synthesized from sucrose by growing cells of mt6801 when compared with mt8148 , a typical serotype c s. mutans. glucosyltransferase and ftase could be isolated by chromatofocusing from culture supernatants of mt6801 and mt8148 . the ftase activity of both strains was eluted at ph 4.5, and glucosyltransferase was  released by elution with an nacl linear gradient. the eluted ftase activity of mt6801 was significantly higher than that of mt8148 . strains mt6861 and mt6879 were also found to possess a similar property in terms of ftase activity. these results suggest that formation of large mucoid colonies by these strains is a consequence of high ftase activity.

TI  == impact of phenoxymethylpenicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin and doxycycline on streptococcus salivarius in the oropharynx.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius plays a role in the normal oropharyngeal resistance to colonization with group a streptococci. suppression of str. salivarius may increase the risk of colonization. ten subjects were given phenoxymethylpenicillin, ten were given erythromycin, ten were given clindamycin  and ten were given doxycycline for seven days. the numbers of str. salivarius in  the oral cavity were determined before, during and after the administration periods. phenoxymethylpenicillin and doxycycline only slightly suppressed the numbers of str. salivarius, while erythromycin and clindamycin markedly decreased the numbers. in four and five subjects respectively, str. salivarius could no longer be isolated after seven days of the drug administration.

TI  == structure and properties of the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci.
AB  == the presence of three distinct enzymes ii that catalysed the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, fructose, and mannose was established in membranes of glucose-grown cells of streptococcus salivarius 25975 and various strains of streptococcus mutans. the enzyme ii mannose phosphorylated mainly mannose, glucose, and 2-deoxyglucose, and the enzyme ii glucose phosphorylated glucose, alpha-methylglucoside, and 2-deoxyglucose. the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of glucose and alpha-methylglucoside by isolated membrane of wild-type or eii mannose negative mutant cells did not require the presence of any soluble protein other than enzyme i and the phosphocarrier protein hpr. this result suggested that oral streptococci do not possess a soluble factor iii glucose. the enzyme ii activities varied as a function of the growth sugar but were not coordinately regulated. the variation elicited by specific sugars was not identical for all the strains tested. nevertheless, in the case of the s. mutans strains, growth at the expense of lactose always caused a significant decrease in the level of enzyme ii activities. finally, experiments conducted with eii mannose negative mutants and also with a pseudorevertant isolated from one of these mutants indicated that the preferential utilization of glucose over lactose by cells growing in mixtures depended on the presence of the eii mannose, but not on glucose-derived metabolites.

TI  == the effect of yoghurt on some components of the gut microflora and on the metabolism of lactose in the rat.
AB  == feeding yoghurt or base milk (from which the yoghurt was prepared by fermentation) to rats increased the counts of coliforms in the gut whereas the counts of lactobacilli were reduced by yoghurt but not by the base milk. lactobacillus bulgaricus survived in the guts of gnotobiotic and conventional rats when yoghurt was fed continuously. streptococcus thermophilus also survived  in gnotobiotic rats but its ability to survive in conventional rats could not be  examined. both organisms failed to colonise the gut when a small inoculum of yoghurt was administered orally to germfree rats maintained on the stock diet. streptococcus thermophilus but not lact. bulgaricus grew in the rat diet when tested in vitro. two enzyme systems (beta-galactosidase and lactase) were studied using, respectively, o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) and lactose as the test substrates. enzyme levels estimated with both substrates increased in the gut contents when rats were fed yoghurt but an increase was only found with onpg in the intestinal mucosa fraction. the bacterial origin of all this increased activity is discussed. the other lactose-containing diets did not affect enzyme activity to the same degree. feeding yoghurt changed the lactobacillus flora from one which was predominantly heterofermentative (lact. reuteri ) to one which was predominantly homofermentative (lact. salivarius).

TI  == sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  == 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. the type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. the enzyme activities were determined  as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. although  variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains,  the same general pattern was noticed. strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like s. sanguis and s. mitior. in some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. the level of sucrase activity in s. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype v/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes i and iv corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype  iii/serotype a always showed low activity. in most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. in all species, exept s. sanguis and s. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity  was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. on the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  == slide-scoring method for estimation of streptococcus mutans levels in saliva.
AB  == a method was developed to facilitate the estimation of s. mutans levels in saliva. paraffin-stimulated saliva was poured on a special slide coated with mitis-salivarius-sucrose agar. two discs containing bacitracin (5 micrograms) were placed on the inoculated slide and the growth density of s. mutans around the bacitracin discs was scored after incubation in candle jars at 37 degrees c for 48 h. the obtained score values correlated well with the numbers of cfu of s. mutans per 1 ml of saliva estimated by a conventional method using mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. the experimental method was further tested by incubating the slides in an atmosphere created by co2-generating tables that were placed into the cover tubes of the slides. these score values were similar to those after conventional incubation. the method is suggested for epidemiologic studies and in selecting persons at high risk for caries and in controlling the effectiveness of prophylactic measures of these patients.

TI  == regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  == in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer  with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts  and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring.  two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine.  g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown  in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for  metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.

TI  == polysaccharide production by cell free transferases in saliva in relation to salivary microflora.
AB  == the supernatant of centrifuged whole saliva was incubated with radiolabeled sucrose to measure polysaccharide production by cell free transferases and to examine whether water-insoluble polysaccharides were produced. amounts of polysaccharides were considered to reflect the level of cell free transferases in saliva. plating samples on blood agar, ms and msb plates gave salivary counts of  total cfu, total streptococci, s. salivarius and s. mutans. the capability of the cell free portion of saliva to produce polymers was confirmed and it appeared that the cell free transferases were able to produce water-insoluble polysaccharides. significant correlations were found between the total and the insoluble polysaccharides from 14c-g'-sucrose and total cfu, total streptococci,  s. salivarius and s. mutans, respectively. heavily s. mutans infected subjects seemed to produce particularly large amounts of water-insoluble polysaccharides from 14c-g'-sucrose. the apparently water-insoluble 14c-f'-polysaccharides correlated significantly to the number of s. salivarius. it was thus concluded that the constitution of the oral microflora and particularly the levels of s. mutans and s. salivarius were of importance for the level of cell free transferase activity.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius strains carry either fibrils or fimbriae on the cell surface.
AB  == strains of streptococcus salivarius were screened by negative staining for the presence of surface structures. two structural subgroups were found, carrying either fibrils or fimbriae, projecting from the cell surface. eight strains carried a very dense peritrichous array of fibrils of two distinct lengths. long  fibrils had an average length of 175 nm, and short fibrils had an average length  of 95 nm. two strains carried only long fibrils, one strain carried only short fibrils, and another strain carried a lateral tuft of very prominent fibrils of two lengths, with a fibrillar fuzz covering the remainder of the cell surface. in all the strains in which they were present, the long fibrils were unaffected by protease or trypsin treatment. in contrast, the short fibrils were completely digested by protease and partially removed by trypsin. neither long nor short fibrils were affected structurally by mild pepsin digestion or by lipase. the lancefield extraction procedure removed both long and short fibrils. these twelve fibrillar strains were therefore divisible into four structural subgroups. extracts of all the fibrillar strains reacted with group k antiserum. the second  main structural subgroup consisted of nine strains of s. salivarius, all of which carried morphologically identical, flexible fimbriae arranged peritrichously over the cell surface. the fimbriae were structurally distinct from fibrils and measured 0.5 to 1.0 micron long and 3 to 4 nm wide, with an irregular outline and no obvious substructure. there was no obvious reduction in the number of fimbriae after protease or trypsin treatment. extracts of the fimbriated strains did not react with the group k antiserum. the two serological and structural subgroups could also be distinguished by colony morphology.

AB  == sugar transport and glycolysis in streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865, streptococcus  mitis atcc 903, streptococcus salivarius nctc 8606 and several strains of streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant ph of 7.0. the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. when this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in kcl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. the na+-inhibition was reproduced in kcl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate k+ and h+ gradients  across the cell membrane. glucose metabolism by strep. mutans b13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of strep. mutans nctc 10449 or strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain b13 than the other two. that ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and kscn. glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the pts inhibitor. lactate or the atpase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (dccd), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-pts uptake system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == purification of proteins similar to hpr and enzyme i from the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius. biochemical and immunochemical properties.
AB  == the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) is made of several  proteins. two of them are designated general proteins because they are required for the transport and phosphorylation of all sugars of the pts. these two proteins are found in the soluble fraction of cellular extracts and are termed hpr and enzyme i (ei). we reported in this work the purification and the characterization of these two proteins from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975.  hpr was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, molecular sieving on ultrogel  aca44, and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the presence of urea revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 6700. the protein contained no tryptophan and had a pi of 4.8. the purification scheme of ei was as follows: deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, deae-sephadex a-50 chromatography, preparative electrophoresis, and molecular sieving on ultrogel aca34. the five-step purification for ei produced a 199-fold purified preparation with a specific activity of 530 mumol of hpr phosphorylated per minute per milligram of protein at 37 degrees c. the fraction obtained after filtration on ultrogel aca34 gave one band (68 000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 135 000, suggesting that it was a dimer. enzyme i had a pi of 4.2,  a ph optimum of 6.7, a km for hpr of about 27 microm, a km for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.48 mm, and kinetics that were consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. evidence had been obtained which indicated that s. salivarius enzyme i was antigenically very similar to enzyme i from various strains of streptococcus mutans, but not to the enzyme from bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli.

TI  == membrane perturbation by cerulenin modulates glucosyltransferase secretion and acetate uptake by streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == cerulenin and dodecanoic acid prevented the synthesis and secretion of glucosyltransferase in non-proliferating cell suspensions of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 under conditions that also inhibited the incorporation of radioactively labelled acetate into the cell. in the presence of tween 80, acetate incorporation was not markedly affected by cerulenin despite the fact that glucosyltransferase secretion was still inhibited. cerulenin and dodecanoic  acid were found to prevent the incorporation of radioactively labelled acetate by affecting the uptake of acetate by the cell. in the case of cerulenin, the inhibition of uptake of acetate by the cell was partially relieved by the addition of tween 80. these and other observations strongly suggested that cerulenin inhibited glucosyltransferase secretion and acetate incorporation by perturbing the membrane, rather than by directly inhibiting lipid synthesis.

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

TI  == interaction of human plasma fibronectin with cariogenic and non-cariogenic oral streptococci.

AB  == a total of 19 strains of oral cytophaga sp. obtained from subgingival plaque deposits were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mutans, s. salivarius, and s. mitis. coaggregation was observed only with a. israelii. based on their coaggregation patterns with eight a. israelii strains, the cytophaga strains were distributed among three distinct groups: those that coaggregated with a. israelii pk16 but not with a. israelii w1011 (atcc 29322), those that coaggregated with a. israelii atcc 29322 but not with a. israelii pk16, and those that coaggregated with none of the eight a. israelii strains. in each of the coaggregations, prior heat treatment (85 degrees c, 30 min) of the cytophaga cells prevented coaggregation, whereas identical treatment of the a. israelii cells had no effect. the ability of a. israelii pk16 to form adherent plaque on a tooth surface previously coated with cytophaga plaque was tested with one of the  coaggregating cytophaga strains. white patches of a. israelii plaque were found covering both the amber-colored cytophaga plaque on the cementum surface as well  as the enamel surface to which cytophaga strains do not adhere. electron micrographs of thin-sectioned mixed-plaque material revealed both cell types in close proximity. in addition, electron micrographs of negatively stained coaggregated cells showed interbacterial adherence between surface fimbrae on a.  israelii and outer membrane blebs on the gram-negative cytophaga sp. the kinetics of binding of a. israelii to spheroidal hydroxyapatite and to root powder were indicative of a high-affinity binding system with comparatively large numbers of  available binding sites on both substrata. these results indicate the highly specific nature of cytophaga sp.--a. israelii recognition. the contribution of such recognition toward the mechanisms that are responsible for the indigenous nature of these oral bacteria is discussed.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide excretion by oral streptococci and effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == approved type strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes  in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (oscn-) in the presence of nadh or nadph were assayed. the effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and  oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. all strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. s. sanguis, s. mitis, and anaerobically grown s. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. there was higher nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than  in anaerobically grown cells. nadph oxidase activity was low in all species. acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. s. sanguis and s. mitis had a higher capacity than s. mutans and s. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. higher activity in the former strains of an nadh-oscn oxidoreductase, which converted oscn- into thiocyanate, explained this  difference. the change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after  inhibition of glycolysis by oscn- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of oscn- indicated that the primary target  of oscn- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

TI  == cysteine toxicity for oral streptococci and effect of branched-chain amino acids.
AB  == cysteine was bactericidal to strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius in concentrations that were nontoxic to s. sanguis, s. milleri, or s. mitior when these microorganisms were incubated in a saliva protein-based synthetic medium. cysteine toxicity for s. mutans also occurred after incubation in synthetic base  medium supplemented with amino acids as the nitrogen source for growth. the bactericidal effect of cysteine for s. mutans or s. salivarius in the saliva protein medium was influenced by the cysteine oxidative activity associated with  the saliva protein fraction. valine alone or in combination with leucine or isoleucine was effective in overcoming cysteine toxicity for susceptible strains  of s. mutans or s. salivarius. cysteine toxicity for these oral streptococci may  be due to cysteine inhibition of an enzymatic step in the valine-leucine biosynthetic pathway.

TI  == purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == the clinical significance of streptococcal species isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci are often isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf); however, the significance of such isolates is poorly understood. in  order to clarify the clinical significance of isolating these organisms from csf, we did a retrospective analysis of 43 patients, from whom eight different species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were recovered. eight patients (19%) had significant infections based on bacteriologic, laboratory, and clinical findings. significant infections were associated with s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. intermedius, s. faecalis, and s. bovis. thirty-five patient isolates (81%) from csf were considered as contaminants, with s. mitis being the most frequently isolated organism (49%). direct gram stain of csf sediment, csf glucose concentration, and csf cell differential were clearly abnormal in most patients with significant infections, in contrast to patients with streptococci isolated as contaminants. cultures of the lumbar puncture skin site yielded streptococci and other bacteria, suggesting a possible reservoir for contaminants.

AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.

TI  == control of sugar utilization in the oral bacteria streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis by the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == three different strep. salivarius (g2, g5 and g29) and two strep. sanguis (gs3 and gs12) mutants affected in the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system were selected on agar plates containing lactose and 2-deoxyglucose. all 5  were defective in a membrane-bound component of the transport system and grew less rapidly than the parent strain in 5 mm glucose-containing medium. mutants g2 and g29 grew poorly in the presence of 5 mm mannose. growth on mixed substrates revealed that the mutants and wild-type parents behaved differently. wild-type strains in medium containing glucose plus another sugar (lactose, galactose, melibiose, raffinose or trehalose for strep. salivarius and lactose, galactose or trehalose for strep. sanguis) always exhausted most of the glucose before utilizing the other sugar. the mutants used the second sugar concurrently or preferentially to glucose. in medium containing glucose plus fructose or mannose, the wild types consumed both sugars concurrently whereas the mutants utilized the second sugar before glucose. mutants g2 and g5 were insensitive to repression by  fructose and released glucose into the medium when grown in the presence of 0.4 per cent lactose. mutant g5 also released galactose. sugar release was not detected with the wild types. the strep. salivarius mutants contained normal levels of glucokinase and beta-galactosidase but g5 was almost totally devoid of  galactokinase activity after growth on lactose. on galactose, the activity was restored. it seems that the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system is involved in the regulation of sugar utilization in these two streptococci.

TI  == inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  == oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system. in a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose pts in batch-grown cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and b13, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitis atcc 903, strep. milleri nctc 10709 and strep. salivarius nctc 8606. intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mm, respectively). this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in ph fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. the effect of  chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at ph 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mm nacl or 135 mm kcl. in general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. addition of the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by nacl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with kcl (except with strep. mutans b13 and strep. mitis atcc 903). the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. the results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in  oral streptococci additional to the pts and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.

TI  == inhibition by acarbose, nojirimycin and 1-deoxynojirimycin of glucosyltransferase produced by oral streptococci.
AB  == acarbose is known to inhibit glucoamylase, maltase and sucrase. our aim was to test whether it would also inhibit glucosyltransferase (gtf), to determine the type of inhibition and to compare the inhibitor potency of acarbose with that of  nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin, two other glucosidase inhibitors. enzyme inhibition was measured either by chemical assay or by incorporation of radioactivity into product. acarbose effectively inhibited the synthesis of polysaccharide by gtf from strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, but not by fructosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius. acarbose  and 1-deoxynojirimycin were more potent inhibitors of gtf than maltose, nojirimycin or various amino sugars. the mechanism of action of these compounds is consistent with competitive inhibition.

TI  == enocin: an antibiotic produced by streptococcus salivarius that may contribute to protection against infections due to group a streptococci.
AB  == clinical studies have indicated that certain constituents of the normal throat flora may play a role in resistance to group a streptococcal infections. strains  of streptococcus salivarius were among the most active components of this protective flora. the present studies were designed to determine the mechanism responsible for the antagonism of group a streptococci by s. salivarius. cell-free filtrates made at the end of the logarithmic growth phase of s. salivarius inhibited the growth of group a streptococci. the only other organisms susceptible to inhibition by these filtrates were those that require exogenous pantothenate, as group a streptococci do. the activity of filtrates was primarily bacteriostatic and could be specifically reversed by pantothenate. activity was not due to a simple depletion of the vitamin but rather to the presence of a substance that interfered with the utilization of pantothenate. this substance, given the name enocin, was heat labile but was unaffected by proteolytic enzymes. thus, strains of s. salivarius that appear to enhance the resistance of certain individuals to streptococcal infection may exert their protective effect through  in situ production of the antibiotic enocin.

AB  == plaque developed in 10 occlusal fissures from unerupted third molars during implantation for 200 to 270 days in lower molars of dental students was studied.  to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 592 isolates (51 to 67 from each fissure) were subcultured from anaerobic roll tubes. twenty-eight of the isolates were lost. streptococci constituted 8 to 86% (median, 45%) of the isolates, streptococcus mutans constituted 0 to 86% (median, 25%) and s. sanguis  constituted 0 to 15% (median, 1%). a few isolates of "s. mitior" and "s. milleri" were found, but no s. salivarius. staphylococci made up 0 to 23% (median, 9%). gram-positive rods constituted 6 to 59% (median, 35%). of these, 0 to 46% (median, 18%) were actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus, but no anaerobic actinomyces were isolated. arachnia and propionibacteria made up small proportions, lactobacilli were isolated from two fissures, constituting 10 and 29%, and eubacteria were isolated from one fissure (27%). gram-negative cocci made up 0 to 46% (media, 4%). only two isolates of gram-negative rods were found, both facultative anaerobes. although 8 of the 10 fissures had large proportions of s. mutans, lactobacilli, or both, no caries was found even with microradiography. the large individual variation probably reflects differences in initial colonization from saliva and in growth conditions in each fissure.

TI  == production of lipoteichoic acid by lactobacilli and streptococci grown in different environments.
AB  == representative strains of streptococcus sanguis serotype 2 and of four lactobacillus species were examined for the production of cellular and extracellular lipoteichoic acid (lta) when grown at ph 6.0 in batch culture to the stationary phase with either glucose or fructose. extracellular lta was a minor component in all cases except for l. fermentum and l. casei nird r094 grown in fructose. the total amount of lta (cellular and extracellular) produced by fructose-grown cultures was also considerably greater for these two strains, for  l. salivarius, and also two of the s. sanguis strains. growth of l. fermentum and l. casei in continuous culture in a chemostat showed that generation time and ph  of growth can influence the total amount of lta and the proportion of extracellular material. the results for glucose-limited cultures were quite disparate, with l. fermentum forming considerably more extracellular lta than l.  casei. however, in fructose-limited cultures l. fermentum formed less total lta and l. casei more so that the differences were only minor. a difference in the utilization of glucose and fructose by the heterofermentative l. fermentum and the homofermentative l. casei strains is also indicated by differences in the yield of organisms at different dilution rates in continuous culture.

TI  == effect of mechanical and chemical plaque control measures on oral microflora in schoolchildren.
AB  == the incidence of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, total streptococci and lactobacilli was examined in highly caries active 13-14-year-old schoolchildren participating in a prophylactic program. after 1 year of trial, professional toothcleaning once every second week markedly reduced the frequency of gingivitis and the caries increment. bimonthly topical applications of a 0.5% chlorhexidine  gel with or without subsequent rinsing with 2% nfp had no effect on plaque score  and gingivitis but tended to reduce the caries activity. no significant changes were found in the groups with regard to the salivary number of total streptococci and s. sanguis. a reduction of the population of s. salivarius, s. mutans and lactobacilli was observed in the chlorhexidine group. in the group where chlorhexidine was combined with mfp, only s. mutans was reduced.

TI  == microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low ph isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  == longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml)  at ph levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both ph and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. strains of streptococcus and neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at ph levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. the most commonly isolated streptococci were streptococcus mitior and s. salivarius. s. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at ph 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at ph 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. despite their known fluoride resistance, actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. the ph of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at ph 6.0 was only 30% of that at ph 7.0. representative strains of s. mutans, s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the ph and fluoride levels of the  medium on which they were initially isolated. fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount  of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. the isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the ph range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric s. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. in the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may  permit s. mitior to compete with s. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

TI  == inorganic pyrophosphatase activity in oral streptococci: purification and properties of the enzyme from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == inorganic pyrophosphatase has been purified from the soluble fraction of streptococcus salivarius by protamine sulfate treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on sephadex g-200 and deae-cellulose. the enzyme was purified approximately 500-fold with a 33% yield. the purified enzyme  was homogeneous since it showed a single band when examined by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. it was rich in acidic (glutamic and aspartic) amino acids, as well as serine and glycine. the enzyme was devoid of sulfur-containing amino acids. the purified enzyme was specific for the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate and did not hydrolyze any other phosphate-ester compound examined. inorganic pyrophosphatase activity was completely dependent on a divalent cation. activity was maximum in the presence of mg2+ while activity in the presence of mn2+ and co2+ was significantly lower.  in the presence of mg2+, a number of divalent cations, however, inhibited the enzyme activity. the true substrates for s. salivarius inorganic pyrophosphatase  were magnesium-pyrophosphate complexes, i.e., mgppi and mg2ppi, while free mg2+ had no effect on the enzyme activity and free ppi inhibited the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate. km value for magnesium-pyrophosphate complexes was 16.4  microm. km value for total mg2+ was similar ranging between 14.4 and 20 microm. analysis of data by hill plots indicated one binding site for mg2+ and two for ppi. among various nucleotides and glycolytic intermediates examined, gdp, gmp, and fructose-1, 6-p2 showed significant inhibitory effect on enzyme activity.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == glucose transport in streptococcus salivarius. evidence for the presence of a distinct phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system which catalyses the phosphorylation of alpha-methyl glucoside.
AB  == a spontaneous mutant of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 was isolated by inoculating an agar medium containing 11 mm lactose and 0.5 mm 2-deoxyglucose. this mutant grew poorly on 5 mm glucose but almost as well as the parental strain on 110 mm glucose. uptake of 2-deoxyglucose was abolished by the mutation, and phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase activity could not be detected with toluenized cells under normal conditions when the glucose concentration was  below 5 mm. data from growth experiments, glycolysis, and uptake studies indicated the presence of a second phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system that could catalyze the phosphorylation of alpha-methyl glucoside. the activity of this system was detected by a spectrophotometric assay coupled with lactate dehydrogenase and by a radioactive isotope method using methyl alpha-d-[u-14c] glucoside. the phosphorylation was phosphoenolpyruvate dependent. the apparent km of the system for glucose and alpha-methyl glucoside was approximately 20 mm. studies with energy poisons ruled out the possibility of an active transport system, and accumulation of alpha-methyl glucoside argued against facilitated diffusion. it was concluded that the other glucose transport  system which allowed growth of the mutant strain of s. salivarius was a second phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system.

TI  == oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  == s. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque  from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. nearly all of 107 isolated s. mutans strains belonged to  the serotype group c/e/f. the proportion of s. sanguis, in contrast to those of s. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. the proportions of s. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or  clinically-sound tooth surfaces. the findings provide further support for the role of s. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. in the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. in addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.

AB  == the enolase from a highly fluoride-sensitive strain of streptococcus salivarius and its fluoride-resistant mutant, as well as those from strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans with intermediate and low sensitivities to fluoride have been shown to be inhibited by fluoride. comparisons of the purified, strain-specific enzymes showed a high degree of similarity for all preparations. the michaelis constants for the substrate 2-phosphoglycerate were 1.3 x 10(-4) to 2.4 x 10(-4) m, ph optima were 7.3 to 7.7, and mg2+ optima were 2 meq/liter for all. inhibition by fluoride required the presence of inorganic phosphate and was competitive in nature, and the calculated modified inhibition indices were found to be in the range from 3.3 x 10(-14) to 5.8 x 10(-14) m4. percent inhibitions were determined under standardized conditions (0.16 mm naf, 2 mm mgso4, 0.5 mm pi, and 0.5 mm 2-phosphoglycerate) and were found to range from  53.3 to 65.9% for all of the purified enzymes. the differences do not appear to be meaningful metabolically. inhibition was reduced to about 14% at ph 6.0. from  the similarities in the behavior of the strain-specific enzymes it is concluded that the differences in the glycolytic sensitivities of the different strains of  streptococci to fluoride are not the consequence of any kinetic differences between the respective enolases.

AB  == microbial succession, experimental cariogenicity, and sucrose metabolism were examined in dental plaques which developed on sterile bovine enamel inserts in acrylic palatal appliances. the appliances were worn for a period of 14 days by 10 caries-free and 10 caries-susceptible human volunteers. three of six enamel inserts on each appliance were exposed extraorally to 10% sucrose in 0.85% saline six times a day, and three were exposed simultaneously to 0.85% saline as a control environment. the responses of the plaques to the high-sucrose environment in both caries status populations were compared. in all plaques, exposure to 10%  sucrose stimulated the succession of veillonella spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus salivarius, and, to a lesser extent, streptococcus mutans and a decline in levels of streptococcus sanguis, neisseria spp., and gram-negative anaerobic rods. plaques from caries-free mouths, in contrast to those from caries-susceptible mouths, harbored higher levels of veillonella spp., gram-negative anaerobic rods, and neisseria spp. and lower levels of lactobacillus spp. sucrose-exposed plaques from caries-free mouths also induced less enamel microhardness changes and formed less lactic acid from [14c]sucrose during a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees c than did comparable plaques from caries-susceptible mouths. the experiments revealed consistent differences in the ecological response to a cariogenic substrate environment in plaques from the two populations, with plaques from caries-free subjects exhibiting less cariogenic potential than those from caries-susceptible subjects.

TI  == inactivation of cell-associated fructosyltransferase in streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in stationary phase, 95% of the fructosyltransferase (ftase) activity of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 was found associated with the cells. within the first 15 min after inoculation into fresh medium, the specific activity of cell-associated ftase decreased by 92% of its initial value. after this period of initial loss, the enzyme was synthesized during exponential growth until a maximum level equivalent to that present before inoculation was obtained. the inactivation of ftase was also demonstrated in a nongrowing system. washed cell suspensions incubated at 37 degrees c in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (ph 6.5) containing 10 microm cu2+ lost 80 to 95% of their frase activity after 30 min. this loss could be prevented by the addition of histidine, cysteine, or ca2+ to the suspension mixture. a factor(s) essential for the inactivation of cell-associated ftase could itself be preferentially inactivated by heating cells at 40 degrees c for periods of up to 3 h, or by storage of cells at 0 to 4 degrees c for several days in a low-ionic-strength, low-ph, potassium phosphate buffer. treatment of cells with the n-acetylmuramidase enzyme m-1, in the presence of 0.5 m melezitose, resulted in the release of ftase from the cell. the released enzyme was recovered in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 160,000 x g for 90 min. comparison of solubilized active and inactivated ftase preparations by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the inactivation of cell-associated ftase activity was associated with the loss of specific protein bands.

AB  == the intra- and intergeneric relationships of the genus staphylococcus, and the phylogenetic position of peptococcus saccharolyticus and micrococcus (staphylococcus salivarius), were investigated by comparative oligonucleotide cataloguing of 16s rrna. all the staphylococci investigated form a phylogenetically coherent group at the genus level that, in addition, contains the anaerobic species peptococcus saccharolyticus. the genus staphylococcus belongs to the broad bacillus-lactobacillus-streptococcus cluster that is defined by gram-positive bacteria with a low dna g+c content. micrococcus mucilaginosus is not a genuine member of the genus micrococcus. the binary matching coefficients between the 16s rrna of micrococcus mucilaginosus and those representatives of the arthrobacter/micrococcus group and related genera indicate that micrococcus mucilaginosus should be regarded as a member of a new genus.

TI  == identification of a streptococcus salivarius cell wall component mediating coaggregation with veillonella alcalescens v1.
AB  == cell walls of streptococcus salivarius hb aggregated veillonella alcalescens v1,  but cell walls of the mutant s. salivarius hb-v5 did not. we found no correlation between the presence of fimbriae on streptococcal walls and the ability to aggregate veillonella strains. treatment of the walls with lysozyme solubilized a fraction which possessed veillonella-aggregating activity. solubilized cell wall  preparations of strain hb contained three major (glyco)proteins as determined by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and at least four antigens as determined by immunoelectrophoresis with antiserum prepared against strain hb walls. a specific antiserum, which was obtained by adsorption of anti-hb serum on strain hb-v5 cells, contained monospecific antibody that reacted with the solubilized strain hb wall preparation. similar fractions prepared from  strain hb-v5 cell walls did not possess aggregating activity and lacked one protein band (protein i) after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and one antigen (antigen b) after immunoelectrophoresis. the same antigen was absent when lysozyme-solubilized wall preparations of strain hb were  reacted with anti-hb-v5 serum. crossed-immunoisoelectric focusing indicated that  this specific (glyco)protein and this antigen were identical and had an isoelectric point of 4.60. protein i and antigen b were specifically adsorbed when solubilized strain hb cell walls were incubated with v. alcalescens v1 but were not adsorbed by nonaggregating veillonella parvula atcc 10790 cells. culture supernatants of strain hb contained v. alcalescens v1-aggregating activity. antigen b was present in the culture supernatant, but was not found in cultures of strain hb-v5. a total of 18 s. salivarius isolates possessing the streptococcal group k antigen released aggregating activity and antigen b into the culture medium, but 11 strains which lacked the k-antigen did not.

TI  == interference of secretory immunoglobulin a with sorption of oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == the potential of secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (ha) beads. the importance of specific s-iga antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral s-iga, polymeric myeloma iga, or preabsorbed s-iga. specific antibody molecules bound at the ha surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two streptococcus sanguis strains. in contrast, ha-bound s-iga antibodies inhibited the sorption of streptococcus mitior and streptococcus salivarius. the same was true for streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to ha. comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of iga or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with s-iga or myeloma iga added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. salivarius, and glucose-grown s. mutans was partly attributable to functions of s-iga antibodies. under the in vitro conditions of the study, s-iga antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown s. mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii to ha. the results indicated that s-iga can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to ha by several different functions.

AB  == because human lungs are repetitively inoculated with the normal bacterial flora of the pharynx, we determined the pulmonary clearance of representative species after aerosol inoculation of a murine model, and characterized the phagocytic cell response by bronchoalveolar lavage. viable bacteria remaining in the lungs at 1, 2, and 4 h were: streptococcus sanguis, 24%, 8%, and 1%; streptococcus salivarius, 49%, 24%, and 5%; neisseria catarrhalis, 69%, 49%, and 22%. clearance of streptococcus sanguis was associated with a twofold increase in alveolar macrophages (p less than 0.05); streptococcus salivarius evoked a doubling of alveolar macrophages and a 20-fold rise in granulocytes (p less than 0.05); the response to neisseria catarrhalis was a 400-fold increase in granulocytes (p less than 0.05). thus, normal pharyngeal organisms are cleared rapidly from the lung by a dual phagocytic cell system. it is speculated that bacteria-phagocyte interaction allows the possibility of lung injury from proteolytic enzymes released from either set of phagocytes.

AB  == bacteria in culture medium at 37 degrees c were subjected to eight puffs of smoke from one cigarette, and viable cell counts were done at intervals ranging from 0  min to 3 h after exposure to smoke. the cigarette contained 23.0 mg of tar and 1.4 mg of nicotine. each 25.0 ml puff of smoke from a mechanical smoking apparatus was passed over a 1.0 ml suspension of bacteria dispersed over a 25 cm2 surface in a sterile flask. filtered air was in contact with the suspension between puffs, and during the intervals between smoke treatment and viable cell counts being done. there was a marked decrease in numbers of viable branhamella catarrhalis at 15 min after exposure to smoke, and by 1 h there were no viable cells in suspensions which originally contained 10(7) bacteria. no reduction in the number of viable branhamella catarrhalis occurred in an untreated suspension  of the micro-organism. there was a marked decrease in viable neisseria perflava at 30 min, and by 3 h there were no viable cells. there was a 4 to 5 log10 reduction of viable neisseria sicca compared with untreated bacteria at 3 h after exposure to smoke. streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis were less susceptible to the harmful action of cigarette smoke, and by 3 h there were 1 to 2 log10 differences in viable cell counts between smoke-treated and untreated bacteria. non-filter cigarette smoke had a greater detrimental effect on all species of bacteria studied than smoke from filter-tipped cigarettes.

TI  == studies on streptococci. i. distribution of fecal streptococci in man.
AB  == to understand the significance to the host of streptococci as part of the intestinal microflora, we first tried to investigate the distribution of human fecal streptococci on the species level. of the selective media compared, kmn agar was more effective than the other media for the isolation of streptococci from human feces. we made an effort to improve streptococcal classification. especially we used utilization of 1% pyruvate, 1% arginine, and 1% citrate for differentiation between streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. in a tellurite tolerance test, s. faecalis was distinguished more clearly from s. faecium in the medium containing 0.16 or 0.32% tellurite. we devised methods of presumptive identification of fecal streptococci from the results of the characteristics of 1,442 isolates. these methods enabled us to identify many strains rapidly. different results in the distribution of species of streptococci between children and adults were observed. s. faecalis and s. faecium were isolated constantly from both groups. s. bovis and s. avium were isolated frequently from the feces of children. on the other hand, "viridans" streptococci, e.g. s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. mg-intermedius were present at a high frequency in, and no s. avium  could be isolated from, the feces of adults.

AB  == soluble extracellular antigens (esa) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of streptococcus sanguis omz 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a bio-gel p6 column. soluble cell wall antigens (wea) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 m phosphate buffer (ph 6). antisera against whole cells of s. sanguis and  s. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell  walls, dextran, esa, and wea were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. esa and wea were prepared from a representative strain  of bratthall's seven serological groups, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus. all sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. the comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both esa and wea between the different strains. absorption of anti-esa sera with  wea, and anti-wea sera with esa, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in esa and wea.

TI  == adherence of streptococcus salivarius hb and hb-7 to oral surfaces and saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  == we compared the binding of streptococcus salivarius hb and the mutant hb-7 to oral surfaces in vivo. mutant hb-7 does not aggregate with saliva nor does it bind to buccal epithelium, but it does retain its ability to coaggregate with veillonella and fusobacterium. at 1 h after inoculation into the oral cavity of six volunteers, significantly more s. salivarius hb than hb-7 cells were found adhering to the buccal mucosa (p < 0.05) and to a cleaned tooth surface (p < 0.01); there was no significant difference in the numbers adhering to the tongue. the ratio of hb to hb-7 on the tongue increased in samples taken 1, 3, and 9 days after inoculation. the average time required to clear the mutant hb-7 from the oral cavity was 7 days, whereas that for the parent hb was greater than 20 days,  and in some cases strain hb was still present 3 months after its inoculation. a representative s. salivarius serotype ii strain, designated t3, behaved similarly to mutant hb-7 with respect to its adherence to the buccal mucosa. strain hb adhered better to hydroxyapatite treated with human saliva than mutant hb-7; both strains adhered in similar numbers to untreated hydroxyapatite. hydroxyapatite treated with rat saliva bound less hb than hydroxyapatite treated with human saliva, corresponding to the lower aggregating activity of rat saliva. extraction of saliva with aggregating strains of s. salivarius reduced the ability of saliva to mediate attachment of strain hb to hydroxyapatite.

TI  == virulence-related physiological changes and antigenic variation in populations of streptococcus mutans colonizing gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if populations of streptococcus mutans which were undergoing antigenic variation while colonizing gnotobiotic rats concomitantly became altered in physiological characteristics which affected their virulence. s. mutans strain jbp (serotype c), which was freshly isolated from a carious lesion in a 6-year old child, was used to inoculate gnotobiotic rats; uninfected animals served as controls. substrains were isolated from animals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks after infection; samples of pilocarpine-stimulated saliva were also obtained from representative animals for  antibody analyses. isolates derived from stock cultures of strain jbp proved to be homogeneous with respect to all of the physiological characteristics monitored. however, substrains isolated from the animals within 4 weeks after infection were altered with respect to their ability to agglutinate in the presence of sucrose, their ability to form adherent growth in sucrose broth, and  the terminal ph attained in glucose broth. some isolates obtained 12 weeks after  infection no longer synthesized detectable levels of c antigen or intracellular glycogen, and they formed atypical smooth colonies on mitis salivarius agar. with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, low levels of immunoglobulin a (iga) antibodies reactive with whole jbp cells were detected in saliva samples of uninfected control animals at each sampling period; these evidently were induced  to antigens contained in the diet of the animals. significantly higher levels of  iga antibodies were present in saliva samples from animals infected with strain jbp for 3 weeks or longer. thus, the emergence of antigenic and physiological variants of s. mutans in the animals was paralleled by increased levels of salivary iga antibodies. the reactivity of salivary igg with jbp cells was low, and it fluctuated in both groups of animals. no antibodies of the igm class were  detected. when tested in gnotobiotic rats, several variants, including strains which no longer formed typical rough colonies or adherent growth in sucrose broth, proved much less virulent than parental strain jbp in inducing carious lesions. prior oral immunization, which resulted in higher levels of salivary and serum iga antibodies reactive with strain jbp, was found to accelerate the emergence of smooth-colony variants in the animals; it was also associated with decreased streptococcal population levels on the teeth and in feces of the rats.  it is suggested that part of the mechanism by which artificial immunization leads to a reduction in dental caries development in experimental animals is due to the earlier selection of less virulent streptococcal populations.

TI  == characterization of the adherence properties of streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the adherence and aggregation properties of 46 human oral streptococcus salivarius isolates were examined. a total of 41% of the isolates aggregated with whole human saliva, 50% aggregated with human erythrocytes, and 85% adhered to human buccal epithelial cells. strains that aggregated with saliva and erythrocytes usually reacted with streptococcus group k typing serum whereas the  non-hemagglutinating strains did not. k+ strains also adhered more strongly to human buccal epithelial cells than k- strains. all isolates coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum lf and bacteroides asaccharolyticus 2d, 91% coaggregated  with veillonella alcalescens v1, and 50% coaggregated with veillonella parvula v4. s. salivarius hb aggregated with saliva from 15 different human donors and aggregated with human erythrocytes irrespective of the blood group. this strain only weakly aggregated with rat saliva or rat erythrocytes. we isolated mutants which concomitantly lost the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes, aggregate with  saliva, and bind to buccal epithelial cells, but retained their interbacterial aggregation properties. a second class of mutants lost the ability to coaggregate with veillonella, but these mutants retained all of the other aggregation properties. treatment of s. salivarius hb cells with pronase or subtilisin destroyed their ability to aggregate with saliva and erythrocytes and to bind to  buccal epithelial cells. the unique characteristics of the aggregation and adherence reactions were suggested by differences in the rate of loss of activity during protease treatment and in the response to chemical modification. the presence of saliva did not affect hemagglutination and adherence to buccal epithelial cells. binding of the salivary aggregating factor to the bacteria could be distinguished from aggregation on the basis that the latter required divalent cations. the factor involved in coaggregation with f. nucleatum lf was physicochemically different from the other factors, since it was resistant to heat and to extraction with trichloroacetic acid, aqueous phenol, sodium dodecyl  sulfate, and formamide, but was sensitive to proteases and was present in both classes of mutants. coaggregation with v. alcalescens was not sensitive to proteases. a variety of mono- and disaccharides had no influence on any of the reactions tested.

AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == structure of the water-insoluble alpha-d-glucan of streptococcus salivarius hht.
AB  == water-insoluble, non-adherent alpha-d-glucans have been obtained from streptococcus salivarius hht under two sets of conditions: from a growing culture, or synthesized enzymically by using a glucosyltransferase. in the former case, the glucan ([alpha]d + 197 degrees) was shown by methylation analysis to have a slightly branched structure containing a relatively high proportion (80%)  of (1 leads to 3)-alpha-d-glucosidic linkages, together with small proportions of (1 leads to 6)- and (1 leads to 4)-alpha-d-glucosidic linkages. the enzymically synthesized glucan had a much less-branched structure, containing 88% of (1 leads to 3)-alpha-d-glucosidic linkages. both glucans, on smith degradation (sequential periodate oxidation, borohydride reduction, and mild acid hydrolysis), gave linear, (1 leads to 3)-alpha-d-glucosidic polysaccharides (yields, 82--90%) that  constitute the backbone chains. the presence of small proportions of glycerol, erythritol, 1-o-alpha-d-glucosyl-d-glycerol, and also 2-o-alpha-d-glucosyl-d-erythritol in the products of smith degradation suggests that the short side-chains are attached to the backbone chain by (1 leads to 4)-, (1 leads to 6)-, and (1 leads to 3)-alpha-d-glucosidic linkages.

TI  == in vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  == a mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. adsorption in this model can be expressed by the langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (ka) and the number of binding sites (n), kan. with this approach, streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better  (kan = [187 +/- 72] x 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (kan = [97 +/- 84] x 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. to analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 x 10(9) cells per ml) of 3h-labeled serotype 1, reference strain s. sanguis g9b, were performed. these studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. competition studies using serotype 2 s. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain g9b to hydroxyapatite. scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. the results of competition studies with s. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.

TI  == interactions between human serum proteins and oral streptococci reveal occurrence of receptors for aggregated beta 2-microglobulin.
AB  == a total of 31 strains of oral streptococci representing streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus milleri were tested for possible binding of human immunoglobulins g, g1, g2, g3, g4, a1, a2, m1, and m2 and haptoglobin, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, and aggregated beta 2-microglobulin. radiolabeled beta 2-microglobulin in aggregated form showed affinity for 20 of the 31 strains tested. binding activity for the protein was found in strains belonging to all five species. the bacterial receptor was resistant to trypsin. monomeric, unlabeled beta 2-microglobulin did  not interfere with the binding of the aggregated form. of the other proteins tested, only the immunoglobulin a1 protein showed positive binding, and that was  only with a single strain of s. milleri. beta 2-microglobulin is present on all nucleated cell membranes in vivo. the reaction between aggregated beta 2-microglobulin and oral streptococci is a new type of human-bacterium interaction which should be considered in studies of bacterial adherence.

TI  == circulating immune complexes in experimental streptococcal endocarditis: a monitor of therapeutic efficacy.
AB  == an important problem in the management of infective endocarditis has been the delineation of laboratory procedures that are sensitive, reliable indicators of therapeutic efficacy. because circulating, complement-containing immune complexes of the igg type (cics) have been demonstrated in most humans with infective endocarditis, serum cic levels during the natural course of the infection and in  response to penicillin therapy were studied in 42 rabbits with right-sided endocarditis due to streptococcus salivarius. a significant rise in the level of  cics in both 21 control rabbits and 21 treated rabbits was observed after induction but before treatment of infective endocarditis (p less than 0.01). in the 17 successfully treated rabbits, cic levels fell sharply during the first week of therapy and remained at preinduction levels thereafter (p less than 0.005). in contrast, cic values did not change significantly either in control animals or in the four treated animals with refractory endocarditis, although in  the latter animals, serum bactericidal titers remained less than or equal to 1:32. these findings suggest that serial measurements of cic levels during antimicrobial therapy of infective endocarditis may aid in monitoring therapeutic efficacy.

TI  == bacterial and strain specificities in opsonization, phagocytosis and killing of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == opsonization of streptococcus mutans, followed by phagocytosis and killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been postulated as an effector mechanism in protection against dental caries. opsonization was studied by using sera from monkeys immunized with killed strep. mutans (sero-type c) and compared with sera  from sham-immunized monkeys. antibodies to strep. mutans (sero-type c) induced maximal phagocytosis and killing of serotypes c and e, and this was significantly greater than with serotypes a and d; there was no significant phagocytosis or killing of serotype b. there was little or no opsonization with actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei, strep, sanguis and strep. salivarius. the exception was strep. cht which showed significant phagocytosis and killing. the results suggest that immunization with the serotype c strain of strep. mutans might offer protection against four of the five common serotypes of this organism.

AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and a. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (bgr) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. the bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type a or b reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the a and b antigenic determinants were not involved. the organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of bgr mucin molecules because preparations  absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained bgr molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed bgr components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. differences were even noted among s.  mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of  anti-human immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, or igm serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to s. mutans h12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups  played an essential role. active cell metabolism was not required for bgr mucin binding; however, pretreatment of h12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees c for 15 min) reduced binding. mucin labeled with [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to s. mutans h12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. binding of [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. however, binding was inhibited by several amines. bgr salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability  of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.

TI  == co-induction of beta-galactosidase and the lactose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system in streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the addition of lactose, galactose, or isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (iptg) to glucose-grown cells of streptococcus salivarius 25975 resulted in the co-induction of both the lactose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (lactose-pts) and beta-galactosidase, with the latter the predominant metabolic system. with various strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis 10556, on the other hand, the lactose-pts was the major metabolic pathway with beta-galactosidase induced either to low or negligible levels. in all cases, induction of the lactose-pts resulted in the concomitant induction of 6-p-beta-galactosidase. the induction by lactose of both the lactose-pts and beta-galactosidase in all strains was repressed by glucose and other catabolites, notably, fructose. induction of beta-galactosidase in s. salivarius 25975 by iptg was, however, relatively resistant to glucose repression. induction experiments with iptg and lactose suggested that a cellular metabolite of lactose metabolism  was a repressor of enzyme activity. exogenous camp was shown to reverse the transient repression by glucose of beta-galactosidase induction in cells of s. salivarius 25975 receiving lactose, provided the cells were grown with small amounts of toluene to overcome the permeability barrier to this nucleotide, camp, was however, unable to overcome the permanent repression of beta-galactosidase activity to a significant extent under these conditions.

AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  == various factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. when the ph of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. when the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture ph values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. adjusting the final ph of these cultures to below 5.5 with hcl caused the cells to aggregate. cells from unsupplemented cultures with final ph values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at ph values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees c) occurred rapidly at ph values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher ph values. aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low ph and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. low ph values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus.

AB  == extracellular products of 12 strains of streptococcus mutans and 5 additional species of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to inhibit proliferation of fibroblastoid cells (hela and av3) and blast transformation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from normal individuals. products from s. mutans strains aht and bht, streptococcus intermedius, and actinomyces viscosus inhibited [3h]thymidine uptake by fibroblastoid cells and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. products from s. mutans e49, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces naeslundii inhibited blast transformation of human lymphocytes but did not significantly inhibit the growth  of fibroblastoid cells. preparations from s. intermedius gave the greatest inhibitory activity against both target cell types; initial characterization of this preparation suggested a single factor active in both assays, in that the heat lability and sephadex g-200 elution profile were similar for the inhibitory  activity seen with the two cell types. the molecular weight of the inhibitor, estimated by gel filtration on sephadex g-200 and ultragel aca34, was approximately 160,000. the results strongly suggest that oral bacteria produce heat-labile substances that interfere with fibroblast proliferation and alter the lymphocytic immunological response.

AB  == the beta plasmid from streptococcus faecalis strain ds5, which codes for resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin, was introduced into a lancefield group f streptococcus, strain dr1501, by transformation. this strain, dr1501 (beta), was found to be an excellent donor of the beta plasmid and readily transferred the resistance markers to various lactic acid bacteria, including certain strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius. evidence is presented indicating that the transfer of the beta plasmid is mediated by a mechanism that requires cell-to-cell contact. the transfer of plasmid dna during conjugation has been confirmed by the isolation of beta plasmid from transconjugant clones and by their ability to then serve as donors of the erythromycin and lincomycin resistance markers.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

AB  == the gastrointestinal microflora and gastric physiology of piglets weaned at 2 days was compared with that of piglets allowed to continue sucking the sow. although there was a significantly higher count of escherichia coli in the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum of the early-weaned compared with sow-reared pigs, these differences were not detectable in samples from the ileum. there were no quantitative differences in lactobacilli and in streptococci between the two treatments. lactobacillus fermentum, l. acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius, s. bovis, and related biotypes were isolated from both groups of pigs. l. fermentum  and s. salivarius were isolated more frequently from sow-reared piglets. the weight of digesta in the stomach was greater in weaned than in sucking pigs and was even greater in scouring weaned pigs, suggesting that in scouring pigs there  may be gastric stasis. the gastric ph was higher in the weaned pigs at 4 days of  age, but gradually decreased up to 10 days, during which time the lactic acid concentration rose. in weaned pigs there was a highly significant negative correlation between ph and lactic acid concentration in the stomach digesta, and  also a positive correlation between ph and number of e. coli. these correlations  suggest that lactic acid, from bacterial fermentation, is the major component in  the regulation of gastric ph in weaned pigs. three of twenty sucking pigs, but none of the weaned pigs, were secreting hcl (chloride concentration > 3 mg/g, ph  < 3.5). in sucking pigs there was an inverse relationship between the chloride and lactic acid concentrations in the digesta. in weaned scouring pigs there was  a nonsignificant increase in pepsin concentration in the stomach tissue. there was a threefold increase in the total proteolytic activity of the stomach tissue.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

TI  == new method for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

TI  == determinants of the developing oral flora in normal newborns.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus species to selectively adhere to the oral epithelial cells of newborns was studied in vitro. on day 1 of life, mucosal cells from normal infants demonstrated selective attraction for the natural distribution of  streptococci that would soon colonize these surfaces. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis adhered well in vitro to scraped cells from cheek and tongue surfaces. streptococcus mutans, on the other hand, exhibited feeble or no  adherence to cheek or tongue cells. adherence of escherichia coli to oral epithelial cells was also studied. the ability of strains of e. coli to adhere to cheek and tongue cells correlated solely with the presence of cell surface substances, probably pili. these observations, made on infants at the critical moment of their developing flora, strengthen the hypothesis that the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is an important determinant of their ecological place in the oral microflora.

TI  == properties of a mutant of streptococcus mutans altered in glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  == a mutant of streptococcus mutans gs-5 has been isolated as a smooth colonial variant on mitis salivarius agar. this mutant, designated sng-1, adheres to glass surfaces as well as the parental organism when grown in the presence of sucrose.  however, in contrast to the parental organism, glucose-grown cultures of the mutant did not adhere to smooth surfaces when incubated with sucrose under nongrowing conditions. the inability of the mutant organism to adhere to glass surfaces under the latter condition was a result to markedly reduced levels of mutant cell-associated glucosyltransferase activity. in addition, the extracellular activity of the mutant was also severely depressed relative to the  parental activity. the reduced levels of mutant enzyme activity appear to be a result of a mutation in a structural gene coding for glucosyltransferase activity since (i) mutant glucosyltransferase activity is much less resistant to heat inactivation compared to the parental enzymes and (ii) the migration patterns of  the mutant and parental enzymes differ on polyacrylamide gels and after isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. however, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes are similar to those of the comparable parental activities in  terms of ph and temperature optima and km values for sucrose. the mutant enzyme responsible for soluble glucan synthesis has been purified approximately 300-fold. these results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of glucan synthesis by s. mutans.

TI  == selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

TI  == structural differences in fructans elaborated by streptococcus mutans and strep.  salivarius.
AB  == d-fructans synthesized from sucrose by cell-free systems of strains of streptococcus mutans and strep. salivarius have been shown by methylation and enzymatic studies to have different glycosidic linkages. the cold water-insoluble d-fructans from strep. mutans strain bht and jc-1 have inulin-type structures consisting beta-(2 leads to 1)-d-fructofuranosidic linkages, with average repeating units of 8 and 27 sugar residues, respectively, whereas the water-soluble fructan from strep. salivarius strain hht has a levan-type branched structure consisting beta-(2 leads to 6)-d-fructofuranosidic linkages with an average repeating unit of 9 sugar residues. the solubility properties of these fructants are discussed on the basis of the structural differences.

TI  == [nasopharyngeal microorganisms--antagonists of meningococci].
AB  == a study was made of the species composition of symbiotic microbial flora of the nasopharynx in healthy persons and meningococcus carriers, inhibiting in vitro the growth of the test strains of miningococci. saprophytic streptococci and particularly str. salivarius served as the principal and the most active antagonists of meningococci in both groups of the persons examined. comparison of the inhibitory activity of antagonists in the groups examined revealed no significant differences. however, there were seen differences in the quantitative composition of the isolated antagonists: saprophytic streptococci, particularly str. salivarius were isolated in great amounts, and more frequently from healthy  individuals, and nondifferentiated gram positive cocci of conditionally distinguished group--from carriers. taking into consideration the high inhibitory activity of str. salivarius it is supposed that it can be used as an indicator of the state of insensitiveness of the human organism to the meningococcus infection.

TI  == membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  == a membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. the procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. the procedure (me) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. neither s. bovis, s. equinus, s. mitis, nor s. salivarius grew on the medium. the selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 c. about 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci  confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact,  identified as enterococci. plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the me procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the kf method by one order of magnitude.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  == an indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. an electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. this labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with s. salivarius and s. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. these cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. no cross-reactions occurred with s. mutans, s. faecalis, actinomyces species, or bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed  to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.

TI  == characteristics of streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitior from infected dental root canals.
AB  == morphological and physiological characteristics of 103 streptococcal isolates obtained from positive routine cultures of material from dental root canals at filling, were studied. the majority of the isolates were those which at a primary identification not fullfilled the criteria of enterococci, strep. sanguis, strep. mutans or strep. salivarius. only a few representative strains of the latter types were included in the study as a control of the method. the resemblance of the 103 isolates to 38 reference strains were assessed with numerical methods. the isolates formed 9 clusters with reference strains occurring in all but one. of the isolates which it was intended to identify and characterize with numerical taxonomic analysis, all but one joined one of 3 clusters and were identified as strep. milleri or strep. mitior (mitis). the most useful cultural characteristics to dfferentiate the two species were growth on the sulphonamide containing mc-agar and 7.5% bile blood agar by strep. milleri and production of hydrogen peroxide by strep. mitior. the characteristics of the strains in the nine 80-phenons are given in table 2. other characteristics that appeared to be of interest for differentiating strep. milleri from strep. mitior and these two species from other viridans streptococci are underlined in table 2. strep. milleri seems not earlier to have been reported to occur in infected root canals. the occurrence of strep. milleri is in agreement with the data given on serological groups found among streptococcal isolates from routine root canal cultures. little is known about the occurrence and distribution of strep. milleri in the human oral cavity, which therefore warrant further investigations.

AB  == small samples were taken from the first drop of saliva entering an operation field for root canal treatment isolated by rubber dam, which was intentionally leaky. the samples were primarly cultured in tas- and blh-medium and on ms-agar aerobically. the culture media were inoculated directly and via transport medium  (vmg iii). the cultures were analysed for strep. salivarius, strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis" after subculture on ms-agar as soon as visible growth had appeared in the broth media and again after a further 2 days. the following observations were made: 1. strep. salivarius was almost regularly found in either or both of tas- and blh-medium at primary culture of the samples contaminated with saliva. the result was the same whether these broth media were inoculated directly or via vmg iii. 2. strep. salivarius was always found in mixed cultures  and was nearly always accompanied by strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis". 3. strep. salivarius as well as strep. sanguis survived two days after visible growth significantly more oftern in blh-medium than in tas-medium. the findings lend support to the hypothesis based on clinical studies that when present in root canal cultures strep. salivarius is ascribable to contamination with saliva.

TI  == bacteriocin production and susceptibility among strains of streptococcus mutans grown in the presence of sucrose.
AB  == whereas the bacteriocin activity of eight strains of streptococcus mutans was unaffected by growth in the presence of sucrose, such a medium rendered five s. mutans and one s. salivarius indicator strains unsusceptible to the bacteriocins. in contrast, the susceptibility of three s. faecalis and one s. pyogenes strains  was unaltered when these indicators were grown in the presence of sucrose. since  the s. mutans and s. salivarius strains produced extracellular polysaccharides from sucrose whereas the s. faecalis and s. pyogenes strains did not, it was concluded that a coating of extracellular polysaccharides rendered normally susceptible organisms unsusceptible to bacteriocin action. this supports previous suggestions that such bacteriocins are not active in vivo and therefore play no role in regulating the microbial ecology in dental plaque.

AB  == the ability of streptococcus strains to adhere to the tooth surface in vitro was  investigated. polished enamel slabs, with and without acquired pellicles, were incubated with buffer suspensions of oral streptococci, and attached bacteria were counted under a microscope using incident light. low numbers of bacteria adhered to uncoated enamel; the presence of an acquired pellicle significantly enhanced the attachment of all strains tested. the adherence of streptococcus sanguis was significantly greater than that of streptococcus salivarius, and both of these strains adhered in greater numbers than did streptococcus mutans. when bacteria were suspended in whole saliva, the adherence of s. salivarius and s. mutans was inhibited, whereas the adherence of s. sanguis was enhanced in some experiments and inhibited in others. the adherence of s. sanguis and s. salivarius was consistently inhibited by parotid fluid; this inhibitory effect persisted after thorough washing and resonication of the bacterial cells. incubation in oral fluids was associated with the attachment of bacterial clumps  to the pellicle, and parallel investigation revealed agglutination of s. sanguis  and s. salivarius by whole saliva and, in particular, parotid fluid. the results  are discussed in terms of surface microecology, and are related to the development of dental plaque.

AB  == a group of streptococci possessing the characteristics of streptococcus miteor (s. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. these organisms averaged from 76 to 89% of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically  incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. they averaged 34, 40, and 18% of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on  the tongue dorsum, respectively. their ability to adhere to oral surfaces was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of s. miteor, s. salivarius, and s. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. samples of oral surfaces taken 1 hr later indicated s. miteor adhered far better than the other streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but s. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. glucose-grown cells of s. mutans adhered feebly to all oral surfaces studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. cells of s. miteor and s. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. electron microscopy of cells of s. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated  that the organisms possessed a fibrillar "fuzzy" coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. this "fuzzy" coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius.

AB  == the present study describes the distribution of veillonella and neisseria species in the human oral cavity and indicates that their ability to attach to oral surfaces correlates with their proportions found in various sites of the mouth. the mean percentages of veillonella and neisseria of the total flora cultivable on anaerobic blood-agar plates was found to be: plaque, 0.75 and <0.13, respectively; lip, 0.38 and <0.05; cheek, 0.66 and <0.14; tongue dorsum, 9.4 and  <0.12; saliva, 5.0 and <0.9. the ability of veillonella and neisseria species to  attach to tooth surfaces was studied by cleaning the labial surfaces of incisors  to render them relatively free of viable bacteria. samples taken 1 hr later contained <0.27% veillonella and <0.4% neisseria, whereas saliva to which these teeth were exposed contained 20-fold higher proportions of veillonella. these data indicate that veillonella and neisseria species possess a feeble ability to  attach to cleaned teeth. the ability of these organisms to adhere to other oral surfaces was determined by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of volunteers for 5 min. labeled strains of streptococcus sanguis and s. salivarius were included for comparative purposes. analysis of samples obtained from oral surfaces after 45 min indicated that veillonella and neisseria adhere very poorly to preformed dental plaque as compared to s. sanguis. in contrast, veillonella adhered to the tongue dorsum markedly better than neisseria, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius. the greater ability of veillonella to adhere to the tongue in relation to the other organisms studied correlates with the high proportions of veillonella found on this site. the feeble ability of neisseria to attach to surfaces in the oral cavity is reflected by their low proportions found on these surfaces.

TI  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == serum bacteriostasis of staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. four of six different strains, including the propagating s. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. all six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. in contrast to sensitive s. aureus, s. epidermidis and streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella montevideo, s. zymogenes, and diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. among gram-positive bacteria, only d. pneumoniae inhibited s. aureus bacteriostasis. agglutinins of s. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, c-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for s. aureus serum bacteriostasis. after diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins a, g, and m appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. it is suggested that s. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions  with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.

TI  == selective bacterial adherence to oral epithelial surfaces and its role as an ecological determinant.
AB  == the possible relationship between the ability of streptococcus species to adhere  to oral epithelial cells and their natural distribution on epithelial surfaces within the mouth was studied. strains of s. salivarius and s. sanguis, which are  present in significant proportions on oral epithelial surfaces, were found to possess a definite capacity to adhere to epithelial cells obtained from cheek scrapings of humans, hamsters, and germ-free rats. in contrast, strains of s. mutans, which are found in only minor proportions, if at all, on oral epithelial  surfaces exhibited feeble or no adherence to oral epithelial cells. s. salivarius cells attached well to human cheek cells over the range of ph 5 to 8. its adherence was not found to be markedly influenced by saliva or by growth in sucrose broth. several other types of bacteria were examined which also exhibited widely different abilities to attach to human cheek cells. mixtures of streptomycin-labeled strains were introduced into the mouths of volunteers for study of the adherence of streptococcus species to oral epithelial surfaces in vivo. labeled s. salivarius and s. sanguis were recovered in high proportions from cheek and tongue surfaces, whereas the proportions of labeled s. mutans recovered from these surfaces were low in comparison to the original mixture. these data indicate that a correlation exists between the relative adherence of various streptococcus species and their proportional distribution found naturally on oral epithelial surfaces. the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is proposed as a critical ecological determinant affecting their colonization in environments with open surfaces exposed to bathing fluids.

TI  == laboratory studies with a selective enterococcus medium.
AB  == lancefield group d streptococci are involved with appreciable frequency in a variety of infectious processes. the presumptive recognition of these bacteria on initial culturing of clinical specimens is an objective not attained readily by selective media available in the clinical laboratory. selective enterococcus agar was evaluated with emphasis on its ability to sequester enterococci from specimens with many microbial components. in addition, the sensitivity of this new agar was compared with trypticase soy agar containing sheep blood and mitis salivarius agar. all enterococci isolated from clinical material were classified  in accordance with accepted biochemical and immunochemical criteria. the enterococci grew on the new medium as distinctive colonies surrounded by a black  zone. only listeria monocytogenes presented similar colonial morphology after 48  hr. most other bacteria did not grow at all or appeared markedly different. the sensitivity of the new agar was of the same order of magnitude as on blood or mitis-salivarius agars, but its selectivity was superior.

TI  == use of a methylene blue azide medium for isolation of enterococci.
AB  == a methylene blue azide medium (mba), developed by schaedler, dubos, and costello  to isolate enterococci from the gastrointestinal tract of animals, was evaluated. this was done by comparing the isolation of enterococci from feces and saliva on  the medium. fifty-two catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci from human feces isolated from mba were classified as enterococci. all strains grew in s f, 6.5% nacl, and streptomycin broths, and all fermented mannitol. the isolates were provisionally subdivided into streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium groups. s. faecalis-like strains fermented glycerol and pyruvate aerobically and produced acid in snyder's medium (initial ph, 4.8). the s. faecium group fermented raffinose. among all strains, several tests were variable. these included growth  at 45 c, in 0.1% tellurite and in methylene blue milk. three methods were employed to isolate and identify enterococci from the oral cavity. direct streaking of mba with saliva failed to produce any growth on the medium. two other methods, with the use of various selective broths to promote the recovery of oral enterococci, failed to produce any bacteria capable of growing on mba. the mba-isolated fecal strains and oral viridans streptococci were generally indistinguishable on mitis-salivarius and k f agars. in experiments with fecal material, no gram-negative bacilli were found among the isolates selected. the mba medium was judged as a high selectivity-low yield medium, and may provide a means of separating fecal and nonfecal enterococci.

TI  == factors influencing the occurrence of high numbers of iodine-resistant bacteria in iodinated swimming pools.
AB  == it has been shown that, although iodinated swimming-pool waters are usually free  from coliform bacteria and enterococci, the total counts frequently become relatively high. pseudomonas alcaligenes and alcaligenes faecalis have been shown to account for most of these high counts. it was of interest, therefore, to compare the microbial flora of four alternately chlorinated and iodinated swimming pools. by means of the membrane filter method and suitable selective media, examinations were made for total viable counts, coliform bacteria, enterococci, staphylococci, streptococcus salivarius, and p. aeruginosa. colonies also were picked from membrane filters incubated on standard plate count agar and identified. the results showed that, although viable counts were significantly higher during the iodinated periods, the specific types of bacteria determined were either fewer than or the same as in chlorinated periods. during chlorination, the predominant microbial flora consisted of staphylococci and members of the genus bacillus. during iodination, however, the p. alcaligenes-a.  faecalis group accounted for 92 to 99% of the microbial flora. the accumulation of high numbers of these bacteria was shown to be due to their iodine resistance  and their ability to grow rapidly in pool water in the absence of free iodine.

TI  == transformation reactions between pneumococcus and three strains of streptococci.
AB  == reciprocal transformation reactions to streptomycin resistance have been demonstrated between pneumococcus and 2 strains of viridans streptococci, which by the usual bacteriological criteria are distantly related to pneumococcus. desoxyribonucleic acid (dna) extracts of a strain of streptomycin-resistant streptococcus salivarius have been found capable of transforming pneumococcus and two strains of viridans streptococci but the strain itself was not transformed by autologous or heterologous dna extracts. the two strains of viridans streptococci were more efficient than pneumococcus as receptors of both autologous and heterologous transforming principles. it is inferred, therefore, that efficiency  of transformation does not necessarily indicate closeness of relationship among bacteria. the efficiency of transforming principles (tp's) from three streptococcal strains to induce streptomycin resistance in pneumococcus increased following their reduplication in pneumococcus. at the same time the efficiency of two of these tp's to transform streptococcus was reduced. resistance to optochin  (ethylhydrocupreine), a characteristic of most streptococci, can be transferred to pneumococcus, a naturally susceptible species, by transformation reactions.

TI  == a serological classification of viridans streptococci with special reference to those isolated from subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  == a total of 108 strains of viridans streptococci from subacute bacterial endocarditis, and 99 strains from human throats and extracted teeth have been studied, and approximately two-thirds of all the strains so far have been differentiated into a number of serological groups. the similarity between strains from these sources is evident from the fact that approximately 50 per cent of the reacting strains from each source fall into two groups i and ii, and  that three groups i, ii, and iv, contain streptococci from both sources in approximately the same distribution. fifteen vaginal strains of viridians streptococci failed, with the exception of one strain, to react with groups i-iv  of the endocarditis serums. more than three-fourths of the strains from both sources were streptococcus salivarius as determined by sherman's criteria. however, no correlation between the biochemical and serological classification could be made. it may be concluded that the viridans streptococci are amenable to classification by serological methods. the results so far obtained do not indicate a serological difference between strains of viridans streptococci isolated from subacute bacterial endocarditis, and those isolated from human throats and extracted teeth. the greater definitive value of serological methods  in the identification of a particular strain is indicated.
