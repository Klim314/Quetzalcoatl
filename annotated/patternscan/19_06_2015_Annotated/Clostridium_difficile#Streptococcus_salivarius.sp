TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == probiotic therapy of intestinal inflammation and infections.
AB  == purpose of review: the author presents evidence published during the past year regarding treatment of clinical and experimental intestinal inflammation and infections by probiotic agents. recent findings: normal commensal bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic, immune-mediated intestinal inflammation, particularly crohn disease and pouchitis, whereas viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan infections are increasingly important with widespread use of immunosuppressive agents and broad-spectrum antibiotics. combinations of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus salivarius prevent relapse of recurrent pouchitis and perhaps decrease the initial onset of pouch inflammation, whereas escherichia coli nissle 1917 maintains remission in ulcerative colitis. several agents offer promise as primary therapy of ulcerative colitis. use of probiotics in crohn disease remains unsubstantiated. animal models demonstrate marked differences in responses among various probiotic bacterial species and that nonviable organisms can have therapeutic efficacy. probiotics have multiple  mechanisms of action, including prevention of pathogenic bacterial growth, binding to or penetration of pathogens to mucosal surfaces, stimulation of mucosal barrier function, or altering immunoregulation (decreasing proinflammatory and promoting protective molecules). although multiple probiotic  species block epithelial adhesion and invasion by microbial pathogens in vitro, their proven utility in clinical infections is limited to accelerating recovery from acute infectious diarrhea and preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. summary: probiotics offer promise for physiologic, nontoxic treatment of pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and acute infectious diarrhea, but larger, controlled clinical studies must be performed to clarify optimal agents; doses; combinations of various probiotics, prebiotics, and antibiotics; and therapeutic  conditions.

TI  == identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 32 healthy korean infants was measured. the ability  to show similar activity against escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. twelve of the 109 lab showed activity against c. difficile and 19 strains were active against e. coli o157:h7, but none against s. aureus. four strains had antimicrobial activity against both c. difficile and e.  coli o157:h7. of the 12 strains that had activity against c. difficile, four strains were excluded as streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species. based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.

TI  == definition of a fundamental repeating unit in streptococcal glucosyltransferase glucan-binding regions and related sequences.
AB  == the c-termini of the glucosyltransferases (gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. these glucan-binding domains (gbds) are composed  of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (a-d) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. in contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. according to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. analysis of the gbds of the gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "yg" repeat, could be discerned within the "a", "b", "c", and "d"  repeats. similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the pspa protein of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. analysis of the "yg" repeats present in the gtfj and gtfk of streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "yg" repeats in the gbds of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "yg" repeats.

TI  == the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract.
AB  == the development of the bacterial flora of neonates with congenital abnormalities  of the gastro-intestinal tract was studied in 31 infants during the first 10 days of life. specimens were collected from the umbilicus, mouth and gastro-intestinal tract on the pre-operative day, at operation and on post-operative days 1, 2, 3,  5, 7 and 10. bacteria were isolated semi-quantitatively on a variety of plain and selective media and identified by conventional methods.staphylococcus albus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was recovered from 24 of  the 31 babies. the viridans group of streptococci and streptococcus salivarius were the commonest species isolated from the mouth; there were no differences between the babies with different abnormalities and treatment with antibiotics had no effect on the bacterial flora. ten babies were colonized by each species on the pre-operative day, and 25 and 19 respectively by the tenth post-operative  day. anaerobic gram-positive cocci were the predominant oral anaerobes. bacteria  were not isolated from the rectal swabs of babies with tracheo-oesophageal fistula (tof) or small bowel atresia on the pre-operative days. post-operatively  the predominant faecal isolates from babies with tof were str. faecalis, escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens. about 80% of the babies with small  bowel atresia were colonized by str. faecalis and bacteroides vulgatus, 60% each  by e. coli, klebsiella aerogenes and str. faecium. the five babies with necrotizing enterocolitis were colonized by str. faecalis, e. coli, cl. perfringens and cl. difficile; bacteroides spp. were not recovered from any of them. the commonest facultative species recovered from babies with large bowel obstruction were str. faecalis and e. coli. b. vulgatus, cl. perfringens and bifidobacterium spp. were the commonest anaerobes and anaerobes outnumbered aerobes. no significant isolates were recovered from the wound swabs and none of  the babies developed post-surgical sepsis.
