TI  - Polysaccharide from seeds of Plantago asiatica L. affects lipid metabolism and colon microbiota of mouse.
AB  - Polysaccharide from the seeds of Plantago asiatica L. was given via oral administration to mice (0.4 g/kg body weight, 30 days) to observe its effects on mouse nutrient metabolism and colon microbiota. It was found the polysaccharide intake could lower the apparent absorption of lipid. Total triglyceride, cholesterol, and atherogenic index in blood serum with total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver of polysaccharide group mice were all significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the effect of the polysaccharide intake on mouse colon bacterial communities was investigated. Mice from the polysaccharide group showed a higher colon bacterial diversity than the control group. Bacteroides sp., Eubacterium sp., butyrate-producing bacteria Butyrivibrio sp., and probiotics Bifidobacterium bifidum , Lactobacillus fermentum , and Lactobacillus reuteri in mouse colon were all increased after polysaccharide intake. These indicated that the intake of polysaccharide from P. asiatica L. could be beneficial for lipid metabolism and colon microbiota.
TI  - The beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The structure of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. RESULTS: The strain named Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (EPS) yield was selected to study the effect of its EPS on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. The results indicated that EPS significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis indicated that the EPS significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. When receiving a low dose of EPS, Bacteroidales sp./Lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and L. johnsonii, L. animalis and L. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a high concentration of EPS. CONCLUSION: The combination of viable cell count, DGGE and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of EPS from B. bifidum WBIN03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health of their hosts.
