TI  == nature of the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus caseibifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis against foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities as well as the nature of the inhibitory compounds obtained from lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis strains were assayed on foodborne pathogenic - staphyloccoccus aureus subsp. aureus (ccug atcc(r) 25926) and escherichia coli (atcc(r) 25922) - and spoilage microorganisms - pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc(r) 27853). test producer strains showed inhibitory effect on all indicator microorganisms in diffusion of  cell-free concentrated supernatant by agar in well methods (10.0-22.5 mm) in periods of 24, 48 and 72 h. inhibitory compounds showed no sensitivity to the action of proteolytic enzyme trypsin and were completely inactivated by adjusting the ph of the cell-free 20 x concentrated supernatant to 7.0. the results demonstrated that antimicrobial substances do not have proteinaceous nature and are caused by the action of organic acids with decreasing medium ph.

TI  == oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. improves insulin resistance, induces  adiponectin, and prevents inflammatory adipokine expressions.
AB  == the intestinal microbiome might be an important contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes. this study was designed to test the hypothesis that oral administration of bifidobacterium species (spp.) (including b. longum, b. bifidum, b. infantis, and b. animalis) may both ameliorate insulin resistance and reduce the expressions of inflammatory adipocytokines. male swiss-webster mice fed a high-fat diet with or without oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. for 5 weeks were subjected to an insulin tolerance test and an oral glucose tolerance test. plasma levels of glucose at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after insulin  injection or glucose administration were significantly lower in the bifidobacterium spp. than in the control group (p < 0.05), showing the beneficial effect of oral administration on insulin resistance in obese swiss mice. in addition, bifidobacterium spp. increased the adiponectin mrna level and decreased those of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 6 in non-diabetic c57bl/6j mice fed a normal diet, indicating a molecular mechanism which may ameliorate the inflammatory state, thereby reducing insulin resistance. in conclusion, oral administration of bifidobacterium spp. improves insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in obese mice by reducing inflammation, as it does in the lean state.

TI  == mupirocin-mucin agar for selective enumeration of bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is a bacterial species exclusively found in the human intestinal tract. this species is becoming increasingly popular as a probiotic organism added to lyophilized products. in this study, porcine mucin was used as  the sole carbon source for the selective enumeration of b. bifidum in probiotic food additives. thirty-six bifidobacterial strains were cultivated in broth with  mucin. only 13 strains of b. bifidum utilized the mucin to produce acids. b. bifidum was selectively enumerated in eight probiotic food supplements using agar (mm agar) containing mupirocin (100 mg/l) and mucin (20 g/l) as the sole carbon source. mm agar was fully selective if the b. bifidum species was presented together with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, bifidobacterium breve, and  bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum species and with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli, streptococci). isolated strains of b. bifidum were identified using biochemical, pcr, maldi-tof procedures and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the novel selective medium was also suitable for the isolation of b. bifidum strains  from human fecal samples.

TI  == bifidobacteria supplementation: effects on plasma lipid profiles in dyslipidemic  children.
AB  == objective: preclinical investigations support the use of probiotics in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, but clinical evidence is often contrasting. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic formulation containing three bifidobacterium strains on lipid profiles in children affected by primary dyslipidemia. methods: thirty-eight children with dyslipidemia, ages 10.8 +/- 2.1 y, were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. after a 4-wk diet run-in period, the children received probiotics (b. animalis subspecies lactis mb 2409, b. bifidum mb 109b, and b. longum subspecies longum bl04) or placebo for 3 mo. after 1 mo, wash-out treatments were switched. a strict dietary evaluation concerning satured fatty acids and cholesterol content, step i diet accordingly, was performed by a dietitian who examined the weekly dietary diary at each visit. results: baseline  lipid profile was (mean +/- sd): total cholesterol (tc) 222.8 +/- 23.2 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c) 55.8 +/- 12.2 mg/dl, triglycerides (tg) 99.0 +/- 61.7 mg/dl, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) 147.2 +/- 21.9 mg/dl. after 3 mo of probiotic treatment, the lipid profile was: tc 211.9 +/- 27.3 mg/dl, hdl-c 60.7 +/- 14.2 mg/dl, tg 79.5 +/- 34.5 mg/dl, and ldl-c 135.3 +/- 24.2 mg/dl. compared with placebo, probiotics reduced tc by 3.4%  (p = 0.02) and ldl-c by 3.8% (p = 0.001). no significant dietary change occurred  through the study and no relevant adverse effects were observed. conclusions: treatment with a bifidobacterium probiotic formulation was well tolerated and useful in combination with to diet therapy. children with dyslipidemia benefited  from this approach, although the results need to be confirmed by larger controlled studies.

TI  == probiotics in the prevention of eczema: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to evaluate a multistrain, high-dose probiotic in the prevention of eczema. design: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial. settings: antenatal clinics, research clinic, children at home. patients:  pregnant women and their infants. interventions: women from 36 weeks gestation and their infants to age 6 months received daily either the probiotic (lactobacillus salivarius cul61, lactobacillus paracasei cul08, bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium bifidum cul20; total of 10(10) organisms/day) or matching placebo. main outcome measure: diagnosed eczema at age 2 years. infants were followed up by questionnaire. clinical examination and skin prick tests to common allergens were done at 6 months and 2 years. results: the cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at 2 years was similar in the probiotic (73/214, 34.1%) and placebo arms (72/222, 32.4%; or 1.07, 95% ci 0.72 to 1.6). among the secondary outcomes, the cumulative frequency of skin prick sensitivity at 2 years was reduced in the probiotic (18/171; 10.5%) compared with the placebo arm (32/173; 18.5%; or 0.52, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.98). the  statistically significant differences between the arms were mainly in sensitisation to cow's milk and hen's egg proteins at 6 months. atopic eczema occurred in 9/171 (5.3%) children in the probiotic arm and 21/173 (12.1%) in the  placebo arm (or 0.40, 95% ci 0.18 to 0.91). conclusions: the study did not provide evidence that the probiotic either prevented eczema during the study or reduced its severity. however, the probiotic seemed to prevent atopic sensitisation to common food allergens and so reduce the incidence of atopic eczema in early childhood. trial registration number: isrctn26287422.

TI  == hydrolysis of milk gangliosides by infant-gut associated bifidobacteria determined by microfluidic chips and high-resolution mass spectrometry.
AB  == gangliosides are receiving considerable attention because they participate in diverse biological processes. milk gangliosides appear to block pathogen adhesion and modify the intestinal ecology of newborns. however, the interaction of milk gangliosides with gut bifidobacteria has been little investigated. the digestion  products of a mixture of gangliosides isolated from milk following incubation with six strains of bifidobacteria were studied using nanohplc chip q-tof ms. to  understand ganglioside catabolism in vitro, the two major milk gangliosides--gm3  and gd3--remaining in the media after incubation with bifidobacteria were quantified. individual gangliosides were identified through postprocessing precursor ion scans, and quantitated with the "find by molecular feature" algorithm of masshunter qualitative analysis software. bifidobacterium infantis and b. bifidum substantially degraded the gm3 and gd3, whereas b. longum subsp. longum and b. animalis subsp. lactis only showed moderate degradation. maldi fticr ms analysis enabled a deeper investigation of the degradation and identified ganglioside degradation specifically at the outer portions of the glycan molecules. these results indicate that certain infant gut-associated bifidobacteria have the ability to degrade milk gangliosides releasing sialic acid, and that these glycolipids could play a prebiotic role in the infant gut.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == the beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  == background: the structure of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a  few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. results: the strain named bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03  with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (eps) yield was selected to study the effect of its eps on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. the results indicated that eps significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis indicated that the eps significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. when receiving a low dose of eps, bacteroidales sp./lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and l. johnsonii, l. animalis and l. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a  high concentration of eps. conclusion: the combination of viable cell count, dgge and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity  in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of eps from b. bifidum wbin03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health  of their hosts.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharides and inflammatory cytokines: an in vitro study using a human colonic microbiota model.
AB  == gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (lps) are critical to the development and progression of chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic diseases. in this study, the effects of probiotics lactobacillus and bifidobacterium on gut-derived lipopolysaccharide and inflammatory cytokine concentrations were evaluated using  a human colonic microbiota model. lactobacillus reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. longum subsp.  infantis were identified from the literature for their anti-inflammatory potential. each bacterial culture was administered daily to a human colonic microbiota model during 14 days. colonic lipopolysaccharides, and gram-positive and negative bacteria were quantified. raw 264.7 macrophage cells were stimulated with supernatant from the human colonic microbiota model. concentrations of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-4 cytokines were measured. lipopolysaccharide concentrations were significantly reduced with the administration of b. bifidum (-46.45 +/- 5.65%), l. rhamnosus (-30.40 +/- 5.08%), b. longum (-42.50 +/- 1.28%), and b. longum subsp. infantis (-68.85 +/- 5.32%) (p < 0.05). cell counts  of gram-negative and positive bacteria were distinctly affected by the probiotic  administered. there was a probiotic strain-specific effect on immunomodulatory responses of raw 264.7 macrophage cells. b. longum subsp. infantis demonstrated higher capacities to reduce tnf-alpha concentrations (-69.41 +/- 2.78%; p < 0.05) and to increase il-4 concentrations (+16.50 +/- 0.59%; p < 0.05). colonic lipopolysaccharides were significantly correlated with tnf-alpha and il-1beta concentrations (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that specific probiotic bacteria, such as b. longum subsp. infantis, might decrease colonic lipopolysaccharide concentrations, which might reduce the proinflammatory tone. this study has noteworthy applications in the field of biotherapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory and metabolic diseases.

TI  == identification of the beta-glucosidase gene from bifidobacterium animalis subsp.  lactis and its expression in b. bifidum bgn4.
AB  == beta-glucosidase is necessary for the bioconversion of glycosidic phytochemicals  in food. two bifidobacterium strains (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis sh5  and b. animalis subsp. lactis rd68) with relatively high beta- glucosidase activities were selected among 46 lactic acid bacteria. a beta-glucosidase gene (bbg572) from b. lactis was shotgun cloned, fully sequenced, and analyzed for its transcription start site, structural gene, and deduced transcriptional terminator. the structural gene of bbg572 was 1,383 bp. based on amino sequence similarities, bbg572 was assigned to family 1 of the glycosyl hydrolases. to overexpress bbg572 in bifidobacterium, several bifidobacteria expression vectors  were constructed by combining several promoters and a terminator sequence from different bifidobacteria. the maximum activity of recombinant bbg572 was achieved when it was expressed under its own promoter and terminator. its enzyme activity  increased 31-fold compared with those of its parental strains. the optimal ph for bbg572 was ph 6.0. bbg572 was stable at 37-40 degrees c. it hydrolyzed isoflavones, quercetins, and disaccharides with various beta-glucoside linkages.  bbg572 also converted the ginsenosides rb1 and rb2. these results suggest that this new beta-glucosidase-positive bifidobacterium transformant can be utilized for the production of specific aglycone products.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == short communication: identification and differentiation of bifidobacteria obtained from ukraine.
AB  == ten freeze-dried bifidobacterial strains used as probiotics in ukrainian dairy foods, identified by the supplier as bifidobacterium adolescentis (2), bifidobacterium bifidum (2), bifidobacterium longum (4), bifidobacterium animalis (1), and bifidobacterium infantis (1), were characterized. following rehydration  and anaerobic growth on de man, rogosa, and sharpe-cysteine medium at 37 degrees  c for 72 h, single-colony isolates were picked and evaluated using pcr primers specific for the bifidobacterium genus, for the supplier-identified species, and  for b. animalis ssp. lactis. all isolates were identified as members of the genus bifidobacterium; however, species-specific pcr revealed all 10 isolates were actually strains of b. animalis ssp. lactis. further evaluation using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was only able to separate a single strain (rt 09) from the other 9 strains evaluated. application of genome-wide allelic profiling to the ukrainian bifidobacterial strains revealed 4 distinct groups. interestingly, 6 (60%) of the isolates fell into the same cluster as that containing the common commercial probiotic strain bb-12. two of the strains (rt 02 and rt 09) were found to be in the same group as atcc 27536 and one strain (rt 08) was in the same group as the rb 7239 (a previously evaluated commercial strain). one strain, rt 04, was placed on a unique branch. these results highlight the importance of employing routine typing of bifidobacterial isolates, demonstrate the utility of single nucleotide polymorphism/insertion-deletion polymorphism-based allelic typing in b. animalis ssp. lactis strain differentiation and further point to the limited genetic variability of b. animalis ssp. lactis strains and the worldwide distribution of a small number of  commercial strains.

TI  == genetic analysis and morphological identification of pilus-like structures in members of the genus bifidobacterium.
AB  == background: cell surface pili in gram positive bacteria have been reported to orchestrate the colonization of host tissues, evasion of immunity and the development of biofilms. so far, little if any information is available on the presence of pilus-like structures in human gut commensals like bifidobacteria. results and discussion: in this report, atomic force microscopy (afm) of various  bifidobacterial strains belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis revealed the existence of appendages resembling pilus-like structures. interestingly, these microorganisms harbour two to six predicted pilus gene clusters in their genome, with each organized in an operon encompassing the major pilin subunit-encoding gene (designated fima or fimp) together with one or two minor pilin subunit-encoding genes (designated as  fimb and/or fimq), and a gene encoding a sortase enzyme (stra). quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr analysis and rt-pcr experiments revealed a polycistronic mrna, encompassing the fima/p and fimb/q genes, which are differentially expressed upon cultivation of bifidobacteria on various glycans.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == dietary supplementation with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria is well tolerated and not associated with adverse events during late pregnancy and early infancy.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are increasingly being administered to pregnant women and infants with the intention of improving health. although these organisms have a long record of safe use, it is important to identify any adverse effects in potentially vulnerable populations. in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we evaluated the safety of a bacterial dietary supplement for the prevention of atopy in infants. two strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus salivarius cul61 and lactobacillus paracasei cul08) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis cul34 and bifidobacterium  bifidum cul20) with a total of 1 x 10(10) colony-forming units were administered  daily to women during the last month of pregnancy and to infants aged 0-6 mo. adverse events (ae) were classified according to who international statistical classification of diseases criteria. common symptoms were recorded by regular questionnaires. baseline characteristics of 220 mother-infant dyads in the treatment and 234 in the placebo group were similar. compliance with the trial interventions, loss to follow-up, symptoms, drug usage, infant growth, method of  feeding, visits to the doctor, and mothers' assessment of infant health were similar in the 2 groups. fifteen (6.8%) mothers and 73 (33.2%) infants in the treatment group and 21 (9.0%) mothers and 75 (32.1%) infants in the placebo group reported ae (p = 0.49 and p = 0.84, respectively). severe ae occurred in 18 mothers and 63 infants with a similar frequency in each group. none of the ae were attributed to the intervention. our findings support the safe use of this consortium of organisms during pregnancy and early infancy.

AB  == in this work we evaluated the specific immune activation properties of different  bifidobacterium strains, some of the most relevant intestinal microorganisms. to  this end, we examined the in vitro effect of 12 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 4 different species, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, on the maturation pattern of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs), as well as in their ability to induce cytokine secretion. in addition, we determined peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) proliferation and cytokine expression after exposure to bacterial strains. all bifidobacteria tested were able to induce full dc maturation but showed differences in the levels of cytokine production, especially il-12, il-10, tnfalpha and il-1beta, suggesting that specific cytokine ratios could be used to predict the type of th response that they may promote. in fact, analysis of cytokine production by pbmc showed that most of the tested b. animalis and b. longum strains induced the secretion of large amounts of ifngamma and tnfalpha, in agreement with the th1 profile suggested by dc cytokine production. remarkably, three of four b. bifidum strains induced poor secretion of these cytokines and significant amounts of il-17, the main product of th17 cells, in accordance with the high il-1beta/il-12 ratio observed after dc stimulation. in conclusion, this work shows species and strain-specific immune effects of bifidobacteria and describes a valuable method for screening possible  probiotic strains with different immunomodulatory properties. notably, some b. bifidum strains seem to promote th17 polarization, which could be useful for future probiotic applications.

TI  == species delineation and clonal diversity in four bifidobacterium species as revealed by multilocus sequencing.
AB  == the genus bifidobacterium comprises several species that are important contributors to the gut microbiome, with some strains having beneficial health effects. understanding the evolutionary emergence of advantageous biological properties requires knowledge of the genetic diversity and clonal structure of species. we sequenced seven housekeeping genes in 119 bifidobacterium strains of  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences delineated sequence clusters that correspond to previously named taxa, and suggested that b. longum subsp. infantis is a nascent lineage emerging from within b. longum subsp. longum. clear traces of recombination among distant bifidobacterial species indicate leaky species borders and warn against the practice of single gene-based identification. multilocus sequence typing achieved precise strain genotyping, with discrimination indices above 99% in b. bifidum, b. breve and b. longum, providing a powerful tool for strain traceability, colonization dynamics and ecological studies. frequent homologous recombination accelerates clonal diversification and may facilitate the transfer of biological  properties among bifidobacterial strains.

TI  == bifidobacteria inhibit the inflammatory response induced by gliadins in intestinal epithelial cells via modifications of toxic peptide generation during  digestion.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is a chronic enteropathy triggered by intake of gliadin, the  toxic component of gluten. this study aims at evaluating the capacity of different bifidobacterium strains to counteract the inflammatory effects of gliadin-derived peptides in intestinal epithelial (caco-2) cells. a commercial extract of several gliadin (gld) types (alpha, beta, gamma, [symbol: see text] )  was subjected to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion (pepsin at ph 3, pancreatin-bile at ph 6), inoculated or not with cell suspensions (10(8) colony forming units/ml) of either b. animalis iata-a2, b. longum iata-es1, or b. bifidum iata-es2, in a bicameral system. the generated gliadin-derived peptides were identified by reverse phase-hplc-esi-ms/ms. caco-2 cell cultures were exposed to the different gliadin peptide digestions (0.25 mg protein/ml), and the mrna expression of nuclear factor kappa-b (nf-kappab), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and chemokine cxcr3 receptor were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) in stimulated cells. the production of the pro-inflammatory markers nf-kappab p50, tnf-alpha, and il-1beta (interleukine 1beta) by caco-2 cells was also determined  by elisa. the peptides from gliadin digestions inoculated with bifidobacteria did not exhibit the toxic amino acid sequences identified in those noninoculated (alpha/beta-gld [158-164] and alpha/beta-gld [122-141]). the rt-pcr analysis evidenced a down-regulation in mrna expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers. consistent with these results the production of nf-kappab, tnf-alpha, and il-1beta was reduced (18.2-22.4%, 28.0-64.8%, and abolished, respectively) in cell cultures exposed to gliadin digestions inoculated with bifidobacteria. therefore, bifidobacteria change the gliadin-derived peptide pattern and, thereby, attenuate their pro-inflammatory effects on caco-2 cells.

TI  == susceptibility of bifidobacteria to lysozyme as a possible selection criterion for probiotic bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == resistance or susceptibility of bifidobacteria to lysozyme and growth of bifidobacteria in human milk were tested. susceptible bifidobacterial strains stopped their growth almost immediately after the addition of lysozyme (400 microg/ml), moderately susceptible strains exhibited reduced growth rate, and growth curves of resistant strains were not affected. strains of human origin were more resistant to lysozyme than animal strains. while strains of b. bifidum  grew well in human milk samples, the growth b. animalis strains was inhibited after inoculation to human milk. the resistance to lysozyme seems to be a promising criterion for the selection of new probiotic bifidobacterial strains.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == comparison of in vitro models to study bacterial adhesion to the intestinal epithelium.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the adhesion ability of intestinal bacteria to different in vitro models of intestinal epithelia, and to estimate the suitability of these models and the type of interactions involved. methods and results: the adhesion of probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12), commensal (b. animalis iata-a2 and b. bifidum iata-es2) and potentially pathogenic bacteria (e. coli and l. monocytogenes) was determined. the adhesion models used were polycarbonate-well plates, with or without mucin, and different configurations of caco-2 and/or ht29-mtx cell cultures. all bacteria adhered to wells without mucin (2.6-27.3%), the values being highly variable depending on the bacterial strain. adhesion percentages of potentially probiotic bacteria to caco-2 cultures were remarkably lower (p < 0.05) than those to mucin, and more similar to those of pathogenic strains. the lowest adhesion of different bacterial strains was detected on ht29-mtx (0.5-2.3%) cultures and caco-2/ht29-mtx (0.6-3.2%) cocultures, while these values were increased in caco-2 cultures plus mucin. conclusions: the results suggested that bacterial strains exhibit different capacities to adhere to cellular components and several types of mucin present in different models, showing preferences for intestinal muc2. significance and impact of the study: the use of caco-2 cells monolayer plus mucin (type ii) better approaches the physiological characteristics of in vivo situation, providing a reliable and suitable in vitro model to evaluate bacterial adhesion.

TI  == [screening and identification of probiotic bifidobacterium from mongolian children].
AB  == objective: bifidobacterium has important physiological activity in gastrointestinal tract of human and animals, and the tolerability of acid, intestinal juice and oxgall bile salt are the key factors that influence the function of living bacteria preparation. in this study, feces of 12 healthy mongolian children were selected to isolate bifidobacterium with probiotic properties. methods: bifidobacterium was isolated from feces by selective medium  and identified by physiological biochemical test. the tolerability of acid, intestinal juice and oxgall bile salt of 11 bfidobacteria were studied and b. animalis v9 was identified further by molecular biological approach 16s rdna. results: eleven bifidobacteria isolated from feces of 12 healthy mongolian children were identified as b. adolescentis (a1, h3, g4, a8 and v10), b. longum (c6, c7 and d11), b. pseudocatenlatum (b2), b. bifidum (g5), b. animalis (v9). b. animalis v9 had the best acid tolerance with the survival rate 92.4% in artificial gastric juice at ph2.0 for 3h, whereas others had lower than 31.25%. b. animalis v9 also had good survival rate (99.7%) in artificial intestinal juice at ph8.0 for 8h after anaerobic cultured 3h in artificial gastric juice at ph2.0, and tolerated oxgall bile salt at concentration of 0.3%. b. animalis v9 was identified further by molecular biological approach 16s rdna and result showed the homologies of b. animalis v9 was 99% with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactic bb12. conclusion: b. animalis v9 had good probiotic properties to be potentiallyused in dairy products and health products.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == a bifidobacterium mixed-species microarray for high resolution discrimination between intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == a genomic dna-based microarray was constructed containing over 6000 randomly cloned genomic fragments of approximately 1-2 kb from six mammalian intestinal bifidobacterium spp. including b. adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, b. longum and b. pseudolongum. this bifidobacterium mixed-species (bms) microarray was used to differentiate between type strains and isolates belonging to a set of nine bifidobacterium spp. hierarchical clustering of genomic hybridization data confirmed the grouping of the bifidobacterium spp. according to the 16s rrna-based phylogenetic clusters. in addition, these genomic hybridization experiments revealed high homology between the type-strain b. animalis subsp. lactis lmg18314 and b. animalis subsp. animalis lmg10508 (79%) as well as between the type strains b. longum biotype longum lmg13197 and b. longum  biotype infantis lmg8811 (72%) - nevertheless, discrimination between these species was possible due to the high resolution output of the bms-array. in addition, it was shown that the bms-array could be used for assigning unknown bifidobacterium isolates to a species group. finally, a set of 54 diagnostic clones for bifidobacterium identification was selected and sequenced to advance the understanding of the species-related differences. remarkably, a large fraction (31%) of these was predicted to encode proteins that belong to the bifidobacterial glycobiome and another 11% had functional homology with genes involved in the protection against foreign dna. overall, the bms-microarray is a  high-resolution diagnostic tool that is able to facilitate the detection of strain- and species-specific characteristics of bifidobacteria.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == bifidobacterium microbiota and parameters of immune function in elderly subjects.
AB  == faecal and serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months from 55 institutionalized elderly subjects, who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. participants were randomized in one of the three treatment groups: intervention (two probiotic bifidobacterium longum strains: 2c  and 46), placebo and commercial control (bifidobacterium lactis bb-12). the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota was characterized by genus and species-specific pcr. serum levels of the cytokines il-10, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. each participant harboured on average approximately three different bifidobacterial species. the most frequently detected species were b. longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum. depending on the treatment, the intervention resulted in specific changes in the levels of certain bifidobacterium species, and positive correlations were found between the different species. negative correlations were observed between the levels of bifidobacterium species and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the regulatory cytokine il-10. the presence of faecal b. longum and bifidobacterium animalis correlated with reduced serum il-10. the anti-inflammatory tgf-beta1 levels were increased over time in all three groups, and the presence of bifidobacterium breve correlated with higher serum tgf-beta1 levels. this indicates that modulation of the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota may provide a  means of influencing inflammatory responses.

AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

AB  == the ability of five strains of different bifidobacterial species (bifidobacterium animalis, b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudolongum) isolated from human and animal gut to degrade myo-inositol hexaphosphate or phytic acid (insp(6)) has been evaluated. the disappearance of phytate and the generation of  lower myo-inositol phosphates were determined in a complex medium in which phytic acid was the only source of phosphorus. bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697 showed the highest level of phytate-degrading activity. this strain displayed optimal activity at slight acid ph (6.0-6.5) and 50 degrees c, but also retained  high activity levels at neutral ph and 37 degrees c. b. infantis atcc 15697 produced maximum activity during the stationary phase of growth and when 1% lactose was used as carbon source. in contrast, the presence of inorganic phosphate in the growth medium inhibited phytase activity. the ability of b. infantis atcc 15697 to generate lower myo-inositol phosphates and, particularly,  accumulate myo-inositol tri-phosphates (insp(3)) from partial hydrolysis of insp(6) could contribute to the reduction of the anti-nutritional properties of insp(6) and the generation of intermediate compounds with beneficial properties during food processing and gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bifidobacterium strains from humans, animals and  probiotic products.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial susceptibility  of a taxonomically diverse set of bifidobacterium strains to different classes of antimicrobial agents using a recently described medium. methods: the susceptibility of 100 strains encompassing 11 bifidobacterial species originating from humans, animals and probiotic products to 12 antimicrobial agents was tested by agar overlay disc diffusion. based on these results, one or two strains per species were selected for susceptibility testing to nine antibiotics by broth microdilution using the lactic acid bacteria susceptibility test medium (lsm) supplemented with cysteine. the genotypic basis of atypical tetracycline resistance was further characterized using pcr, southern blotting and partial sequencing. results: based on the distribution of inhibition zone diameters and mic values, all strains tested were susceptible to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol,  erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, rifampicin and vancomycin. our data also reinforce earlier observations indicating that bifidobacteria are intrinsically resistant to gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole and polymyxin b. susceptibility to trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, tetracycline and minocycline was variable. the tet(w) gene was responsible for tetracycline resistance in 15 strains including 7 probiotic isolates belonging to the taxa bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and bifidobacterium bifidum. this gene was present in a single copy on the chromosome and did not appear to be associated with the conjugative transposon tnb1230 previously found in tet(w)-containing butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. conclusions: the use of the lsm + cysteine medium allowed us to discriminate between intrinsic and atypical resistance properties of bifidobacteria and sets the scene for future definition  of epidemiological cut-off values for all important bifidobacterium species. the  presence of an acquired tet(w) gene in several probiotic product isolates stresses the need for a minimal safety evaluation during the selection of bifidobacterium strains for probiotic use.

TI  == bifidobacterium species isolated from animal feces and from beef and pork meat.
AB  == bifidobacteria were isolated from 122 of 145 samples of animal feces (from cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, chickens, geese, and pigeons) from  farms in france and austria and from 92 of 955 production and processing chain samples of beef and pork (obtained at slaughter, cutting, and retail). bacterial  strains were identified to species by phenotypic numerical classification based on api 50ch and id 32a tests and dna-dna hybridization. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was present in 81% (99 of 122 samples) of all bifidobacterium-positive fecal samples and predominated in samples from all animal species except those from swine from austria. in these austrian swine samples, the majority of strains were identified as bifidobacterium thermophilum  (78%), followed by b. pseudolongum (48%). the distribution of b. thermophilum and b. pseudolongum differed significantly between austrian swine and cattle samples  such as those collected along beef and pork production and processing chains. bifidobacterium animalis was isolated from swine feces, and bifidobacterium ruminantium was isolated from cow dung. six fecal isolates (from cattle, swine, rabbits, goats, and horses) were identified as belonging to bifidobacterium species of predominantly human origin: b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, and b. catenulatum. only one other species, bifidobacterium choerinum, was detected with low frequency in a pork processing chain. b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum was predominant in pig feces, whereas b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum was predominant in feces from other animal species. four strains closely related to both subspecies (58 to 61% dna reassociation) formed a distinct genomic group. pcr techniques, which are more rapid and sensitive than culture-based methods, could  be used to detect directly b. pseudolongum and b. thermophilum as indicators of fecal contamination along the meat processing chain.

TI  == culture-dependent and culture-independent qualitative analysis of probiotic products claimed to contain bifidobacteria.
AB  == a total of 58 probiotic products obtained worldwide, which were claimed to contain bifidobacterium strains (including 22 yoghurts, 5 dairy fruit drinks, 28  food supplements and 3 pharmaceutical preparations) were investigated in parallel using a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach. three isolation media previously reported as selective for bifidobacterium were evaluated for their suitability in the quality analysis of these products. subsequently, possible bifidobacterial colonies were picked from the best medium and identified by means of rep-pcr fingerprinting using the box primer (box-pcr). bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, formerly classified as bifidobacterium lactis, was most frequently found, but strains belonging to bifidobacterium longum biotypes longum and infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium  breve were recovered also. in parallel, all products were also subjected to culture-independent analysis which involved a nested-pcr step on total bacterial  dna extracted directly from the product, followed by separation of the amplicons  by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and subsequent identification of species from the band patterns. by conventional cultivation, 70.7% of the products analysed were found to contain culturable bifidobacteria whereas by culture-independent dgge analysis members of the genus bifidobacterium could be detected in 96.5% of the analysed products. genotypic characterization of a number of bifidobacterial isolates at the strain level by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed a relatively high degree of genomic homogeneity among the bifidobacterium strains currently used in the probiotic industry.

AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

TI  == relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in indigenous and exogenous bacteria.
AB  == aims: to investigate whether there is a relationship between interaction sites in the gut, hydrophobicity, mucosal immunomodulating capacities and cell wall protein profiles in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and enterococci. methods and results: hydrophobicity, cell wall protein profiles and sites of interaction in the gut (by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled bacteria) were determined for lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, b. animalis and enterococcus faecalis. we also determined the number of immunoglobulin (ig)a+, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha+, interleukin (il)-6+ and il-10+ cells after oral administration of the above bacteria to balb/c mice.  all strains assessed were found to interact with the sites of induction of the immune response in the gut. no correlation with hydrophobicity was observed. when some strains at certain doses were administered to mice, bacterial translocation  to liver was observed. the oral administration of indigenous (104 cells day(-1))  and exogenous (107 cells day(-1)) bifidobacteria and lactobacilli for 5 consecutive days activated the systemic and intestinal mucosal immune response in a strain-specific way, independently whether the strain was indigenous or exogenous in relation to the host. the differences in the immunopotentiating capacity of the various strains might be related to the differences in their cell wall protein profiles. conclusions: indigenous bacteria activated the mucosal immune response at a dose significantly smaller than the one required for probiotic exogenous bacteria. however, probiotic exogenous bacteria can be used at high concentrations in fermented dairy products with a great impact on the immune system, favouring its immunomodulation. significance and impact of the study: the immunomodulation capacity of probiotic bacteria is strain specific and independent of the specificity of the host. the ability of certain strains to down-regulate the production and release of il-6 by il-10 may have potential implications in their use in cases in which cytokine deregulation or excessive production at the mucosal level can be the cause of tissue damage.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == adhesion of bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == twenty-four bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. no significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. among the tested bacteria, b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of b. animalis and  b. lactis was not preferential. these results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.

TI  == characterization of bifidobacteria by random dna amplification.
AB  == rapd conditions were optimized to generate reproducible banding patterns by testing primers, thermocyclers and overall reproducibility in repeat dna analysis and separate dna extractions. five primers were chosen on the basis of band intensity and distribution (between 2 and 10 bands) which clearly distinguished among strains of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum. the use of five single-primer reactions under optimized conditions improved the resolution and accuracy of the rapd method for  the characterization of dairy-related bifidobacteria. the results indicated that  this method was highly reproducible in repeated analysis. similarity between bifidobacteria strains was evaluated based on their rapd profiles. using a set of five primers, it was demonstrated that it may be possible to distinguish three different species of bifidobacterium (b. breve, b. bifidum and b. adolescentis),  based on similarity of the rapd profiles to known reference strains. furthermore, application of the rapd technique may also be useful and faster, than traditional systematics for placement of industrial strains into specific clusters (either b. longum/infantis or b. animalis/lactis).

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of potentially probiotic bifidobacterium isolates from  the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == sixteen bifidobacterium isolates from the human gastrointestinal tract were assayed for susceptibility to 44 antibiotics by soft agar overlay disc diffusion  on tpy agar. five isolates (3/7 b. bifidum and 2/3 b. breve) exhibited atypical antibiotic susceptibility profiles. poor growth in the agar overlay accounted for susceptibility of b. bifidum but not b. breve isolates. all other isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (30 micrograms), aztreonam (30 micrograms), vancomycin (30 micrograms), amikacin (30 micrograms), gentamicin (10 micrograms), kanamycin (30  micrograms), streptomycin (10 micrograms), fusidic acid (10 micrograms), trimethoprim (5 micrograms), norfloxacin (10 micrograms), nalidixic acid (30 micrograms), metronidazole (5 micrograms), polymyxin b (300 micrograms) and colistin sulphate (10 micrograms), and they were susceptible to the six penicillins studied, cephalothin (30 micrograms), cefuroxime (30 micrograms), cefaclor (30 micrograms), ceftizoxime (30 micrograms), cefotaxime (30 micrograms), bacitracin (10 micrograms), chloramphenicol (30 micrograms), erythromycin (15 micrograms), clindamycin (2 micrograms), rifampicin (5 micrograms) and nitrofurantoin (300 micrograms). in addition, they varied in their susceptibility to cephradine (30 micrograms), cephazolin (30 micrograms), cefoperazone (75 micrograms), ceftriaxone (30 micrograms), ofloxacin (5 micrograms) and furazolidone (15 micrograms). they were resistant, or only marginally moderately susceptible, to ceftazidime (30 micrograms), netilmicin (10 micrograms), sulphamethoxazole (100 micrograms), cotrimoxazole (25 micrograms) and ciprofloxacin (5 micrograms), and susceptible or marginally moderately susceptible to tetracycline (30 micrograms). all b. bifidum isolates were susceptible to cefixime (5 micrograms). four microorganism-drug combinations were evaluated for beta-lactamase activity but its absence suggested that cell wall impermeability was responsible for cephalosporin resistance among bifidobacteria. the antibiotic susceptibility of b. animalis 25527t was similar to that of the human isolates.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == antiproliferative effect of fermented milk on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line.
AB  == in vivo and in vitro studies have shown an antitumor activity of lactobacilli in  colon cancer, and some epidemiologic studies have indicated a reduced risk of breast cancer in women who consume fermented milk products. we studied the direct effect of milk fermented by five bacteria strains (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus paracasei) on the growth of the mcf7 breast cancer cell line. our results showed a growth inhibition induced by all fermented milks, even though b. infantis and l. acidophilus were the most effective (85% inhibition after 9 days). the antiproliferative effect was not related to the presence of bacteria in fermented milk, and neither whole milk (crude or ultrahigh temperature sterlizied) nor its main fractions (lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin fraction) affected cell growth. our findings suggest the presence of an ex novo soluble compound produced by lactic acid bacteria during milk fermentation or the microbial transformation of some milk components in a biologically active form. although the mechanism of the antitumor activity is not clear, the present study  suggests the potentiality offered by fermented milk as producers of compounds with antiproliferative activity useful in the prevention and therapy of solid tumors like breast cancer.

TI  == differentiation of bifidobacteria by use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and  polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == several different genomic fingerprints can be obtained from various commercially-important species of bifidobacterium using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) following digestion of dna with xbai and spei. four different genomic finger printings were discernible for reference strains of bifidobacterium animalis, five for b. bifidum, three for b. breve, five for b. infantis and three for b. longum. standard commercially-available industrial strains of b. animalis are identical to the reference strain atcc 27536, previously isolated from chicken feces. there was more genomic heterogeneity among industrial strains of b. longum, in that only one gave profiles similar to  the type strain of this species (atcc 15707). the other 14 commercially-available strains of b. longum (mainly isolated from japanese commercial preparations) were divided into four new molecular types based on their pfge patterns. the pfge method indicated that only five distinct strains of b. longum and one strain of b. animalis are used in commercial preparations. additionally, the use of polymerase chain reaction amplification of portions of 16s rdna provides a highly specific technique to discriminate between the species b. breve, b. infantis and  b. longum.

TI  == selection of species-specific dna probes which detect strain restriction polymorphism in four bifidobacterium species.
AB  == randomly cloned fragments (in a size range 1 to 2.5 kb) of dna from bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, b. adolescentis cip 64.59t, b. bifidum cip 64.65 and b. animalis atcc 25527 were used as hybridization probes to characterize strains of these species and distinguish them from closely related bifidobacterium species. the fragments were screened for hybridization with native dna from 41 different bifidobacterium strains. for each species, a fragment hybridizing specifically with dna from strains of the same species was isolated. each fragment was then hybridized with restriction digests in order to  study the genome polymorphism. in some of the tested b. longum strains including  strain atcc 15707, the species-specific fragment l6/45 hybridized with 2 fragments instead of one as expected. sequence of the fragment revealed the presence of an orf which had an amino acid sequence similar to the site-specific  recombinases of lambda integrase family. moreover, southern analysis demonstrated that at least 3 copies of this fragment are present in the chromosome of b. longum atcc 15707 and in some other b. longum strains. the species-specific fragment a6/17 of b. adolescentis hybridized with the same restriction fragment on the eight strains of this species tested. the b. bifidum-specific fragment hybridized with different dna restriction fragments according to the strain. the  restriction fragment an1 from b. animalis atcc 25527 hybridized with the same restriction fragment from strain b. animalis atcc 27536. however, these two strains could be differentiated by another restriction pattern. thus, hybridization results highlight the genetic polymorphism which exists among bifidobacterium strains of the same species.

TI  == characterization of dairy-related bifidobacterium spp. based on their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns.
AB  == numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics based on enzymatic activity and  carbohydrate fermentation allowed the discrimination of most strains of bifidobacteria of animal origin from those of human origin. strains of bifidobacteria studied were separated into nine groups based on numerical analysis. three groups contained most strains of animal origin, three groups comprised both strains of animal and human origin, and three groups were strictly composed of strains of human origin. the results indicate that one group of animal origin (group ii) contained all reference strains of bifidobacterium animals and 10 strains isolated from fermented milks or commercial preparations.  although numerical analysis of enzymatic activities and carbohydrate fermentation patterns allowed the differentiation of 'wild' strains of b. animalis and b. longum isolated from commercial preparations, this method failed to confirm the species. in the present study, the determination of electrophoretic patterns of beta-galactosidases resulted in the development of a new technique for the differentiation of bifidobacterium species. several isoenzymes of beta-galactosidase were detected among strains of bifidobacteria. each species had a specific electrophoretic pattern. the detection of beta-galactosidase by electrophoresis is a new tool for distinguishing between dairy- and non-dairy-related bifidobacteria. dairy-related bifidobacteria (b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum) as well as b. animalis could be better differentiated from other bifidobacteria by comparison of their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns, rather than by numerical analysis of their phenotypic characteristics.
