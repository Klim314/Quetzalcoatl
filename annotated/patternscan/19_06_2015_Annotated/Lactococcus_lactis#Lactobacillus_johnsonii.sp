TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == expression and delivery of an endolysin to combat clostridium perfringens.
AB  == clostridium perfringens is a cause for increasing concern due to its responsibility for severe infections both in humans and animals, especially poultry. to find new control strategies to treat c. perfringens infection, we investigated the activity and delivery of a bacteriophage endolysin. we identified a new endolysin, designated cp25l, which shows similarity to an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase domain and is distinct from other c. perfringens endolysins whose activity has been demonstrated in vitro. the cp25l gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the gene product demonstrated lytic activity against all 25 c. perfringens strains tested. the probiotic strain lactobacillus johnsonii fi9785 was engineered to deliver the endolysin to the gastrointestinal tract. the integration of the nisrk two-component regulatory system from the lactococcus lactis nisin a biosynthesis  operon into the chromosome of l. johnsonii allowed constitutive expression of the endolysin under the control of the nisa promoter (p nisa ), while the use of a signal peptide (slpmod) led to successful secretion of the active endolysin to the surrounding media. the high specificity and activity of the endolysin suggest that it may be developed as an effective tool to enhance the control of c. perfringens by l. johnsonii in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid plca36 isolated from lactobacillus casei  zhang.
AB  == the complete 36,487 bp sequence of plasmid plca36 from lactobacillus casei zhang  was determined. plca36 contains 44 predicted coding regions, and to 23 of them functions could be assigned. for the first time, we identified a relbe toxin-antitoxin (ta) locus in a lactobacillus genus, perhaps indicating a potential role for plca36 in host survival under extreme nutritional stress. a region encoding a cluster of conjugation genes (tra) was also identified. the cluster showed high similarity and co-linearity with tra regions of pwcfs103 and  pmrc01 from lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis, respectively. comparative gene analysis revealed that plasmids from the genus lactobacillus may have contributed to the environmental adaptation mainly by providing carbohydrate and amino acid transporters. in addition, two chromosome-encoded relbe systems in lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri were identified.

TI  == bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk using pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). most of the identified bacterial species in zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (lab), e.g., streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus johnsonii. using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. the main dominant species was st. thermophilus followed by lc. garvieae. other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific pcr assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the ttge and dgge results. lc. garvieae, lc. raffinolactis, ln. citreum,  and lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of egyptian fermented milk.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum for oral peptide delivery.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli for their ability to persist and secrete heterologous protein in the oral cavity. methods and results: four different strains of common oral lactobacilli, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus murinus and lactobacillus plantarum, were  transformed with the plasmid pkth2121, which contains a secretion cassette for beta-lactamase. lactobacilli isolated from the mouth of host mice were also transformed with pkth2121 for later feeding. lactococcus lactis, transformed with pkth2121, was also fed to mice as a negative control. all transformed isolates were fed to c57black mice in varying schedules. the number of transformed bacteria persisting in the mouth was reported as a percentage of total oral bacteria recovered by swabbing. conclusions: the transformed l. lactis, l. brevis, l. johnsonii, l. murinus, and the endogenous murine lactobacillus strain  failed to persist in the mouth. transformed l. plantarum, however, persisted in the mouth and comprised up to 25% of the total lactobacilli at 18 h and 10% at 24 h after feeding. l. plantarum recovered after feeding retained its ability to secrete beta-lactamase into culture medium efficiently. beta-lactamase activity could be detected in oral secretions at 8 h after feedings. after repeated feedings, however, the l. plantarum containing pkth2121 gradually lost its ability to persist after feedings. this experiment demonstrates that l. plantarum can transiently colonize the oral mucosa in large numbers, while continuously secreting foreign proteins, raising the possibility of using lactobacilli as a vector for delivery of oral mucosal peptides.

TI  == comparative and functional analysis of the rrna-operons and their trna gene complement in different lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the complete genome sequences of the lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and lactobacillus johnsonii were used to compare location, sequence, organisation, and regulation of the ribosomal rna (rrn) operons. all rrn operons of the examined lab diverge from the origin of replication, which is compatible with their efficient expression. all operons show a common organisation of 5'-16s-23s-5s-3' structure, but differ in the number, location and specificity of the trna genes. in the 16s-23s intergenic spacer region, two of the five rrn operons of lb. plantarum and three of the six  of lb. johnsonii contain trna-ala and trna-ile genes, while l. lactis has a trna-ala gene in all six operons. the number of trna genes following the 5s rrna  gene ranges up to 14, 16, and 21 for l. lactis, lb. johnsonii and lb. plantarum,  respectively. the trna gene complements are similar to each other and to those of other bacteria. micro-heterogeneity was found within the rrna structural genes and spacer regions of each strain. in the rrn operon promoter regions of lb. plantarum and l. lactis marked differences were found, while the promoter regions of lb. johnsonii showed a similar tandem promoter structure in all operons. the rrn promoters of l. lactis show either a single or a tandem promoter structure. all promoters of lb. plantarum contain two or three -10 and -35 regions, of which either zero to two were followed by an up-element. the lb. plantarum rrna, rrnb,  and rrnc promoter regions display similarity to the rrn promoter structure of esherichia coli. differences in regulation between the five lb. plantarum promoters were studied using a low copy promoter-probe plasmid. taking copy number and growth rate into account, a differential expression over time was shown. although all five lb. plantarum rrn promoters are significantly different, this study shows that their activity was very similar under the circumstances tested. an active promoter was also identified within the lb. plantarum rrnc operon preceding a cluster of 17 trna genes.

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140: identification of the atp (atpbefhagdc) operon  and analysis of its genetic structure, characteristics, and phylogeny.
AB  == the atp operon is highly conserved among eubacteria, and it has been considered a molecular marker as an alternative to the 16s rrna gene. pcr primers were designed from the consensus sequences of the atpd gene to amplify partial atpd sequences from 12 bifidobacterium species and nine lactobacillus species. all pcr products were sequenced and aligned with other atpd sequences retrieved from public databases. genes encoding the subunits of the f(1)f(0)-atpase of bifidobacterium lactis dsm 10140 (atpbefhagdc) were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences of these subunits showed significant homology with the sequences of other organisms. we identified specific sequence signatures for  the genus bifidobacterium and for the closely related taxa bifidobacterium lactis and bifidobacterium animalis and lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii, which could provide an alternative to current methods for identification of lactic acid bacterial species. northern blot analysis showed that there was a transcript at approximately 7.3 kb, which corresponded to the size of the atp operon, and a transcript at 4.5 kb, which corresponded to the atpc, atpd, atpg, and atpa genes. the transcription initiation sites of these two mrnas were mapped by primer extension, and the results revealed no consensus promoter sequences. phylogenetic analysis of the atpd genes demonstrated that the lactobacillus atpd gene clustered with the genera listeria, lactococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus and that the higher g+c content and highly biased codon usage with respect to the genome average support the hypothesis that there  was probably horizontal gene transfer. the acid inducibility of the atp operon of b. lactis dsm 10140 was verified by slot blot hybridization by using rna isolated from acid-treated cultures of b. lactis dsm 10140. the rapid increase in the level of atp operon transcripts upon exposure to low ph suggested that the atpase complex of b. lactis dsm 10140 was regulated at the level of transcription and not at the enzyme assembly step.

TI  == the prophages of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533: comparative genomics and transcription analysis.
AB  == two non-inducible, but apparently complete prophages were identified in the genome of the sequenced lactobacillus johnsonii strain ncc 533. the 38- and 40-kb-long prophages lj928 and lj965 represent distinct lineages of sfi11-like pac-site siphoviridae unrelated at the dna sequence level. the deduced structural proteins from lj928 demonstrated aa sequence identity with lactococcus lactis phage tp901-1, while lj965 shared sequence links with streptococcus thermophilus  phage o1205. with the exception of trna genes, inserted between dna replication and dna packaging genes, the transcription of the prophage was restricted to the  genome segments near both attachment sites. transcribed genes unrelated to phage  functions were inserted between the phage repressor and integrase genes; one group of genes shared sequence relatedness with a mobile dna element in staphylococcus aureus. a short, but highly transcribed region was located between the phage lysin and right attachment site; it lacked a protein-encoding function  in one prophage.

TI  == sequence analysis of plbb1, a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == the first report of the complete nucleotide sequence of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (lactobacillus bulgaricus) is presented. the plasmid plbb1 consists of 6127 bp with a gc content of 44.8%. no ssdna was detected by hybridization experiments, which is consistent with the notion that plbb1 does not replicate by a rolling circle mechanism. a putative replication region of plbb1 was cloned and found to be functional in lactobacillus johnsonii and lactococcus lactis. plasmid plbb1 showed significant  dna sequence identity with plasmid pll1212 from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  lactis (lactobacillus lactis) crl1212 (genbank accession no. af109691). four open reading frames (orfs) larger than 100 amino acids were identified. orfa shared similarity with a putative primase-helicase system, and orfb and orfc exhibited limited identity with a mobilization protein and a transposase, respectively. curing experiments did not allowed us to assign a function to the orfs.

TI  == expression of clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase gene in lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii and characterization of the genetically modified probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == endoglucanase a from clostridium thermocellum resistant to pancreatic proteinase  was selected out of a range of microbial cellulases expressed in lactobacilli. two lactobacillus-e. coli expression vectors, harboring the endoglucanase gene from c. thermocellum under the control of its own promoter (psd1) and the lactococcus lactis lac a promoter (psd2), were constructed separately. intestinal lactobacillus strains, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii, were electrotransformed with  psd1 and psd2, and the stability of each plasmid was evaluated. the endoglucanase activities of 0.722 and 0.759 u/ml were respectively found in culture medium of l. gasseri and l. johnsonii containing psd1, and of 0.407 u/ml in medium of l. gasseri harboring psd2. when the probiotic characteristics such as acid-tolerance, bile-salt tolerance, and antibiotic susceptibility were investigated, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii were resistant to low phs of 2 and 3. also, l. johnsonii was bile-salt resistant in the presence of 0.5% oxgall and porcine bile extract. l. johnsonii and l. gasseri showed a rather homogeneous resistant pattern against tested antibiotics. both strains were resistant to amikacin, bacitracin, gentamicin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and colistin.

TI  == d-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhd) inactivation and resulting metabolic effects  in the lactobacillus johnsonii strains la1 and n312.
AB  == lactobacillus johnsonii la1, a probiotic bacterium with demonstrated health effects, grows in milk, where it ferments lactose to d- and l-lactate in a 60:40% ratio. the d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-ldh) gene (ldhd) of this strain was isolated, and an in vitro-truncated copy of that gene was used to inactivate the  genomic copy in two strains, la1 and n312, by gene replacement. for that, an 8-bp deletion was generated within the cloned ldhd gene to inactivate its function. the plasmid containing the altered ldhd was transferred to l. johnsonii via conjugative comobilization with lactococcus lactis carrying pambeta1. crossover integrations of the plasmid at the genomic ldhd site were selected, and appropriate resolution of the cointegrate structures resulted in mutants that had lost the plasmid and in which the original ldhd was replaced by the truncated copy. these mutants completely lacked d-ldh activity. nevertheless, the lower remaining l-ldh activity of the cells was sufficient to reroute most of the accumulating pyruvate to l-lactate. only a marginal increase in production of the secondary end products acetaldehyde, diacetyl, and acetoin was observed. it can be concluded that in l. johnsonii d- and l-ldh are present in substantial excess  for their role to eliminate pyruvate and regenerate nad(+) and that accumulated pyruvate is therefore not easily redirected in high amounts to secondary metabolic routes.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.
