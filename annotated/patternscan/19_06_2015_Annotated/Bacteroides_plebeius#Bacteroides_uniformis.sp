TI  == influence of environmental and genetic factors linked to celiac disease risk on infant gut colonization by bacteroides species.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated enteropathy involving genetic and environmental factors whose interaction might influence disease risk. the aim of  this study was to determine the effects of milk-feeding practices and the hla-dq  genotype on intestinal colonization of bacteroides species in infants at risk of  cd development. this study included 75 full-term newborns with at least one first-degree relative suffering from cd. infants were classified according to milk-feeding practice (breast-feeding or formula feeding) and hla-dq genotype (high or low genetic risk). stools were analyzed at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months by pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the bacteroides species diversity index was higher in formula-fed infants than in breast-fed infants. breast-fed infants showed a higher prevalence of bacteroides uniformis at 1 and 4 months of age, while formula-fed infants had a higher prevalence of b. intestinalis at all sampling times, of b. caccae at 7 days and 4 months, and of b. plebeius at 4 months. infants with high genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of b. vulgatus, while those with low genetic risk showed a higher prevalence of b. ovatus, b. plebeius, and b. uniformis. among breast-fed infants, the prevalence of b. uniformis was higher in those with low genetic risk than in  those with high genetic risk. among formula-fed infants, the prevalence of b. ovatus and b. plebeius was increased in those with low genetic risk, while the prevalence of b. vulgatus was higher in those with high genetic risk. the results indicate that both the type of milk feeding and the hla-dq genotype influence the colonization process of bacteroides species, and possibly the disease risk.

TI  == bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov., bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. and bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov., isolated from chicken caecum.
AB  == eight bacterial strains isolated from the caecum of chicken, bl2(t), bl66, eg3, eg6, m27, bl78(t), c35(t) and c43, were characterized by determining their phenotypic characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles, menaquinone profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates belonged to the genus bacteroides. one group of five strains (bl2(t), bl66, eg3, eg6 and m27) was related most closely to bacteroides coprocola jcm 12979(t), with approximately 93 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, and to bacteroides plebeius jcm 12973(t), with about 92 % similarity, and shared >or=99.6 % similarity with each other. strain bl78(t) exhibited 90.5 % similarity to b. plebeius jcm 12973(t) and 89.8 % similarity to b. coprocola jcm 12979(t) and differed from the above group of five strains at >or=10 % sequence divergence. strains c35(t) and c43 were related most closely to bacteroides eggerthii jcm 12986(t), with 95.1 % sequence similarity, to bacteroides stercoris jcm 9496(t), with 94.6 % similarity, and to bacteroides  uniformis jcm 5828(t), with 94.4 % similarity, and shared 100 % similarity with each other. from results of phenotypic examination, cellular fatty acid composition analysis, menaquinone composition analysis and dna g+c contents, the  group of five strains as well as strain bl78(t) were shown to differ from the type strains of b. coprocola and b. plebeius. strain bl78(t) differed from the others based on its menaquinone composition, which included mk-11 and mk-12. strains c35(t) and c43 could also be differentiated from the type strains of b. eggerthii, b. stercoris and b. uniformis. the group of five strains, strain bl78(t), b. coprocola jcm 12979(t) and b. plebeius jcm 12973(t) showed low levels of dna-dna relatedness (<35 %) with each other. high levels of dna-dna relatedness were obtained within the group of five strains (>75 %). strains c35(t) and c43 exhibited a high level of dna-dna relatedness (>88 %) with each other, but low levels with b. eggerthii jcm 12986(t) (<40 %), b. stercoris jcm 9496(t) (<37 %) and b. uniformis jcm 5828(t) (<16 %). on the basis of these data, three novel bacteroides species are proposed: bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov. (type strain bl2(t)=jcm 13652(t)=dsm 18169(t)), bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. (type strain bl78(t)=jcm 13657(t)=dsm 18170(t)) and bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov. (type strain c35(t)=jcm 13658(t)=dsm 18171(t)).
