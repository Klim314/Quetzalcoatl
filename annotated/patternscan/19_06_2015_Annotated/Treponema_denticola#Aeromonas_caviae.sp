TI  == construction of coa-dependent 1-butanol synthetic pathway functions under aerobic conditions in escherichia coli.
AB  == 1-butanol is an important industrial platform chemical and an advanced biofuel. while various groups have attempted to construct synthetic pathways for 1-butanol production, efforts to construct a pathway that functions under aerobic conditions have met with limited success. here, we constructed a coa-dependent 1-butanol synthetic pathway that functions under aerobic conditions in escherichia coli, by expanding the previously reported (r)-1,3-butanediol synthetic pathway. the pathway consists of phaa (acetyltransferase) and phab (nadph-dependent acetoacetyl-coa reductase) from ralstonia eutropha, phaj ((r)-specific enoyl-coa hydratase) from aeromonas caviae, ter (trans-enoyl-coa reductase) from treponema denticola, bld (butylraldehyde dehydrogenase) from clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum, and inherent alcohol dehydrogenase(s) from e. coli. to evaluate the potential of this pathway for 1-butanol production, culture conditions, including volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (kla) and ph were optimized in a mini-jar fermenter. under optimal conditions, 1-butanol was produced at a concentration of up to 8.60gl(-1) after 46h of fed-batch cultivation.
