TI  == one-step purification and porin transport activity of the major outer membrane proteins p2 from haemophilus influenzae, foma from fusobacterium nucleatum and porb from neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == bacterial porins are major outer membrane proteins that function as essential solute transporters between the bacteria and the extracellular environment. structural features of porins are also recognized by eukaryotic cell receptors involved in innate and adaptive immunity. to better investigate the function of porins, proper refolding is necessary following purification from inclusion bodies [1, 2]. using a single-step size exclusion chromatographic method, we have purified three major porins from pathogenic bacteria, the ompp2 (p2) from haemophilus influenzae, foma from fusobacterium nucleatum and porb from neisseria meningitidis, at high yield and report their unique solute transport activity with size exclusion limit. furthermore, we have optimized their purification method and achieved improvement of their thermostability for facilitating functional and structural analyses.

TI  == bacterial periplasmic sialic acid-binding proteins exhibit a conserved binding site.
AB  == sialic acids are a family of related nine-carbon sugar acids that play important  roles in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. these sialic acids are incorporated/decorated onto lipooligosaccharides as terminal sugars in multiple bacteria to evade the host immune system. many pathogenic bacteria scavenge sialic acids from their host and use them for molecular mimicry. the first step of this process is the transport of sialic acid to the cytoplasm, which often takes place using a tripartite atp-independent transport system consisting of a periplasmic binding protein and a membrane transporter. in this paper, the structural characterization of periplasmic binding proteins from the pathogenic bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum, pasteurella multocida and vibrio cholerae and their thermodynamic characterization are reported. the binding affinities of several mutations in the neu5ac binding site of the haemophilus influenzae protein are also reported. the structure and the thermodynamics of the binding of sugars suggest that all of these proteins have a very well conserved binding pocket and similar binding affinities. a significant conformational change occurs when these proteins bind the sugar. while the c1 carboxylate has been identified  as the primary binding site, a second conserved hydrogen-bonding network is involved in the initiation and stabilization of the conformational states.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial recovery and viability from three different swab transport systems.
AB  == this study evaluated three types of swab transport systems for organism recovery. swabs with transport media were further assessed for organism viability over 24 hours over a range of different storage temperatures. test organisms consisted of aerobes, fastidious aerobes and anaerobes. swabs were tested according to the standardised quantitative elution method published by the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi; m-40a). there were substantial differences in primary  organism recovery, with recovery rates from different swabs ranging from <0.1% to 78% for streptococcus pyogenes. similar differences were noted for other test organisms. in general, the flocked swab (eswab) demonstrated highest rates of recovery for aerobic organisms, while higher rates of recovery of fusobacterium nucleatum were demonstrated from a standard swab (transwab). when considering organism viability, no single swab fulfilled all the criteria stipulated by the m-40a standard for all organism/temperature combinations. organism viability was  marginally better for the gel-based swab transport systems as compared to the liquid-media based eswab. significant differences between swab transport systems  were demonstrated, including differences for primary organism recovery and viability. the eswab showed the best recovery of organisms, while gel-based media demonstrated marginally better bacterial viability for most tested retention times and temperatures.

TI  == toll-like receptor 2-dependent activity of native major outer membrane protein proteosomes of chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  == chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen  and the etiologic agent of blinding trachoma. intracellular signaling pathways leading to host cell inflammation and innate immunity to chlamydia include those  mediated by toll-like receptors (tlrs) and nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 1 (nod1) protein. in epithelial cells, tlr-dependent signaling contributes to local immune responses via induction of inflammatory mediators. there is evidence that tlr3, tlr4, and, particularly, tlr2 are critical for chlamydia-mediated host cell activation and pathology. despite the importance of  tlr2, major chlamydial tlr2 antigens have not been identified so far. numerous bacterial porins are known tlr2 agonists, i.e., porins from neisseriae, shigella, salmonella, haemophilus influenzae, and fusobacterium nucleatum, which share structural and functional similarities with the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (momp), a strong antigen candidate for a potential vaccine against c. trachomatis. we describe the ability of purified, detergent-free momp to signal via tlr2 in vitro in tlr-overexpressing cells and tlr2-competent human reproductive tract epithelial cell lines. using momp formed in pure protein micelles (proteosomes), we show the induction of tlr2-dependent interleukin-8 (il-8) and il-6 secretion in vitro, the involvement of tlr1 as a tlr2 coreceptor, and the activation of both nf-kappab and mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase intracellular pathways. interestingly, momp proteosomes induce cytokine secretion in endocervical epithelial cells (end/e6e7) but not in urethral epithelial cells  (thuecs). a detailed understanding of the tlr2-dependent molecular mechanisms that characterize the effect of momp proteosomes on host cells may provide new insights for its successful development as an immunotherapeutic target against chlamydia.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of atcc and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  == despite limitations of swab transport systems (sts), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. we evaluated the performance of 4 commercial sts: m40 transystem (s1, copan italia, bovezzo, italy), uni-ter (s2, meus, piove di sacco, italy), euromed (s3, lab service, surbo, italy), and eurotubo (s4, deltalab, rubi, spain). survival of atcc and clinical strains with  characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (nccls m40-a) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. after 24 h, only s1 was able to maintain streptococcus  pneumoniae (atcc 6305), haemophilus influenzae (10211), and neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all sts except s1 (46% recovery). eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with s1. resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the sts.

TI  == cross-reactivity of groel antibodies with human heat shock protein 60 and quantification of pathogens in atherosclerosis.
AB  == background/aims: chronic infections such as those caused by chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein (hhsp) 60. methods: we  examined the cross-reactivity of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies with hhsp60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. results: after absorption of plasma samples with hhsp60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hhsp60. all of the artery specimens were positive for p. gingivalis. fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, c. pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, and haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. the prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. conclusions: these results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial hsps including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hhsp60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.

TI  == bactericidal activities of methoxyfluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin  against aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens in serum.
AB  == gatifloxacin (bristol-myers squibb) and moxifloxacin (bayer) are new methoxyfluoroquinolones with broad-spectrum activity against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens of the respiratory tract. in this investigation, we analyzed  the bactericidal activity in serum over time of these antimicrobials against three aerobic (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus) and four anaerobic (peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus magnus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella melaninogenica) bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections. serum samples were obtained from 11 healthy male subjects following a single 400-mg oral dose of gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. these samples were collected prior to and at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after the dose of each drug. gatifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 12 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic  = 0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml), and f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml) and 24 h against h. influenzae (mic = 0.03 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus  (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and prevotella melaninogenica (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml). moxifloxacin exhibited bactericidal activity for a median of 24 h against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), h. influenzae (mic = 0.015 micro g/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 0.06 micro g/ml), f. nucleatum (mic = 0.5 micro g/ml), prevotella melaninogenica (mic =0.5 micro g/ml), peptostreptococcus magnus (mic = 0.125 micro g/ml), and peptostreptococcus micros (mic = 0.25 micro g/ml). the results from this pharmacodynamic study suggest that these fluoroquinolones would have prolonged killing activity against these organisms in vivo and may have clinical utility in the treatment of mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections.

TI  == regulation of riboflavin biosynthesis and transport genes in bacteria by transcriptional and translational attenuation.
AB  == the riboflavin biosynthesis in bacteria was analyzed using comparative analysis of genes, operons and regulatory elements. a model for regulation based on formation of alternative rna structures involving the rfn elements is suggested.  in gram-positive bacteria including actinomycetes, thermotoga, thermus and deinococcus, the riboflavin metabolism and transport genes are predicted to be regulated by transcriptional attenuation, whereas in most gram-negative bacteria, the riboflavin biosynthesis genes seem to be regulated on the level of translation initiation. several new candidate riboflavin transporters were identified (impx in desulfitobacterium halfniense and fusobacterium nucleatum; pnux in several actinomycetes, including some corynebacterium species and strepto myces coelicolor; rfnt in rhizobiaceae). traces of a number of likely horizontal  transfer events were found: the complete riboflavin operon with the upstream regulatory element was transferred to haemophilus influenzae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae from some gram-positive bacterium; non-regulated riboflavin operon in pyrococcus furiousus was likely transferred from thermotoga; and the rfn element was inserted into the riboflavin operon of pseudomonas aeruginosa from some other pseudomonas species, where it had regulated the ribh2 gene.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == an aminopeptidase nutritionally important to fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the properties of an aminopeptidase (ap) from fusobacterium nucleatum were studied in view of the fact that this organism, along with other gram-negative anaerobes involved in periodontal diseases, survives in the subgingival environment by obtaining energy via the fermentation of a small number of peptide-derived amino acids. the ap was found to be cell-associated and was isolated from disrupted chemostat-grown cells. it was purified by (nh4)2so4 fractionation, two column chromatographic steps and ief. the enzyme was found to  have a molecular mass of 54 kda, a pi of 5.1, a ph optimum between 7.5 and 8.0 and, using leu-ala as substrate, it gave k(m) and vmax values of 0.66 mm and 0.12 mumol min-1 mg-1, respectively. no complete homology was found between the n-terminal sequence of the first 20 amino acids (mdxkxyvdlkerflryvkfn...) and any other published sequence, but residues 8-20 gave a 62% match with residues 9-21 of an ap from haemophilus influenzae. the enzyme was inactivated by chelating agents, bestatin, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and some heavy metals. cobalt ions restored edta-inactivated activity but did not reverse inhibition by 1,10-phenanthroline. in addition, bestatin and 1,10-phenanthroline had an inhibitory effect on the batch growth of f. nucleatum in a complex medium in which peptidase activities would be nutritionally essential. no such inhibition was observed in a chemically defined medium in which growth was not dependent upon peptidase activities. the peptidase described in this paper therefore appears to be a cobalt-activated metallo-ap which, together with other peptidases, is considered to be important in the survival of f. nucleatum in the  subgingival environment of the mouth.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == microbiology of the transition from acute to chronic maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == repeated aspirations of sinus secretions by endoscopy was performed in five patients over a period of 34-50 days and, ultimately, surgical drainage was done  in three who presented with acute maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and became chronic. the aspirates were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. most of the bacteria isolated from the first culture were aerobic or facultative bacteria: streptococcus pneumoniae (three isolates), haemophilus influenzae non-type-b (two) and moraxella catarrhalis (one). three of these cultures yielded bacteria that were resistant to the antimicrobial agents prescribed for treatment. failure to respond to therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in subsequent aspirates. these organisms included fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. eradication of the infection was achieved in all instances following the administration of antimicrobial agents effective against these bacteria, and in three instances by surgical drainage. this study illustrates the microbial dynamics of maxillary sinusitis that did not respond to antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == the use of genomic dna fingerprinting in studies of the epidemiology of bacteria  in periodontitis.
AB  == recent studies of microbial epidemiology emphasizing the genetic organization and distribution of organisms associated with orofacial infections have led to new insights into the possible origins of pathogenicity. studies into genetic heterogeneity, acquisition and transmission of these organisms have been markedly advanced by the utilization of the powerful technique of genomic dna fingerprinting. characteristic fingerprints for each bacterial isolate can be produced by cleavage of high molecular weight genomic dna by restriction endonucleases. it is assumed that each dna fingerprint represents a clonal type.  in this report, we review and analyze studies of the epidemiology of bacteria associated with orofacial infections with an emphasis on periodontal disease. studies of nontypable (nt) haemophilus influenzae associated with recurrent otitis media illustrate the utility of this technique. dna fingerprinting clearly demonstrates genetic heterogeneity of nt h. influenzae isolates, and clonality of infection of any individual. furthermore, dna fingerprinting has shown that the same clonal type is seen in siblings concurrently suffering from otitis media, suggesting horizontal transmission within the family. studies of mutans streptococci also show extensive genetic heterogeneity and show vertical transmission of a predominant clonal type only from mother to infant, but not from father to infant. studies of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans show considerable genetic heterogeneity among monkey isolates. thus far, three clonal  types have been reported with dna fingerprinting among isolates from periodontal  patients, but additional genetic heterogeneity can be found using specific dna fragments as probes in hybridization experiments. intrafamilial transmission of a. actinomycetemcomitans has been demonstrated. porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis shows extensive genetic heterogeneity and case reports suggest clonal  infection of any one individual. in contrast, results with dna fingerprinting of  eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides intermedius show that individuals may be infected with 2 or more clonal types. these studies point to the great potential of dna fingerprinting for investigating the epidemiology of putative orofacial pathogens. such studies with periodontal microorganisms will likely reveal steps in the acquisition, intraoral and person-to-person transmission, which then could possibly be inhibited or interfered with to prevent periodontal disease or its recurrence.

TI  == emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB  == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. a significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteroides species and fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. one beta-lactamase producing staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase-production in haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae or branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli strain. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice  in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group a streptococci when previous treatment has failed.
