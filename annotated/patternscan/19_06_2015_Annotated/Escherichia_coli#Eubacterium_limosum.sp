TI  == cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) allelic variants relate to shifts in faecal microbiota of cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  == introduction: in this study we investigated the effects of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene variants on the composition of faecal microbiota, in patients affected by cystic fibrosis (cf). cftr mutations (f508del is the most common) lead to a decreased secretion of chloride/water, and to mucus sticky secretions, in pancreas, respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. intestinal manifestations are underestimated in cf, leading to ileum meconium at  birth, or small bowel bacterial overgrowth in adult age. methods: thirty-six cf patients, fasting and under no-antibiotic treatment, were cftr genotyped on both  alleles. faecal samples were subjected to molecular microbial profiling through temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis and species-specific pcr. ecological parameters and multivariate algorithms were employed to find out if cftr variants could be related to the microbiota structure. results: patients were classified by two different criteria: 1) presence/absence of f508del mutation; 2) disease severity in heterozygous and homozygous f508del patients. we found that homozygous-f508del and severe cf patients exhibited an enhanced dysbiotic faecal microbiota composition, even within the cf cohort itself, with higher biodiversity and evenness. we also found, by species-specific pcr, that potentially harmful species (escherichia coli and eubacterium biforme) were abundant in homozygous-f508del and severe cf patients, while beneficial species (faecalibacterium prausnitzii, bifidobacterium spp., and eubacterium limosum) were reduced. conclusions: this is the first report that establishes a link among cftr variants and shifts in faecal microbiota, opening the way to studies that perceive cf as a 'systemic disease', linking the lung and the gut in a joined axis.

TI  == effect of apple intake on fecal microbiota and metabolites in humans.
AB  == the effects of apple intake on the fecal flora, water content, ph, and metabolic  activities in eight healthy volunteers and the utilization of apple pectin in vitro were investigated. although several isolates of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, enterococcus, and the bacteroides fragilis group utilized apple pectin, most isolates of escherichia coli, collinsela aerofaciense, eubacterium limosum, and clostridium perfringens could not. when fecal samples from healthy adults were incubated in liquid broth with apple pectin present or absent, the numbers of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in the former were higher than those in the later. after the intake of apples (2 apples a day for 2 weeks) by eight healthy adult humans, the number of bifidobacteria in feces increased (p < 0.05 on day 7 and p < 0.01 on day 14 of the intake period), and the numbers of lactobacillus and streptococcus including enterococcus tended to increase. however, lecithinase-positive clostridia, including c. perfringens, decreased (p  < 0.05), and enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas tended to decrease. moreover, the concentrations of fecal acetic acid tended to increase on apple intake. the fecal ammonia concentration showed a tendency to reduce and fecal sulfide decreased (p  < 0.05) on apple intake. these findings indicate that apple consumption is related to an improved intestinal environment, and apple pectin is one of the effective apple components improving the fecal environment.

TI  == stereochemical course of the generation of 3-mercaptohexanal and 3-mercaptohexanol by beta-lyase-catalyzed cleavage of cysteine conjugates.
AB  == the product resulting from the reaction between e-2-hexenal and l-cysteine was shown to be a diastereoisomeric mixture of 2-(2-s-l-cysteinylpentyl)-1,3-thiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid 1. treatment of the  conjugate with two sources of cysteine-s-conjugate beta-lyase (tryptophanase from e. coli and a crude enzyme extract prepared from eubacterium limosum) resulted in the formation of 3-mercaptohexanal. the reaction proceeded with a slight preference for the (s)-configured product, however, with low conversion rate. the role of 3-s-l-cysteinylhexanal 2 as substrate for beta-lyases was demonstrated by in situ generation of 2 from 3-s-(n-acetyl-l-cysteinyl)hexanal using acylase. opposite enantioselectivity was observed for the liberation of 3-mercaptohexanol  from 3-s-l-cysteinylhexanol 5 by the enzyme preparations from eubacterium limosum and tryptophanase. various yeasts produced 3-mercaptohexanol starting from 1 as well as from 5. the reactions proceeded without preferential formation of one of  the enantiomers.

TI  == eubacterium bacteremia and colon cancer.
AB  == eubacterium bacteremia is rare. we report a senile patient who presented with 3 episodes of bacteremia, caused by clostridium perfringens, eubacterium limosum and escherichia coli, respectively, which led to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma  of the colon. a differential diagnosis of colon cancer should be considered in patients with eubacterium bacteremia.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

TI  == evaluation of n-acetylchitooligosaccharides as the main carbon sources for the growth of intestinal bacteria.
AB  == n-acetylchitooligosaccharides ((glcnac)(n)) with different degrees of polymerization (n=1-6) were prepared as the main carbon sources in media for evaluating the growth of nine intestinal bacteria. a chitohydrolysate was prepared by hydrolyzing shrimp-shell chitin using hcl. after purification, the purity of each (glcnac)(1-6) was >86%. the growth of intestinal bacteria was carried out in a basal medium (bm) containing 0.2% (w/v) of each sugar or glucose as the main carbon source and was evaluated using maximum cell densities and specific growth rates. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens could respectively utilize glcnac and (glcnac)(2) more efficiently for growth than glucose. bifidobacterium adolescentis and eubacterium limosum could use (glcnac)(1-6) slightly as their main carbon source. escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis and proteus vulgaris could utilize glucose more efficiently than (glcnac)(1-6). glcnac was used more readily than (glcnac)(2-6) by staphylococcus  aureus, exhibiting almost the same specific growth rates. in bm, streptococcus faecalis grew well even without adding each of the sugars tested.

TI  == identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (trfps): a rapid, pcr-based method.
AB  == identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. we have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of a 16s rrna gene fragment using a pair of universal pcr primers.  the forward pcr primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-fam)  fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the pcr products after digestion with restriction enzymes. the pcr products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an  automated dna sequencer. the data was analysed with genescan software 2.1. eleven bacteria (eubacterium biforme, e. limosum, peptostreptococcus productus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, c. perfringens and escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were  successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. this protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == synthesis of 4-aza-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole and biosynthetic preparation of 4- and 7-aza-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide.
AB  == we report on the preparation of 4-aza-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide and 5,6-dimethyl-7-azabenzimidazolylcobamide. these vitamin b12-analogs were required as reference compounds for comparison with a corrinoid previously isolated in small amounts for eubacterium limosum grown in the presence of 4(5)-aminoimidazole. 4(7)-aza-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole was synthesized from n-1-benzyl-4-nitroimidazole which was reduced to n-1-benzyl-4-aminoimidazole and  condensed with 1-dimethylamino-2-methylbutan-3-one to yield n-1-benzyl-4-aza-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole. the benzyl group of this compound was split off by catalytic hydrogenation to form 4(7)-aza-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole.  4(7)-aza-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole was transformed by a growing culture of propionibacterium shermanii into 4-aza-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide and 5,6-dimethyl-7-azabenzimidazolylcobamide. both vitamin b12-analogs were almost as active as vitamin b12 in a growth test with the vitamin b12-dependent escherichia coli-mutant dsm 4261.

TI  == pcr detection and quantitation of predominant anaerobic bacteria in human and animal fecal samples.
AB  == pcr procedures based on 16s rrna gene sequences specific for 12 anaerobic bacteria that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed and used for quantitative detection of these species in human (adult and baby) feces and animal (rat, mouse, cat, dog, monkey, and rabbit) feces. fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, and clostridium clostridiiforme had high pcr titers (the maximum dilutions for positive pcr results ranged from 10(-3) to 10(-8)) in all of the human and animal fecal samples tested. bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, and eubacterium limosum also  showed higher pcr titers (10(-2) to 10(-6)) in adult human feces. the other bacteria tested, including escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, eubacterium biforme, and bacteroides distasonis, were either at low pcr titers (less than 10(-2)) or not detected by pcr. the reported pcr procedure including the fecal sample preparation method is simplified and rapid and eliminates the dna isolation steps.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

TI  == distribution of cysteine conjugate beta-lyase in gastrointestinal bacteria and in the environment.
AB  == a cysteine conjugate beta-lyase was detected in 24 of 43 gastrointestinal bacteria tested, and from mixed populations of bacteria obtained from lake, river and soil samples. these bacterial cysteine conjugate beta-lyases catalyse the cleavage of the thioether linkage of both an s-alkyl- and an s-aryl-linked cysteine conjugate (2-s-cysteinyl-n-isopropylacetanilide (cysteine conjugate of propachlor) and s-(2-benzothiazolylcysteine), respectively). a cysteine conjugate beta-lyase was isolated from eubacterium limosum at levels at least 16-fold greater than those from any other gastrointestinal bacterial tested. this enzymic activity was present from the late lag phase through the stationary phase of growth of the bacteria. maximum activity occurred in the mid log phase. a cysteine conjugate beta-lyase isolated from animal and plant tissues cleaved only the s-aryl-linked cysteine conjugate (s-(2-benzothiazolyl)cysteine) and generally had less enzymic activity than enzymes isolated from the bacteria. glutathione-s-transferase activity was not detected in the 43 gastrointestinal bacteria tested, except for a low level (0.6 nmol/min per mg) of activity in escherichia coli. no s-methyl transferase activity was detected in the gastrointestinal bacteria or mixed populations of bacteria tested.
