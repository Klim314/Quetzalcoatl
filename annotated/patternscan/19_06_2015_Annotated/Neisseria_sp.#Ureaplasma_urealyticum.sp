TI  == human papillomavirus and other genital infections in indigenous women from paraguay: a cross-sectional analytical study.
AB  == background: the incidence of cervical cancer in paraguay is among the highest in  the world, with the human papillomavirus (hpv) being a necessary factor for cervical cancer. knowledge about hpv infection among indigenous women is limited. this cross-sectional study analyzed the frequency of hpv and other genital infections in indigenous paraguayan women of the department of presidente hayes.  methods: this study included 181 sexually active women without cervical lesions.  they belonged to the following ethnicities: maka (n = 40); nivacle (n = 23); sanapana (n = 33); enxet sur (n = 51) and toba-qom (n = 34). the detection of hpv and other gynecological infectious microorganisms was performed by either molecular methods (for mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis), gram staining and/or culture (for gardnerella vaginalis, candida sp, trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae), serological methods (for treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus [hiv]) or cytology (cervical inflammation). results: a high prevalence (41.4%) of women positive for at least  one sexually transmitted infection (sti) was found (23.2% any-type hpv, 11.6% t pallidum, 10.5% t vaginalis, 9.9% c trachomatis and 0.6% hiv) with 12.2% having more than one sti. hpv infection was the most frequent, with 16.1% of women positive for high-risk hpv types. there was a statistically significant association observed between any-type hpv and c trachomatis (p = 0.004), which indicates that the detection of one of these agents should suggest the presence of the other. there was no association between any-type hpv and other genital infections or cervical inflammation, suggesting that other mechanism could exist  to favor infection with the virus. conclusion: this multidisciplinary work suggests that stis are frequent, making it necessary to implement control measures and improve diagnosis in order to increase the number of cases detected, especially in populations with poor access to health centers.

TI  == antibiotic sb22484: a novel complex of the aurodox group. i. taxonomy of the producing organism, isolation of the antibiotics and chemical and biological characterization.
AB  == antibiotic sb22484 is a novel member of the aurodox type antibiotic group produced in submerged-fermentation cultures of streptomyces sp. nrrl 15496. the antibiotic complex is composed of two pairs of isomers with mw's of 752 and 766.  the individual isomers, which were separated by preparative hplc, equilibrate to  a mixture of the isomer pair when left in aqueous solution. in vitro, sb22484 antibiotics strongly inhibited neisseriae and were also active against streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == [etiology of cervicovaginal infection in pregnant and non-pregnant patients].
AB  == a prospective study to evaluate the prevalence of specific microorganisms in pregnant and nonpregnant women with cervicovaginitis attended at the instituto nacional de perinatologia, was done; candida sp, gardnerella vaginalis, replasma  urealitycum, chlamydia trachomatis, group b streptococcus, trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae were investigated. two hundred thirty four patients were studied, 105/234 (44.9%) pregnant and 129/234 (55.1%) nonpregnant women, with a mean age of 26.5 years (range 14 to 44 years). one hundred eighty one (77.5%) women had only one sexual partner. the most common microorganisms seen were candida sp (31.6%), gardnerella vaginalis (27.7) and ureaplasma urealyticum (15.8%). infection by chlamydia trachomatis was documented in 9.8% of the population. trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.7%, there was not any case  of neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. candida sp and ureaplasma urealyticum were founded more frequent in the pregnant women than nonpregnant women, 41.9% vs. 24.8% (p less than 0.01) and 20% vs. 12.4% (p less than 0.05) respectively. group b streptococci was isolated as a single agent in 4.8% in pregnant women. there were not found any pathogenic microorganisms in 29.9% of the cases, as a causal agent of symptomatic cervicovaginitis.

TI  == prevalence of low genital tract infectious agents in young israeli women.
AB  == low genital tract infectious agents were examined 411 times in 386 young women. each examination included anamnesis, physical examination and broad-spectrum microbiologic analysis for the detection of: ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, mycoplasma hominis, streptococcus beta hemolyticus group b, hemophilus vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and syphilis serology. three hundred and six patients were symptomatic for low genital tract infection and 80 were asymptomatic. most patients were young, 19.6 +/- 1.7 (sd) years old, single (84.7%) and sexually active (87.4%). u. urealyticum and c. trachomatis were the most common agents recovered in 43.9 and 40.8% of symptomatic patients, respectively. all agents were isolated more frequently in the symptomatic group, but statistically significant group comparisons were obtained only for candida sp. (p less than 0.001), t. vaginalis (p less than 0.005) and m. hominis (p less than 0.05). n. gonorrhoeae was isolated in only one case (0.3%), which may reflect technical difficulties or a true very low prevalence of this agent. clinical diagnoses of candidiasis and trichomoniasis in symptomatic patients were confirmed by laboratory results in only 34.9 and 54.9%, whereas negative clinical diagnoses were confirmed in 83.9 and 73.2%, respectively.
