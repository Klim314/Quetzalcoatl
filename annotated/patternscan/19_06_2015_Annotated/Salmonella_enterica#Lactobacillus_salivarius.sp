TI  == characterization of some potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from iranian native chickens.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to isolate, identify and characterize new  lab strains with high probiotic potentials from iranian (isfahan) indigenous chickens. from 90 isolated labs, 11 isolates had high growth rate under different stress conditions, including acid (ph 2.5), bile (0.5% oxgall), salt (6-15%) and  temperatures 15 and 45 degrees c, and their aggregation time was less than 120 min. based on the molecular identification using 16s rdna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the isolates belonged to two lactobacillus salivarius and  l. reuteri species. the isolates showed different tolerance to 16 clinically and  veterinary relevant antibiotics, and most of them were resistant to or semi-tolerant of 7-15 different studied antibiotics. the es11, es12, es3 and es13 strains with resistance to or semi-tolerance of 15, 14 and 13 different antibiotics, respectively, were the most tolerant strains. the selected isolates  showed a wide range of antimicrobial activity against 7 different pathogenic strains. all the isolates exhibited antagonistic activity against e. coli, enterococcus hirae, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus. the isolates es6 and es11 with high antagonistic activity and resistance against 6 of the studied pathogens were the most powerful antagonistic isolates. the values and types of adhesion to the caco-2 cell cultures were significantly different (0-40  bacteria/caco-2 cell), and the maximum adhesion was observed for the isolates es6 and es13 with 35 and 40 bacteria adhesion/cell, respectively. finally, based on all the experiments, 7 strains, including es1, es6, es7, es11, es12 and es13, were selected for the further in vivo assays and possible use in the poultry industry.

TI  == combining de novo and reference-guided assembly with scaffold_builder.
AB  == genome sequencing has become routine, however genome assembly still remains a challenge despite the computational advances in the last decade. in particular, the abundance of repeat elements in genomes makes it difficult to assemble them into a single complete sequence. identical repeats shorter than the average read  length can generally be assembled without issue. however, longer repeats such as  ribosomal rna operons cannot be accurately assembled using existing tools. the application scaffold_builder was designed to generate scaffolds - super contigs of sequences joined by n-bases - based on the similarity to a closely related reference sequence. this is independent of mate-pair information and can be used  complementarily for genome assembly, e.g. when mate-pairs are not available or have already been exploited. scaffold_builder was evaluated using simulated pyrosequencing reads of the bacterial genomes escherichia coli 042, lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhi str. p-stx-12. moreover, we sequenced two genomes from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 g455 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sdt1291 and show that scaffold_builder decreases the number of contig sequences by 53% while more  than doubling their average length. scaffold_builder is written in python and is  available at http://edwards.sdsu.edu/scaffold_builder. a web-based implementation is additionally provided to allow users to submit a reference genome and a set of contigs to be scaffolded.

TI  == adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
AB  == eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant  bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.

TI  == effect of immersion and inoculation in ovo of lactobacillus spp. in embryonated chicken eggs in the prevention of salmonella enteritidis after hatch.
AB  == the protection level against salmonella enteritidis was evaluated in chickens after in ovo treatment with different species of lactobacillus spp. inoculated into the air cell or by immersion in broth culture. two hundred forty embryonated eggs were distributed into 8 groups, corresponding to treatments with lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, and control. on d 18 of incubation, 4 groups were inoculated with 0.1 ml of inoculum  in the air cell and 4 groups were immersed for 3 min in culture of each treatment. two days after hatching, 0.5 ml of salmonella enteritidis culture was  inoculated by the intraesophageal route. on d 5 of life, the chicks were euthanized and the ceca were processed to obtain salmonella enteritidis counts. there was no decrease in salmonella enteritidis colonization of chick ceca, regardless of treatment or route of administration. lactobacillus spp. samples used in the treatment showed no probiotic potential in chicks when inoculated in  ovo, in relation to salmonella enteritidis inhibition in poultry ceca.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == pathogen translocation and histopathological lesions in an experimental model of  salmonella dublin infection in calves receiving lactic acid bacteria and lactose  supplements.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the capacity of a lactic acid bacteria  (lab) inoculum to protect calves with or without lactose supplements against salmonella dublin infection by evaluating histopathological lesions and pathogen  translocation. fifteen calves were divided into three groups [control group (c-g), a group inoculated with lab (lab-g), and a group inoculated with lab and given lactose supplements (l-lab-g)] with five, six, and four animals, respectively. the inoculum, composed of lactobacillus (l.) casei dspv 318t, l. salivarius dspv 315t, and pediococcus acidilactici dspv 006t, was administered with milk replacer. the lab-g and l-lab-g received a daily dose of 10(9) cfu/kg body weight of each strain throughout the experiment. lactose was provided to the l-lab-g in doses of 100 g/day. salmonella dublin (2 x 10(10) cfu) was orally administered to all animals on day 11 of the experiment. the microscopic lesion index values in target organs were 83%, 70%, and 64.3% (p < 0.05) for the c-g, lab-g, and l-lab-g, respectively. administration of the probiotic inoculum was not fully effective against infection caused by salmonella. although probiotic treatment was unable to delay the arrival of pathogen to target organs, it was evident that the inoculum altered the response of animals against pathogen infection.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == isolation and characterization of lactobacillus salivarius mtc 1026 as a potential probiotic.
AB  == researchers are becoming more interested in studying probiotics at present due to their benefit to human and animal health. in this study, newly isolated strains from human feces were evaluated for probiotic properties. a total of sixty isolated strains were collected from feces and six out of sixty isolated strains  could inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi and salmonella typhimurium. the strain which gave the best inhibitory effect was selected for further characterization as a probiotic strain. the identification of this strain was analyzed on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics and 16s rdna gene sequence. this strain was gram-positive, rod shaped, and catalase and oxidase-negative, and produced acids from d-glucose, d-fructose, lactose, mannitol, sorbitol, inulin and starch. it could not hydrolyze esculin or red blood cells. based on its 16s rdna gene sequence, it was lactobacillus salivarius, and so was called l. salivarius mtc 1026 in this study, and was closely related with l. salivarius dspv 344t isolated from the calf gut. it was able to survive in gastric and small intestinal juices at ph 2.0 and 1.0% bile salt for several hours and also could grow at 45 degrees c. moreover, this strain showed inhibitory activity against a variety of food-borne pathogens. it was highly sensitive to piperacillin, chloramphenicl, ampicillin, erythromycin and ceftazidime. after plasmid curing, this strain was susceptible to gentamicin, amikacin, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. l. salivarius mtc 1026 could significantly inhibit the adhesion process of e. coli atcc 25922 and s. typhimurium atcc 13311 on caco-2 monolayers in a competition assay and also reduced invasion of both pathogens (4-log cfu/ml) in an exclusion and displacement assay. therefore, it was clearly demonstrated in this study that l.  salivarius mtc 1026 has shown promising properties as a candidate for a potential probiotic for applications in humans and animals.

TI  == isolation of lactobacillus salivarius 1077 (nrrl b-50053) and characterization of its bacteriocin, including the antimicrobial activity spectrum.
AB  == lactobacillus salivarius 1077 (nrrl b-50053) was isolated from poultry intestinal materials, and in vitro anti-campylobacter jejuni activity was demonstrated. the  isolate was then used for bacteriocin production and its enrichment. the protein  content of the cell-free supernatant from the spent medium was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and dialyzed to produce the crude antimicrobial preparation. a typical bacteriocin-like response of sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes and resistance to lysozyme, lipase, and 100 degrees c was observed with this preparation. the polypeptide was further purified by gel filtration, ion-exchange, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), edman degradation, and isoelectrofocusing were used to characterize its 3,454-da molecular mass, the amino acid sequence of its 37 residue components, and the isoelectric point of pi 9.1 of the bacteriocin. bacteriocin l-1077 contained the  class iia bacteriocin signature n-terminal sequence ygngv. mics of bacteriocin l-1077 against 33 bacterial isolates (both gram negative and gram positive) ranged from 0.09 to 1.5 mug/ml. subsequently, the therapeutic benefit of bacteriocin l-1077 was demonstrated in market-age (40- to 43-day-old) broiler chickens colonized with both c. jejuni and salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis. compared with untreated control birds, both c. jejuni and s. enteritidis counts in colonized ceca were diminished by >4 log(10) and s. enteritidis counts in both the liver and the spleen of treated birds were reduced by 6 to 8 log(10)/g compared with those in the nontreated control birds. bacteriocin l-1077 appears to hold promise in controlling c. jejuni/s. enteritidis among commercial broiler chickens.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic bacteria on salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis in enterocyte-like caco-2 cells.
AB  == invasion of the gut by pathogenic salmonella leads to production of il-8 that initiates inflammatory reactions to combat the bacterium. however, its persistent production causes tissue damage and interventions that suppress il-8 production prevent tissue damage. we hypothesised that probiotics could mediate their benefits via inhibition of il-8 synthesis. caco-2 cells were infected with probiotic bifidobacterium infantis w52, lactobacillus casei w56, lactococcus lactis w58, lactobacillus acidophilus w70, bifidobacterium bifidum w23, or lactobacillus salivarius w24 or pathogenic salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis 857 at 0, 0.2, 1, 2, 10, 20, 100 or 200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell for 1 hour. cells were also exposed to a combination of one probiotic bacterium (200 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and the graded numbers of salmonella as either  co-incubation (1 hour) or pre-incubation of the probiotic bacterium (1 hour) followed by salmonella (1 hour). the cells recovered for 2 or 24 hours. il-8 and  hsp70 were determined by elisa and western blot respectively. both probiotics and salmonella induced a dose- and time-dependent synthesis of il-8 but probiotics induced far lower il-8 levels than salmonella. the salmonella-induced il-8 was significantly suppressed by b. infantis w52, l. casei w56 and l. lactis w58 at low numbers of salmonella (0.2 to 20 bacterial cells/caco-2 cell) and within 2 hours of recovery. the observed probiotic-mediated reduction in il-8 secretion was transient, and lost after a few hours. in addition, these three probiotics induced a significant increase in hsp70 expression while l. acidophilus w70, b. bifidum w23 and l. salivarius w24 induced a weak hsp70 expression and could not suppress the salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis. we conclude that suppression of salmonella-induced il-8 synthesis by caco-2 cells is exhibited by probiotics that induce expression of hsp70, suggesting that the protective role of probiotics could be mediated, at least in part, via hsp70 expression. this suppression is limited to a low number of infecting pathogenic salmonella.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
AB  == a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this  study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract  of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.

TI  == protective effect of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strain on infection with pathogenic bacteria in chickens.
AB  == the probiotic potential of a lactobacillus salivarius 3d strain isolated from chicken faeces was assessed in one day old chickens. lactobacillus salivarius 3d  was administered per os at a concentration of 10(8) cfu in 100 microl of pbs. the chickens were then challenged with pathogenic bacteria: salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni and clostridium perfringens. samples of caecal contents and  livers were collected after 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 days after infection. lactobacilli  and pathogenic bacterial cell counts were determined in the samples. this study showed that l. salivarius 3d reduced the number of salmonella enteritidis and clostridium perfringens in the group of chickens treated with lactobacillus. therefore it may be concluded that l. salivarius 3d may be used as a potential probiotic for chickens.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == detection of t lymphocytes in intestine of broiler chicks treated with lactobacillus spp. and challenged with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis.
AB  == the expression of immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by cd3+, cd4+, and cd8+ cells in the epithelium and in the intestinal lamina propria of chicks was studied in the present work by means of immunohistochemical reaction.  the chicks were treated with lactobacillus spp. or cecal microflora (cm) and experimentally challenged or not with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis. the 320 birds utilized were divided into 4 groups containing 80 chicks each and submitted to treatments with lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus, and cm. each group was subdivided into 4 subgroups of  20 birds each and classified into a subgroup that did not receive treatment (negative control), subgroup treated, subgroup treated and challenged with salmonella enteritidis, and subgroup only challenged with salmonella enteritidis  (positive control). the results obtained show that the treatment with l. reuteri, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, or cm and challenged or not with salmonella enteritidis determine immune response in the form of leukocytic infiltrate by cd3+ and cd8+ lymphocytes followed by cd4+ in the epithelium and in the lamina propria of the duodenum, jejunum, and cecum of chicks up to 12 d of age. the quantity of cd3+ lymphocytes was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the intestine of chicks treated with l. acidophilus or cm and challenged or not with salmonella enteritidis; however, the higher quantity of cd8+ lymphocytes was in the intestine of chicks treated with cm and challenged with salmonella enteritidis. the duodenum was the segment in which the immune response by t cells (cd3+, cd4+, and cd8+) was stimulated with the greatest intensity, followed by, respectively,  the jejunum and cecum. the quantity of cd3+ lymphocytes present in the duodenum,  jejunum, and cecum increases with the age of chicks, independent of the stimulus  determined by treatments or challenge.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition  was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic  potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.

TI  == a five-strain probiotic combination reduces pathogen shedding and alleviates disease signs in pigs challenged with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == salmonella spp. infection is a major cause of gastroenteritis, with many thousands of cases reported in the european union every year. the use of probiotics offers the potential to improve this situation. here, we investigate the effects of oral treatment of pigs with a defined lactic acid bacteria culture mixture on both clinical and microbiological signs of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection. fifteen weaned pigs blocked by sex and weight were administered control milk or a mixture of five probiotic strains as either a milk fermentate or milk suspension for a total of 30 days. the mixture consisted of two strains of lactobacillus murinus and one strain each of lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius, lactobacillus pentosus, and pediococcus pentosaceous. following probiotic administration for 6 days, animals were challenged orally with serovar typhimurium; the health of the animals and the microbiological composition of their feces were monitored for 23 days postinfection. animals treated with probiotic showed reduced incidence, severity, and duration of diarrhea. these animals also gained weight at a greater rate than control pigs administered skim milk. mean fecal numbers of salmonella were significantly reduced in probiotic-treated animals at 15 days postinfection (p =  0.01). the administered probiotic bacteria improved both the clinical and microbiological outcome of salmonella infection. these strains offer significant  benefit for use in the food industry and may have potential in human applications.

TI  == functional modulation of human intestinal epithelial cell responses by bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.
AB  == intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) and dendritic cells (dcs) play a pivotal role  in antigen sampling and the maintenance of gut homeostasis. however, the interaction of commensal bacteria with the intestinal surface remains incompletely understood. here we investigated immune cell responses to commensal  and pathogenic bacteria. ht-29 human iecs were incubated with bifidobacterium infantis 35624, lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 or salmonella typhimurium uk1 for varying times, or were pretreated with a probiotic for 2 hr prior to stimulation  with s. typhimurium or flagellin. gene arrays were used to examine inflammatory gene expression. nuclear factor (nf)-kappab activation, interleukin (il)-8 secretion, pathogen adherence to iecs, and mucin-3 (muc3) and e-cadherin gene expression were assayed by transam assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), fluorescence, and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr), respectively. il-10 and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha secretion by bacteria-treated peripheral blood-derived dcs were measured using elisa. s. typhimurium increased expression of 36 of the 847 immune-related genes  assayed, including nf-kappab and il-8. the commensal bacteria did not alter expression levels of any of the 847 genes. however, b. infantis and l. salivarius attenuated both il-8 secretion at baseline and s. typhimurium-induced pro-inflammatory responses. b. infantis also limited flagellin-induced il-8 protein secretion. the commensal bacteria did not increase muc3or e-cadherin expression, or interfere with pathogen binding to ht-29 cells, but they did stimulate il-10 and tnf-alpha secretion by dcs. the data demonstrate that, although the intestinal epithelium is immunologically quiescent when it encounters b. infantis or l. salivarius, these commensal bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on intestinal immune cells that mediate host responses to flagellin and enteric pathogens.

AB  == resident host microflora condition and prime the immune system. however, systemic and mucosal immune responses to bacteria may be divergent. our aim was to compare, in vitro, cytokine production by human mononuclear and dendritic cells (dcs) from mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) to defined microbial stimuli. mononuclear cells and dcs isolated from the mln (n = 10) and peripheral blood (n = 12) of patients with active colitis were incubated in vitro with the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus salivarius ucc118 or bifidobacterium infantis 35624 or the pathogenic organism salmonella typhimurium  uk1. interleukin (il)-12, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, transforming growth  factor (tgf)-beta, and il-10 cytokine levels were quantified by elisa. pbmcs and  pbmc-derived dcs secreted tnf-alpha in response to the lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, and salmonella strains, whereas mln cells and mln-derived dcs secreted tnf-alpha only in response to salmonella challenge. cells from the systemic compartment secreted il-12 after coincubation with salmonella or lactobacilli, whereas mln-derived cells produced il-12 only in response to salmonella. pbmcs secreted il-10 in response to the bifidobacterium strain but not in response to the lactobacillus or salmonella strain. however, mln cells secreted il-10 in response to bifidobacteria and lactobacilli but not in response to salmonella. in conclusion, commensal bacteria induced regulatory cytokine production by mln cells, whereas pathogenic bacteria induce t cell helper 1-polarizing cytokines. commensal-pathogen divergence in cytokine responses is more marked in cells isolated from the mucosal immune system compared with pbmcs.

TI  == selection of lactobacilli for chicken probiotic adjuncts.
AB  == during inhibitory activity screening of 296 strains of lactic acid bacteria from  the gastro-intestinal tract of chicks, 77 strains showed inhibition against enteric indicator strains (salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli). eight different strains identified as lactobacillus salivarius were selected for the following attributes: their ability to inhibit all the indicator strains; a high  adhesion efficiency to the epithelial cells of chickens and also their resistance to a number of antibiotics, monensin, bile salts and ph 3.0. the inhibitory action was not affected by the addition of catalase and no inhibition was detected after neutralizing the supernatant culture fluid. the competitiveness of the most promising strains, lact. salivarius ctc2183 and ctc2197, was assessed in chicken feed mixture and in vivo. it was concluded that both strains were capable of becoming predominant over the indigenous flora in the incubated chicken feed mixture. in vivo tests showed that lact. salivarius ctc2197 was able to colonize  and overcome lact. salivarius ctc2183 and the indigenous flora in the crop and caecum of the inoculated chicks.

TI  == lactobacillus flora in the cloaca and vagina of hens and its inhibitory activity  against salmonella enteritidis in vitro.
AB  == lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of 40 normal laying hens were investigated  quantitatively and qualitatively, and their ability to inhibit growth of salmonella enteritidis (se) was examined using a spot-the-lawn technique. all samples of cloacal contents and half the samples of vaginal mucus were positive for lactobacilli. the means +/- sd of total lactobacillus counts in the cloaca and those in the vagina were log10 5.5 +/- 1.1 and 2.5 +/- 2.6 cfu/g, respectively. in the cloaca, lactobacillus acidophilus was isolated from 92.5% of hens, and lactobacillus salivarius was isolated from 85.0% of hens, whereas lactobacillus fermentum was isolated from only one hen. in the vagina, l. acidophilus and l. salivarius were isolated from 42.5% of hens. in the inhibition assay in vitro, all strains of lactobacillus from cloacal contents and vaginal mucus inhibited growth of se. there was a wide range of the inhibitory activity even in the same species. no difference of the growth inhibition zone was observed between lactobacilli from cloaca and those from vagina. the present study suggested that lactobacilli in the cloaca and vagina of hens might have a protective effect against se colonization.

TI  == lactobacillus salivarius ctc2197 prevents salmonella enteritidis colonization in  chickens.
AB  == a rifampin-resistant lactobacillus salivarius strain, ctc2197, was assessed as a  probiotic in poultry, by studying its ability to prevent salmonella enteritidis c-114 colonization in chickens. when the probiotic strain was dosed by oral gavage together with s. enteritidis c-114 directly into the proventriculus in 1-day-old leghorn chickens, the pathogen was completely removed from the birds after 21 days. the same results were obtained when the probiotic strain was also  administered through the feed and the drinking water apart from direct inoculation into the proventriculus. the inclusion of l. salivarius ctc2197 in the first day chicken feed revealed that a concentration of 10(5) cfu g(-1) was enough to ensure the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract of the birds after 1 week. however, between 21 and 28 days, l. salivarius ctc2197 was undetectable in the gastrointestinal tract of some birds, showing that more than  one dose would be necessary to ensure its presence till the end of the rearing time. freeze-drying and freezing with glycerol or skim milk as cryoprotective agents, appeared to be suitable methods to preserve the probiotic strain. the inclusion of the l. salivarius ctc2197 in a commercial feed mixture seemed to be  a good way to supply it on the farm, although the strain showed sensitivity to the temperatures used during the feed mixture storage and in the chicken incubator rooms. moreover, survival had been improved after several reinoculations in chicken feed mixture.

TI  == inhibition of salmonella typhimurium attachment to chicken cecal mucus by intestinal isolates of enterobacteriaceae and lactobacilli.
AB  == the ability of selected strains of enterobacteriaceae or lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of adult chickens to inhibit in vitro attachment of salmonella typhimurium 3333/o to cecal mucus in the presence or absence of d-mannose was determined. attachment in the absence of mannose was reduced by prior exposure of mucus to cultures of two isolates of enterobacteriaceae, an escherichia coli and a hafnia alvei strain, but not to a third isolate, an enterobacter agglomerans strain. attachment of s. typhimurium was not inhibited when mannose was present in the blocking or attachment step. formation of fimbriae by the two inhibitory enterobacteriaceae strains and the s. typhimurium  strain, as indicated by titers of mannose-sensitive hemagglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes was optimal in z biphasic medium (consisting of tryptone, yeast  extract, dextrose, and nacl) incubated anaerobically at 42 c. fimbriae of each of three strains prepared from these cultures also inhibited attachment. these are characteristics consistent with attachment and inhibition of attachment mediated  by a mannose-sensitive adhesin associated with type 1 fimbriae on bacterial cells of enterobacteriaceae strains. attachment in the presence of mannose was significantly reduced by prior exposure of mucus to cultures of a lactobacillus salivarius strain and a lactobacillus delbrueckii delbrueckii strain but not to a strain of lactobacillus for which the species had not been determined. washed cells or spent culture supernatant fluid from brain-heart infusion broth, z broth, or z biphasic cultures of the inhibitory strains of lactobacilli incubated at 37 or 42 c inhibited this form of attachment. of 27 intestinal isolates of enterobacteriaceae and 21 of lactobacilli, the lactobacilli strains were generally more hydrophobic than the enterobacteriaceae as determined by adherence to hexadecane. the lactobacilli isolates did not agglutinate guinea pig erythrocytes. the data suggest more than one mechanism for mediating attachment of inhibitory bacterial strains and for subsequent attachment of s. typhimurium.

TI  == antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB  == yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. we recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (dmab) (mutation res. (1995) 334, 213-224). we are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against mnng.
