TI  == antibacterial activity of human defensins on anaerobic intestinal bacterial species: a major role of hbd-3.
AB  == defensins are natural mucosal antimicrobial peptides and their broad spectrum activity against aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria has been well investigated. the aim of this study was to systematically examine the antibacterial activity of the small intestinal paneth cell derived alpha-defensin hd5 and the major colonic beta-defensins hbd-1-3 against strict anaerobic intestinal bacteria. the antibacterial activity was assessed with a flow cytometric assay employing a membrane potential sensitive dye as marker for loss  of cell viability. the majority of the tested strains belonging to the dominant anaerobe genera of the gut, bacteroides and parabacteroides, were only minimally  affected by the constitutively expressed defensins hd5 and hbd-1. the inducible defensin hbd-2 had a limited antibacterial effect, whereas the inducible hbd-3 exhibited potent activity against most strains. the effect of hbd-3 on bacteroides sp. appeared to be dependent on the presence of oxygen. bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from blood during bacteremia or from extraintestinal infections were more resistant to hbd-3 than strains from the physiological gut flora. thus, defensin resistance is not only species- but also strain-specific and may be clinically relevant in the host-bacteria interaction influencing mucosal translocation and systemic infection.
