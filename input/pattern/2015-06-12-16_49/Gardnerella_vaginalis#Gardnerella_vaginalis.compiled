TI  - The sactibiotic subclass of bacteriocins: an update.
AB  - The sactibiotics are a recently designated subclass of bacteriocins that contain  characteristic cysteine thiol to alpha-carbon linkages as post-translational modification. They are a relatively small subclass of bacteriocins compared to the most thoroughly studied lantibiotics. The sactibiotics that have been extensively studied thus far are thuricin CD, subtilosin A, thurincin H, and propionicin F. Despite their recent discovery, there have already been significant advances made in the study of sactibiotics, most notably the discovery of the narrow spectrum anti-Clostridium difficile sactibiotic, thuricin CD. In addition, scientists have gained insights into the mechanisms of action of the sactibiotic subtilosin A, which targets Listeria monocytogenes, Gardnerella vaginalis, and other pathogens. Also, the development of heterologous host systems and homologous expression and site-directed mutagenesis systems for the sactibiotic thurincin H have opened up many opportunities for further studies on this sactibiotic. These and other recent studies concerning the molecular biology, 3D structural elucidation, mode of action, self-protection mechanisms, and antimicrobial spectrum of the sactibiotic subgroup of bacteriocins are discussed in this review.
TI  - Prevalence of the genital tract bacterial infections after vaginal reconstructive surgery.
AB  - Due to frequent childbirth, heavy lifting and the structure of the lives of rural women in Shahrekord region, Iran, cystocele and rectocele are of the main medical problems of the women in this area and for its correction, vaginal reconstructive surgery is needed which causes infection. The purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria causing infection after vaginal reconstructive surgery and performing antibiogram to help these patients for faster recovery. Patients enrolled this study were 92 who had undergone previous vaginal reconstructive surgery and now had infection. After examination, the group of patients taking antibiotics (n = 26) were excluded and the remaining 66 completed the study questionnaire. A gynecologist performed sampling; related tests (aerobic and anaerobic culture using an anaerobic culture gas pack jar and type A which provides absolute anaerobic conditions) were performed; antimicrobial susceptibility testing using Disk Diffusion Method was carried out; and the results were recorded. All the positive samples were polymicrobial. Gardnerella vaginalis in 20 cases (31%), peptostreptococci and anaerobic cocci in 9 cases (13.6%), staphylococcus aureus in 8 cases (9.1%), bacteroides and fusobacterium in 7 cases (10.6%), streptococcus group B in 4 cases (6%), yeast cells in 11 cases (16.6%) and Trichomonas vaginalis in wet mount of 4 (6%) existed. Anaerobic bacteria showed 85% sensitivity to clindamycin, 82% to chloramphenicol, 85% sensitivity to ceftizoxime and 45% to penicillin. Facultative anaerobic bacteria showed a sensitivity rate of 90% to ceftizoxime, chloramphenicol and cephalothin. According to our findings, the rate of vaginal bacterial infection in women with vaginal reconstructive surgery has increased; from which, infections with anaerobic bacteria origins have increased dramatically. We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis prior to genital reconstructive surgeries.
TI  - Prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogens associated with HPV infection in cervical samples in a Mexican population.
AB  - Cervical cancer development has been mainly associated with persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. However, HPV infection is unlikely to be sufficient to cause cervical cancer, and the contribution of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) could be the determining factor for cervical lesion-progression. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of STIs associated with HPV-positivity in 201 cervical samples from patients who underwent annual routine gynecological exams. The overall prevalence of STIs was 57.7%, and the most frequent infection was Ureaplasma spp (UP) (39.8%), followed by Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) (25.9%), alpha-HPV (18.4%), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) (1.5%), and Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) (0.5%). The highest prevalence rate of multiple non-HPV infections was observed for the age-range 31-40; for papillomavirus infection, the age-range was 21-30. In normal cervical samples, HPV16 was the most prevalent genotype (24.3%), followed by genotypes 58 (13.5%) and 52 (10.8%). Intriguingly, HPV18 was not detected in the study population, and genotypes 52 and 58 were found exclusively in samples with abnormal cytology. Papillomavirus infection with oncogenic types was significantly associated with GV (P = 0.025) and strongly associated with multiple non-HPV pathogens (P = 0.002). The following variables correlated significantly with cytological diagnosis of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL): GV (P = 0.028), multiple non-HPV infections (P = 0.001), and high-risk HPV positivity (P = 0.001). Epidemiological data from this study will contribute to the molecular detection of sexually transmitted pathogens from screening programs to identify those women who are at risk for developing cervical lesions.

TI  - Cervical microbiota in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cervical microbiota in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) by pyrosequencing and to document associations between cervical microbiota, cervical inflammatory response, microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), histological chorioamnionitis, and intraamniotic infection (IAI). STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-one women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM were included in the study. Specimens of cervical and amniotic fluid were collected on admission. The cervical microbiota was assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing by pyrosequencing. Interleukin (IL)-6 concentration in the cervical fluid and amniotic fluid was measured by ELISA and lateral flow immunoassay, respectively. RESULTS: Four bacterial community state types [CST I (Lactobacillus crispatus dominated), CST III (Lactobacillus iners dominated), CST IV-A (non-Lactobacillus bacteria dominated), and CST IV-B (Gardnerella vaginalis and Sneathia sanguinegens dominated)] were observed in the cervical microbiota of women with PPROM. Cervical fluid IL-6 concentrations differed between CSTs (CST I = 145 pg/mL, CST III = 166 pg/mL, CST IV-A = 420 pg/mL, and CST IV-B = 322 pg/mL; p = 0.004). There were also differences in the rates of MIAC, of both MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis, and of IAI among CSTs. No difference in the rate of histological chorioamnionitis was found among CSTs. CONCLUSIONS: The cervical microbiota in PPROM women in this study was characterized by four CSTs. The presence of non-Lactobacillus CSTs was associated with a strong cervical inflammatory response and higher rates of MIAC, both MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis, and IAI representing a PPROM subtype with pronounced inflammation. CST I represents the dominant type of PPROM with a low rate of MIAC, IAI, and the combination of MIAC and histological chorioamnionitis.
TI  - Role of Gardnerella vaginalis as an etiological agent of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bacterial vaginosis is a risk factor for obstetric infections, various adverse outcomes of pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in women attending Gynaecology Outpatient Department (O.P.D) and sexually transmitted disease (S.T.D.) clinic and to assess the role of Gardnerella vaginalis as an etiological agent of bacterial vaginosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred women attending Gynaecology O.P.D and S.T.D. clinic with symptoms suggesting lower genital tract infection were included in the study. pH of the vaginal discharge was measured and three high vaginal swabs were collected. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed using Amsel's criteria and Nugent's method. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated and identified by standard methods. RESULTS: Prevalence of bacterial vaginosis using Amsel's criteria and Gram stain scoring method was found to be 51.5% and 49% respectively. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in only 8.7% cases of bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a relatively high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in the population under study. Women attending various healthcare facilities should be screened and treated properly to prevent recurrence. Low isolation rate of Gardnerella vaginalis may be attributed to factors like poor viability and fastidiousness of the organism to grow in various media.
TI  - Severe pelvic abscess formation following caesarean section.
AB  - We report a case of a 24-year-old woman with severe pelvic abscess formation 2 weeks after secondary caesarean section. The isolated pathogens were a mixture of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. After initial resistance to systemic antibiotic treatment, she underwent radiologically-guided drainage of the abscesses, whereon she had a continuous recovery.
TI  - Diagnosing inflammation and infection in the urinary system via proteomics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current methodology for the diagnosis of diseases in the urinary system includes patient symptomology, urine analysis and urine culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria from urethral colonization or indwelling catheters, sample contamination from perineal or vaginal sources, and non-infectious inflammatory conditions can mimic UTIs, leading to uncertainty on medical treatment decisions. METHODS: Innovative shotgun metaproteomic methods were used to analyze urine sediments from 120 patients also subjected to conventional urinalysis for various clinical reasons including suspected UTIs. The proteomic data were simultaneously searched for the presence of microbial agents, inflammation, immune responses against pathogens, and evidence of urothelial tissue injury. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to identify host protein patterns discerning UTI from urethral colonization and vaginal contamination of urine samples. RESULTS: Organisms causing more than 98% of all UTIs and commensal microbes of the urogenital and perineal area were identified from 76 urine sediments with detection sensitivities estimated to be similar to urine culture. Proteomic data permitted a thorough evaluation of inflammatory and antimicrobial immune responses. Hierarchical clustering of the data revealed that high abundances of proteins from activated neutrophils were associated with pathogens in most cases, and correlated well with leukocyte esterase activities and leukocyte counts via microscopy. Proteomic data also allowed assessments of urothelial injury, by quantifying proteins highly expressed in red blood cells and contributing to the acute phase response. Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis were frequently identified suggesting urethral colonization and/or vaginal contamination of urine. CONCLUSIONS: A metaproteomic approach of interest for routine urine clinical diagnostics is presented. As compared to urinalysis and urine culture methods, the data are derived from a single experiment for a given sample and provide additional insights into presence or absence of inflammatory responses and vaginal contamination of urine specimens.
TI  - Prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma hominis in urogenital tract of Brazilian women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of Mycoplasma hominis and M. genitalium in urogenital tract  infections remains unknown. Furthermore these mollicutes present a complex relationship with the host immune response. The role of inflammatory cytokines in infections also makes them good candidates to investigate bacterial vaginosis and mycoplasma genital infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect the above-mentioned mollicutes by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) methodologies in vaginal swabs and dosage of cytokines. METHODS: Vaginal swabs and peripheral blood were collected from 302 women, including healthy individuals. The molecular findings were correlated with some individual behavioral variables, clinical and demographic characteristics, presence of other important microorganisms in vaginal swabs, and levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6. RESULTS: M. hominis and M. genitalium were detected in 31.8% and 28.1% of samples, respectively. The qPCR results were associated with clinical signs and symptoms of the infections studied. The frequency of Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis was 3.0%, 21.5%, 42.4%, and 1.7% respectively. Increased levels of IL-1beta were associated with the presence of M. hominis and signs and/or symptoms of the genital infection of women studied. CONCLUSION: IL-1beta production was associated with the detection of M. hominis by qPCR. The sexual behavior of women studied was associated with the detection of mycoplasma and other agents of genital infections.
TI  - The significance of Lactobacillus crispatus and L. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of African women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women in sub-Saharan Africa are vulnerable to acquiring HIV infection and reproductive tract infections. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a disruption of the vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with HIV infection. Risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are not known. METHODS: We present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the Lactobacillus genus, five Lactobacillus species, and three BV-related bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Prevotella bivia) together with Escherichia coli and Candida albicans in 426 African women across different groups at risk for HIV. We selected a reference group of adult HIV-negative women at average risk for HIV acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, HIV-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of HIV-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. We explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with BV by Nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. RESULTS: The presence of species across Kenyan, South African and Rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in Kenya and South Africa. The Rwandan sex workers and HIV-positive women had the highest G. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). Pregnant women had a higher Lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). L. vaginalis (43%) was second to L. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal Nugent score. Recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of L. crispatus (<0.001), L. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and Lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). Having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of G. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and L. iners (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although the composition of species across the studied African countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. L. crispatus and L. vaginalis in women with a normal Nugent score appeared lower compared to non-African studies. Furthermore, Lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. Strategies to support protective Lactobacillus species are urgently needed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered at the Trial Registration at the National Health Research Ethics Council South Africa with the number DOH2709103223.
TI  - Complementary seminovaginal microbiome in couples.
AB  - The genital tract microbiome is tightly associated with reproductive health. Although many research studies have been performed on the vaginal microbiome, current knowledge of the male microbiome is scarce, and parallel studies examining couples are extremely rare. In this work, we aimed to compare seminal and vaginal microbiomes in couples and to assess the influence of sexual intercourse on vaginal microbiome. The study included 23 couples. Microbiomes of semen and vaginal fluid (pre- and post-intercourse) were profiled using Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing of the V6 region of 16S rRNA gene. Seminal communities were significantly more diverse, but with lower total bacterial concentrations than those of the vagina. Gardnerella vaginalis was predominant in half of the women whose partners had significant leukocytospermia, but only in one of 17 women who had a partner without leukocytospermia. There was significant decrease in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus crispatus after intercourse, and high concordance between semen and vaginal samples. Our data support the hypothesis that semen and vaginal microbiomes are in association, inasmuch as the predominance of G. vaginalis in female partners was significantly related to inflammation in male genital tracts.
TI  - Complete Genome Sequence of Gardnerella vaginalis Strain JCM 11026T, Isolated from Vaginal Tracts of Women.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis strain JCM 11026(T) was isolated from vaginal tracts of women. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of this organism.
TI  - Natural antimicrobials subtilosin and lauramide arginine ethyl ester synergize with conventional antibiotics clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of Gardnerella vaginalis but not against biofilms of healthy vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of clindamycin and metronidazole to synergize with natural antimicrobials against biofilms of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated Gardnerella vaginalis. Minimum bactericidal concentrations for biofilm cells (MBCs-B) were determined for each antimicrobial. The MBCs-B of lauramide arginine ethyl ester (LAE), subtilosin, clindamycin and metronidazole were 50, 69.5, 20 and 500 mug mL(-1), respectively. A checkerboard assay and isobologram were used to analyze the type of interactions between these antimicrobials. The combination of metronidazole with natural antimicrobials did not inhibit planktonic lactobacilli. Clindamycin with either LAE or with subtilosin was inhibitory for planktonic but not for biofilm-associated lactobacilli. All tested antimicrobial combinations were inhibitory for BV-associated Mobiluncus curtisii and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. LAE and subtilosin synergized with clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of G. vaginalis but not biofilm-associated vaginal lactobacilli. The biofilms of BV-associated pathogens can be controlled by synergistically acting combinations of conventional antibiotics and natural antimicrobials which will help better management of current antibiotics, especially considering robust bacterial resistance. Our findings create a foundation for a new strategy in the effective control of vaginal infections.
TI  - Vaginal microbiota of adolescent girls prior to the onset of menarche resemble those of reproductive-age women.
AB  - Puberty is an important developmental stage wherein hormonal shifts mediate the physical and physiological changes that lead to menarche, but until now, the bacterial composition of vaginal microbiota during this period has been poorly characterized. We performed a prospective longitudinal study of perimenarcheal girls to gain insight into the timing and sequence of changes that occur in the vaginal and vulvar microbiota during puberty. The study enrolled 31 healthy, premenarcheal girls between the ages of 10 and 12 years and collected vaginal and vulvar swabs quarterly for up to 3 years. Bacterial composition was characterized by Roche 454 pyrosequencing and classification of regions V1 to V3 of 16S rRNA genes. Contrary to expectations, lactic acid bacteria, primarily Lactobacillus spp., were dominant in the microbiota of most girls well before the onset of menarche in the early to middle stages of puberty. Gardnerella vaginalis was detected at appreciable levels in approximately one-third of subjects, a notable finding considering that this organism is commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis in adults. Vulvar microbiota closely resembled vaginal microbiota but often exhibited additional taxa typically associated with skin microbiota. Our findings suggest that the vaginal microbiota of girls begin to resemble those of adults well before the onset of menarche. IMPORTANCE: This study addresses longitudinal changes in vaginal and vulvar microbial communities prior to and immediately following menarche. The research is significant because microbial ecology of the vagina is an integral aspect of health, including resistance to infections. The physiologic changes of puberty and initiation of cyclic menstruation are likely to have profound effects on vaginal microbiota, but almost nothing is known about changes that normally occur during this time. Our understanding has been especially hampered by the lack of thorough characterization of microbial communities using techniques that do not rely on the cultivation of fastidious bacteria, as well as a dearth of studies on girls in the early to middle stages of puberty. This study improves our understanding of the normal development of vaginal microbiota during puberty and onset of menarche and may better inform clinical approaches to vulvovaginal care of adolescent girls.
TI  - [Semen quality and its influencing factors in preconception males in Nanjing area].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the semen quality and its influencing factors in preconception males in Nanjing area so as to provide some evidence for working out effective intervention measures. METHODS: Totally 687 men receiving preconceptional physical examination were enrolled in this study. A questionnaire survey was conducted among the subjects along with an analysis of their semen quality. RESULTS: The median of sperm concentration was 63.3 x 10(6)/ml (95% CI [19.88-119] x 10(6)/ml). The median of grade a sperm was 33.03% (95% CI [19.38-55.05]%), that of grade a + b sperm was 52.08% (95% CI [39.53-69.37]%), and that of teratosperm was 91.75% (95% CI [69-100]%). The median concentration of seminal plasma PMN-elastase was 195.55 ng/ml (95% CI [76.16-3330.38] ng/ml) and that of seminal plasma zinc was 7.62 mumol/L (95% CI [1.5-23, 45] mumol/L). The positive rates of Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) were 42.4%, 0.3%, and 2.4%, respectively. The median of sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) of those whose wives had a history of adverse pregnancy was 20.25% (95% CI [2.15-68.25]%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that mental stress (OR 1.567, 95% CI [1.081-2.27]) and sedentariness (OR 1.772, 95% CI [1.211-2.592]) were independent risk factors for asthenospermia. CONCLUSION: The sperm quality of preconception males in Nanjing area is not encouraging, and it can be improved by changing undesirable lifestyle and reducing mental stress.
TI  - The association of uterine cervical microbiota with an increased risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in Korea.
AB  - Recent studies have suggested potential roles of the microbiome in cervicovaginal diseases. However, there has been no report on the cervical microbiome in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We aimed to identify the cervical microbiota of Korean women and assess the association between the cervical microbiota and CIN, and to determine the combined effect of the microbiota and human papillomavirus (HPV) on the risk of CIN. The cervical microbiota of 70 women with CIN and 50 control women was analysed using pyrosequencing based on the 16S rRNA gene. The associations between specific microbial patterns or abundance of specific microbiota and CIN risk were assessed using multivariate logistic regression, and the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and the synergy index (S) were calculated. The phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Tenericutes, Fusobacteria and TM7 were predominant in the microbiota and four distinct community types were observed in all women. A high score of the pattern characterized by predominance of Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus iners with a minority of Lactobacillus crispatus had a higher CIN risk (OR 5.80, 95% CI 1.7319.4) and abundance of A. vaginae had a higher CIN risk (OR 6.63, 95% CI 1.6127.2). The synergistic effect of a high score of this microbial pattern and oncogenic HPV was observed (OR 34.1, 95% CI 4.95284.5; RERI/S, 15.9/1.93). A predominance of A. vaginae, G. vaginalis and L. iners with a concomitant paucity of L. crispatus in the cervical microbiota was associated with CIN risk, suggesting that bacterial dysbiosis and its combination with oncogenic HPV may be a risk factor for cervical neoplasia.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by a new multiplex peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization method.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of most common vaginal infections. However, its diagnosis by classical methods reveals low specificity. Our goal was to evaluate the accuracy diagnosis of 150 vaginal samples with research gold standard methods and our Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) probes by Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) methodology. Also, we described the first PNA-FISH methodology for BV diagnosis, which provides results in approximately 3 h. The results showed a sensitivity of 84.6% (95% confidence interval (CI), from 64.3 to 95.0%) and a specificity of 97.6% (95% CI [92.6-99.4%]), demonstrating the higher specificity of the PNA-FISH method and showing false positive results in BV diagnosis commonly obtained by the classical methods. This methodology combines the specificity of PNA probes for Lactobacillus species and G. vaginalis visualization and the calculation of the microscopic field by Nugent score, allowing a trustful evaluation of the bacteria present in vaginal microflora and avoiding the occurrence of misleading diagnostics. Therefore, the PNA-FISH methodology represents a valuable alternative for BV diagnosis.
TI  - Clinical chorioamnionitis at term I: microbiology of the amniotic cavity using cultivation and molecular techniques.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the amniotic fluid (AF) microbiology of patients with the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis at term using both cultivation and molecular techniques; and 2) to examine the relationship between intra-amniotic inflammation with and without microorganisms and placental lesions consistent with acute AF infection. METHODS: The AF samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 46 women with clinical signs of chorioamnionitis at term were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anerobic bacteria as well as genital mycoplasmas) and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS). The frequency of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC), intra-amniotic inflammation [defined as an AF interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration >/=2.6 ng/mL], and placental lesions consistent with acute AF infection (acute histologic chorioamnionitis and/or acute funisitis) were examined according to the results of AF cultivation and PCR/ESI-MS as well as AF IL-6 concentrations. RESULTS: 1) Culture identified bacteria in AF from 46% (21/46) of the participants, whereas PCR/ESI-MS was positive for microorganisms in 59% (27/46) - combining these two tests, microorganisms were detected in 61% (28/46) of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term. Eight patients had discordant test results; one had a positive culture and negative PCR/ESI-MS result, whereas seven patients had positive PCR/ESI-MS results and negative cultures. 2) Ureaplasma urealyticum (n=8) and Gardnerella vaginalis (n=10) were the microorganisms most frequently identified by cultivation and PCR/ESI-MS, respectively. 3) When combining the results of AF culture, PCR/ESI-MS and AF IL-6 concentrations, 15% (7/46) of patients did not have intra-amniotic inflammation or infection, 6.5% (3/46) had only MIAC, 54% (25/46) had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, and 24% (11/46) had intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms. 4) Placental lesions consistent with acute AF infection were significantly more frequent in patients with microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation [70.8% (17/24) vs. 28.6% (2/7); P=0.04]. CONCLUSION: Microorganisms in the AF were identified in 61% of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term; 54% had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, whereas 24% had intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms.
TI  - Rapid and Profound Shifts in the Vaginal Microbiota Following Antibiotic Treatment for Bacterial Vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common polymicrobial disease associated with numerous negative reproductive health outcomes, including an increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus acquisition. BV is treatable with antibiotics, but relapse is common. A more detailed understanding of bacterial dynamics during antibiotic therapy for BV could identify conditions that favor establishment, maintenance, and eradication of BV-associated bacterial species, thereby improving treatment outcomes. METHODS: We used mathematical models to analyze daily quantitative measurements of 11 key bacterial species during metronidazole treatment for 15 cases of BV. RESULTS: We identified complete reorganization of vaginal bacterial composition within a day of initiating therapy. Although baseline bacterial levels predicted a longer time to clearance, all anaerobic species were eliminated rapidly within a median of 3 days. However, reemergence of BV-associated species was common following treatment cessation. Gardnerella vaginalis, a facultative anaerobe, was cleared more slowly than anaerobic BV-associated species, and levels of G. vaginalis often rebounded during treatment. We observed gradual Lactobacillus species growth, indicating that untargeted microbes fill the transient vacuum formed during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Under antibiotic pressure, the human microbiome can undergo rapid shifts on a scale of hours. When treatment is stopped, BV-associated bacteria quickly reemerge, suggesting a possible role for intermittent prophylactic treatment.
TI  - Establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR.
AB  - Ten specific primer sets, for Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, Chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and Bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy Japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: Lactobacilli such as L. crispatus, L. gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as Streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. Certain bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related bacteria, such as G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. curtisii, and Prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. Especially in one subject, both G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic BV patient. These results suggest that the RT-qPCR system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.
TI  - [Condition of periodontal tissue in women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Cross colonization of open cavities of human body has little been studied in contemporary medicine. There in no practical recommendations as for management of dental patients with urogenital tract microflora disorder. The paper presents the findings of clinical features of periodontium tissues in women with bacterial vaginosis correlated with bacteriological estimation of oral cavity and vagina, number of sexual partners. Interpretation of amine test of oral and vaginal fluids has been provided for the first time. Chronic generalized inflammatory and inflammatory-dystrophic periodontal diseases of different severity have been detected in all female patients with gynecological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Gardnerella vaginalis, which is atypical representative of oral cavity microflora, has been detected by the PCR method in bacterial vaginosis both in vagina and oral cavity. The major markers of bacterial vaginosis have been also detected in oral cavity in women with this pathology.
TI  - The cytolytic activity of vaginolysin strictly depends on cholesterol and is potentiated by human CD59.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis produces cytolysin vaginolysin (VLY), which has been suggested to be a contributor to bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis. VLY along with intermedilysin (ILY) from Streptococcus intermedius have been attributed to a group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) whose pore-forming activity depends on human CD59 (hCD59). Here, we show that different types of cells lacking hCD59 are susceptible to VLY-mediated lysis, albeit to different extents. We analyze the effects of both hCD59 and cholesterol on VLY cytolytic activity. We show that VLY binds to cholesterol-rich membranes of non-human cells, while VLY with an impaired cholesterol recognition site retains binding to the hCD59-containing cells. We further demonstrate that cholesterol binding by VLY is sufficient to trigger the formation of oligomeric complexes on cholesterol rich-liposomes lacking hCD59. Thus, VLY may induce cell lysis following two alternative pathways. One requires only cholesterol and does not depend on hCD59. The second pathway involves hCD59 contribution similarly to ILY. Apparently, under physiological conditions VLY acts in the most effective way by accepting the assistance of hCD59.
TI  - The Natural Antimicrobial Subtilosin A Synergizes with Lauramide Arginine Ethyl Ester (LAE), epsilon-Poly-L-lysine (Polylysine), Clindamycin Phosphate and Metronidazole, Against the Vaginal Pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. BV is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately Lactobacillus to a multispecies Actinomyces biofilm with the most common representatives identified as Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella spp. Current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. The objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against G. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. The four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-L-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin A. The use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. The microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these MICs in combination. Clindamycin and subtilosin (CS), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against G. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). All tested combinations were found to have Bliss synergy. The combination of clindamycin and polylysine (CP) was identified as antagonistic against L. acidophilus in terms of both FICI and Bliss synergy. The combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (CM) was antagonistic against L. vaginalis for both FICI and Bliss synergy. The combinations of CP, clindamycin and LAE, CS, and LAE and polylysine were identified as Bliss antagonistic against L. vaginalis but did not indicate FICI antagonism.
TI  - Performance evaluation of a DNA chip assay in the identification of major genitourinary pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the recurrence of genitourinary infections and to reduce the risks of their complications, accurate and rapid diagnosis are required. STDetect(R) Chip is a DNA chip which allows for the simultaneous detection of 13 major genitourinary pathogens in a single vaginal swab or urine specimen. We evaluated the analytical performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for detecting target pathogens that commonly cause genitourinary infections. METHODS: The target pathogens of the STDetect(R) Chip are Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. Performance of the STDetect(R) Chip for the detection of target pathogens was evaluated comparing with the result of direct sequencing and conventional multiplex PCR assay. And precision tests for STDetect(R) Chip were performed with quality control materials. RESULTS: The STDetect(R) Chip showed high sensitivities (95.1%-100%), specificities (93.4% to 100%), concordance rates (95.0%-100%), positive predictive values (69.8%-100%), and negative predictive values (93.1%-100%) in its identification of 13 target pathogens. The STDetect(R) Chip had a particularly excellent concordance rate (96.5%) for the 4 major pathogens, C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and U. urealyticum, compared with direct sequencing. Comparing to multiplex PCR assay, STDetect(R) Chip showed better sensitivity for detecting M. hominis (97.0% vs. 54.5%) and U. urealyticum (93.2% vs. 65.9%). In precision tests, coefficients of variations for signal intensities were ranged from 11.2% to 26.2%. CONCLUSION: The STDetect(R) Chip showed excellent analytical performance, and its result was in good agreement with that obtained by direct sequencing.
TI  - Colonization of the upper genital tract by vaginal bacterial species in nonpregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the upper genital tract (UGT) presence of vaginal bacterial species using sensitive molecular methods capable of detecting fastidious bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal swabs were collected prior to hysterectomy. The excised uterus was sterilely opened and swabs collected from the endometrium and upper endocervix. DNA was tested in 11 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for 12 bacterial species: Lactobacillus iners, L crispatus, L jensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera spp, Prevotella spp, Leptotrichia/Sneathia, BVAB1, BVAB2, BVAB3, and a broad-range16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene assay. Endometrial fluid was tested with Luminex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines and defensins and tissue for gene expression of defensins and cathelicidin. RESULTS: We enrolled 58 women: mean aged 43 +/- 7 years, mostly white (n = 46; 79%) and BV negative (n = 43; 74%). By species-specific quantitative PCR, 55 (95%) had UGT colonization with at least 1 species (n = 52) or were positive by 16S PCR (n = 3). The most common species were L iners (45% UGT, 61% vagina), Prevotella spp (33% UGT, 76% vagina) and L crispatus (33% UGT, 56% vagina). Median quantities of bacteria in the UGT were lower than vaginal levels by 2-4 log10 ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene copies per swab. There were no differences in the endometrial inflammatory markers between women with no bacteria, Lactobacillus only, or any BV-associated species in the UGT. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the endometrial cavity is not sterile in most women undergoing hysterectomy and that the presence of low levels of bacteria in the uterus is not associated with significant inflammation.
TI  - [Risk factors for bacterial vaginosis - a 3-year study in four medical centers].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common infection of the lower genital tract among women of reproductive age. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of BV and the important etiological agent Gardnerella vaginalis in Bulgarian patients of different age groups, as well as, the risk factors forBV METHODS: One thousand five hundred and twenty-three (1523) women aged 16 to 45 years without previous antimicrobial therapy were included in this study. The methods used were: scoring of Gram staining of vaginal smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for G. vaginalis. RESULTS: Positive for BV according to the microscopic examination criteria were 47.80% from the 1523 tested women. In 88.87% from the positive samples G. vaginalis was detected using PCR, thus demonstrating high comparability of the both methods and the leading role of G. vaginalis. The most affected with BV is the age group of 21-25 years (33.21% of all subjects with BV). The most important detected risk factors were: smoking (more than 55% with BV), single marital status (only 15% with BV are married), more than I sexual partner (more than 36% had changed the sexual partner), early onset of sexual activity (75% of B V asocciated subjects started their sexual activity by the age 15-18 years). CONCLUSIONS: The established early age for aquiring BV among Bulgarian women is very important and alarming sign. This is the first study on the etiological role of G. vaginalis and on the risk factors for BV in Bulgaria.
TI  - Comparative genomics of Lactobacillus crispatus suggests novel mechanisms for the competitive exclusion of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus crispatus is a ubiquitous micro-organism encountered in a wide range of host-associated habitats. It can be recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and it is a common constituent of the vaginal microbiota of humans. Moreover, L. crispatus can contribute to the urogenital health of the host through competitive exclusion and the production of antimicrobial agents. In order to investigate the genetic diversity of this important urogenital species, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of L. crispatus. RESULTS: Utilizing the completed genome sequence of a strain ST1 and the draft genome sequences of nine other L. crispatus isolates, we defined the scale and scope of the pan- and core genomic potential of L. crispatus. Our comparative analysis identified 1,224 and 2,705 ortholog groups present in all or only some of the ten strains, respectively. Based on mathematical modeling, sequencing of additional L. crispatus isolates would result in the identification of new genes and functions, whereas the conserved core of the ten strains was a good representation of the final L. crispatus core genome, estimated to level at about 1,116 ortholog groups. Importantly, the current core was observed to encode bacterial components potentially promoting urogenital health. Using antibody fragments specific for one of the conserved L. crispatus adhesins, we demonstrated that the L. crispatus core proteins have a potential to reduce the ability of Gardnerella vaginalis to adhere to epithelial cells. These findings thereby suggest that L. crispatus core proteins could protect the vagina from G. vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our pan-genome analysis provides insights into the intraspecific genome variability and the collective molecular mechanisms of the species L. crispatus. Using this approach, we described the differences and similarities between the genomes and identified features likely to be important for urogenital health. Notably, the conserved genetic backbone of L. crispatus accounted for close to 60% of the ortholog groups of an average L. crispatus strain and included factors for the competitive exclusion of G. vaginalis, providing an explanation on how this urogenital species could improve vaginal health.
TI  - Term and preterm labour are associated with distinct microbial community structures in placental membranes which are independent of mode of delivery.
AB  - Infection is considered a possible trigger for preterm labour, supported by evidence showing the presence of bacteria in the placenta and placental membranes from preterm births. In this study, 16S rDNA pyrosequencing was used to identify bacteria in placental membranes. Caesarean sections and vaginal deliveries at term were found to harbour common genera. Mycoplasma hominis, Aerococcus christensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum were either only present in preterm membranes or in greater abundance than at term. These data support previous studies that used either targeted qPCR or broad-range 16S rDNA PCR and cloning but not a recent microbiome analysis of placental tissue using high-throughput sequencing.
TI  - High Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis vaginal loads are associated with preterm birth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis is a risk factor for preterm birth. The various conventional methods for its diagnosis are laborious and not easily reproducible. Molecular quantification methods have been reported recently, but the specific risk factors they might identify remain unclear. METHODS: A prospective multicenter national study included pregnant women at risk of preterm birth. A quantitative molecular tool using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension quantified Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacilli, Mycoplasma hominis, and the human albumin gene (for quality control). RESULTS: In 813 pregnancies, high vaginal loads of either or both of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were associated with preterm birth (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.1-14.1; P = .031). A high vaginal load of A. vaginae was significantly associated with shortened time to delivery and therefore pregnancy length. These times were, respectively, 152.2 and 188.2 days (HR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.5-21.3; P < .001) before 22 weeks, 149.0 and 183.2 days (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1-8.2; P = .048) before 28 weeks, and 132.6 and 170.4 days (HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.6; P = .033) before 32 weeks. After multivariate analysis, A. vaginae levels >/=10(8) copies/mL remained significantly associated with delivery before 22 weeks of gestation (adjusted HR, 4.7; 95% CI, .2-17.6; P = .014). CONCLUSIONS: High vaginal loads of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis are associated with late miscarriage and prematurity in high-risk pregnancies. A high vaginal load of A. vaginae (DNA level >/=10(8) copies/mL) identifies a population at high risk of preterm birth. Further studies that both screen for and then treat A. vaginae are needed. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT00484653.
TI  - Breast cancer, aromatase inhibitor therapy, and sexual functioning: a pilot study of the effects of vaginal testosterone therapy.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Women with breast cancer have better cancer-related outcomes with the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs), but the physiological suppression of estradiol can negatively affect sexual functioning because of unpleasant urogenital and vaginal symptoms. Local health care practitioners have observed that the benefits of vaginal testosterone in allaying these unpleasant symptoms in women with breast cancer are similar to the benefits of vaginal estrogen in women without breast cancer. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of using a daily vaginal testosterone cream on the reported sexual health quality of life in women with breast cancer taking AI therapy. METHODS: Thirteen postmenopausal women with breast cancer on AI therapy and experiencing symptoms of sexual dysfunction were recruited from an oncology practice. The women were prescribed a 300 mug testosterone vaginal cream daily for 4 weeks. During the first study visit, a vaginal swab was obtained to rule out the presence of Candida species or Gardnerella vaginalis in participants. Women with positive vaginal swabs were treated prior to starting the vaginal testosterone therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) survey, measuring female sexual health quality of life, was administered during the first study visit and at the final study visit, after completing testosterone therapy. RESULTS: Twelve patients completed 4 weeks of daily vaginal testosterone therapy. When compared with baseline FSFI scores, there was a statistically significant improvement for individual domain scores of desire (P = 0.000), arousal (P = 0.002), lubrication (P = 0.018), orgasm (P = 0.005), satisfaction (P = 0.001), and pain (P = 0.000). Total domain scores reflecting sexual health quality of life also improved when compared with baseline (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a compounded testosterone vaginal cream applied daily for 4 weeks improves reported sexual health quality of life in women with breast cancer taking AIs.

TI  - Recent progress in understanding the epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Bacterial vaginosis epidemiology has been transformed by new theoretical insights and methodologies, such as molecular sequencing. We summarize the progress made in these domains. RECENT FINDINGS: The vaginal microbiome can be classified in five to eight clusters. Bacterial vaginosis-type clusters typically constitute one of these clusters, but in higher risk women, it can constitute up to three clusters. The vaginal microbiomes may be fairly stable or be subject to rapid changes in their constitutive makeup. Bacterial vaginosis does not appear to be a single entity. Certain bacterial communities are associated with particular symptoms of bacterial vaginosis that are paired with unique adverse outcomes. Biofilm-producing Gardnerella vaginalis are likely to play an important role in initiating the structured polymicrobial biofilm that is a hallmark of bacterial vaginosis. SUMMARY: Longitudinal studies currently underway should help elucidate how to best define bacterial vaginosis and its subtypes. Risk factors and outcomes associated with particular bacterial vaginosis subtypes should also be further clarified through these studies.
TI  - Quantification of Atopobium vaginae loads may be a new method for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional methods for the diagnosis of BV is either with poor sensitivity or poor specificity. Thus, establishing a new method based on the vaginal flora is vital for the diagnosis of BV. METHODS: This article is a retrospective research. Based on the Amsel criteria and Nugent score, 230 BV-positive patients and 360 healthy women were enrolled, specific PCR and quantitative PCR were applied to quantify 5 BV-associated bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Megasphaera species and Mobiluncus mulieris. ROC curve was facilitated to screen a bacterial panel with optimal sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Specific PCR showed that the area under ROC curve of A.vag, G.vag + A.vag, G.vag + A.vag + Lepto, G.vag + A.vag + Mega and G.vag + A.vag + M.mul were 0.845, 0.862, 0.865, 0.869 and 0.867, the sensitivity and specificity were higher than 80%, which were practicable methods for the diagnosis of BV. Quantitative PCR showed the area under ROC curve of Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Megasphaera species and Mobiluncus mulieris were 0.959, 0.996, 0.933, 0.748 and 0.639, when the cutoff value of Atopobium vaginae loads was 247,800 copies/mL, the optimal sensitivity and specificity were 0.979 and 0.952, which was distinctly better than specific PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification ofAtopobium vaginae loads may be a new method of excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Effectiveness of the two microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 and Lactobacillus plantarum LP01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is not accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. In contrast, aerobic vaginitis (AV) is predominantly associated with Escherichia coli, but Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus are also involved. Standard treatment of BV consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. The main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and recurrences. This study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize G. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit E. coli, thus identifying a possible use in AV. The second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by BV using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to hinder the growth of G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection 10231. The bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with Lactobacillus plantarum LP01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with BV. The 2 microorganisms Lactobacillus fermentum LF15 (DSM 26955) and L. plantarum LP01 (LMG P-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. The amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. The women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. A clinical examination was performed and the Nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). A statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. RESULTS: L. fermentum LF15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards G. vaginalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. In the human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01, significantly reduced the Nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, P<0.001). Eight women (33.3%) recorded a Nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. At the end of the second month, only 4 women registered a Nugent score >7, definable as BV (16.7%, P=0.065 compared with d28). In the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. CONCLUSIONS: BV, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. Furthermore, BV is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. This study suggests the ability of the 2 strains L. fermentum LF15 and L. plantarum LP01 to counteract acute Gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. This could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against Gardnerella on the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. Furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. In the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against E. coli, their prospective use in AV could also prove interesting.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis triggers NLRP3 inflammasome recruitment in THP-1 monocytes.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is a Gram-positive bacterium associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), pelvic inflammatory disease, and preterm birth. BV is the most prevalent vaginal dysbiosis in women of childbearing age characterized by the absence of normal lactobacilli and an overgrowth of G. vaginalis and other bacteria. Although mucosal fluids from BV patients exhibit increases in proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 mRNA, G. vaginalis has not been demonstrated to directly induce an inflammatory response. This study tested the hypothesis that G. vaginalis induces an inflammatory response in the human monocyte cell line, THP-1. The objectives of the study were to measure proinflammatory cytokine production, molecular mechanisms by which cytokines are produced, and whether G. vaginalis results in death of the monocytic cells. We found that G. vaginalis induced significant increases in the inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-1beta, IL-18, as well as TNF-alpha in treated cells. G. vaginalis caused significant cell death by 24h post-treatment compared with untreated controls, but cells remained 66% viable. Caspase-1 cleavage in treated cells confirmed the inflammatory cell death, and NLRP3 knockdown confirmed its involvement through reduction of IL-1beta secretion. Using a stably expressing YFP-ASC THP-1 cell model with immunofluorescent staining, YFP-ASC colocalized with NLRP3 in G. vaginalis-treated cells and the addition of a caspase-1 inhibitor wholly ameliorated IL-1beta secretion. Our study provides new insight into the role of G. vaginalis in inflammatory conditions in the genital tract.
TI  - Identification of cytolytic vaginosis versus vulvovaginal candidiasis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to observe the morphological characteristic of vaginal discharge in patients with cytolytic vaginosis (CV) under the microscope and to identify it in patients with CV and in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). METHODS: A total of 108 subjects including 21 healthy women, 33 patients with CV, and 54 patients with VVC were enrolled in the present morphological study. Vaginal discharge was collected and made into smear. The morphological characteristics of these vaginal smears with Gram staining were observed under the microscope. The smears were assessed for the quantity of lactobacilli, epithelial cell morphology, and the absence or presence of Candida species, Trichomonas vaginalis, and clue sells. RESULTS: First, the age, the level of education, and especially the status of pregnancy of patients with CV were significantly different from those of the patients with VVC. Second, the morphological characteristics of patients with CV consisted of overgrowth of lactobacilli, the presence of naked nuclei and fragments of the epithelial cells, a paucity of leukocytes, and the absence of Candida species and other pathogens. However, the morphological characteristic of patients with VVC consisted of the presence or absence of lactobacilli and the presence of normal epithelial cells, candidal spores, blastospores, hyphae, or other pathogens such as T. vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: Both CV and VVC can be identified based on the quantity of lactobacilli, the morphology of the epithelial cells, and the absence or presence of Candida species and other pathogens, and the misdiagnosis of CV as VVC can be avoided.
TI  - Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-lactic acid nanocarrier-based degradable hydrogels for restoring the vaginal microenvironment.
AB  - Women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) display reduced vaginal acidity, which make them susceptible to associated infections such as HIV. In the current study, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) nanocarrier-based degradable hydrogels were developed for the controlled release of lactic acid in the vagina of BV-infected women. PEG-lactic acid (PEG-LA) nanocarriers were prepared by covalently attaching lactic acid to 8-arm PEG-SH via cleavable thioester bonds. PEG-LA nanocarriers with 4 copies of lactic acid per molecule provided controlled release of lactic acid with a maximum release of 23% and 47% bound lactic acid in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4) and acetate buffer (AB, pH4.3), respectively. The PEG nanocarrier-based hydrogels were formed by cross-linking the PEG-LA nanocarriers with 4-arm PEG-NHS via degradable thioester bonds. The nanocarrier-based hydrogels formed within 20 min under ambient conditions and exhibited an elastic modulus that was 100-fold higher than the viscous modulus. The nanocarrier-based degradable hydrogels provided controlled release of lactic acid for several hours; however, a maximum release of only 10%-14% bound lactic acid was observed possibly due to steric hindrance of the polymer chains in the cross-linked hydrogel. In contrast, hydrogels with passively entrapped lactic acid showed burst release with complete release within 30 min. Lactic acid showed antimicrobial activity against the primary BV pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3.6 mg/ml. In addition, the hydrogels with passively entrapped lactic acid showed retained antimicrobial activity with complete inhibition G. vaginalis growth within 48 h. The results of the current study collectively demonstrate the potential of PEG nanocarrier-based hydrogels for vaginal administration of lactic acid for preventing and treating BV.
TI  - Epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections in rural southwestern Haiti: the  Grand'Anse Women's Health Study.
AB  - The study attempts to define socioeconomic, clinical, and laboratory correlates in vaginitis and other sexually transmitted infections in rural southwestern Haiti. A convenience sample of subjects recruited from a rural women's health clinic and attending an established clinic at the Haitian Health Foundation (HHF) clinic was studied. A standardized history and physical examination, including speculum examination, and collection of blood, urine, and vaginal swabs were obtained from the women at the rural clinic. Additional vaginal swab samples only for Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) testing were obtained from women at the HHF clinic in Jeremie. Laboratory results from Leon subjects were positive for Gardnerella vaginalis in 41% (41 of 100), Trichomonas vaginalis in 13.5% (14 of 104), Candida sp. in 9% (9 of 100), Mycoplasma genitalium in 6.7% (7 of 104), Chlamydia trachomatis in 1.9% (2 of 104), and Neisseria gonorrhea in 1% (1 of 104) of patients. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody tests were negative in 100% (103 of 103) of patients, and syphilis antibody testing was positive for treponemal antibodies in 7.7% (8 of 104) patients. For subjects from the HHF, 19.9% were positive for T. vaginalis, 11.9% were positive for C. trachomatis, 10.1% were positive for M. genitalium, and 4.1% were positive for N. gonorrhea. Infections with G. vaginalis, T. vaginalis, and Candida were the most common. N. gonorrhea, C. trachomatis, Candida sp., T. vaginalis, and M. genitalium infections were associated with younger age (less than 31 years old).
TI  - Human-specific bacterial pore-forming toxins induce programmed necrosis in erythrocytes.
AB  - A subgroup of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) family of pore-forming toxins (PFTs) has an unusually narrow host range due to a requirement for binding to human CD59 (hCD59), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked complement regulatory molecule. hCD59-specific CDCs are produced by several organisms that inhabit human mucosal surfaces and can act as pathogens, including Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus intermedius. The consequences and potential selective advantages of such PFT host limitation have remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to species restriction, PFT ligation of hCD59 triggers a previously unrecognized pathway for programmed necrosis in primary erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) from humans and transgenic mice expressing hCD59. Because they lack nuclei and mitochondria, RBCs have typically been thought to possess limited capacity to undergo programmed cell death. RBC programmed necrosis shares key molecular factors with nucleated cell necroptosis, including dependence on Fas/FasL signaling and RIP1 phosphorylation, necrosome assembly, and restriction by caspase-8. Death due to programmed necrosis in RBCs is executed by acid sphingomyelinase-dependent ceramide formation, NADPH oxidase- and iron-dependent reactive oxygen species formation, and glycolytic formation of advanced glycation end products. Bacterial PFTs that are hCD59 independent do not induce RBC programmed necrosis. RBC programmed necrosis is biochemically distinct from eryptosis, the only other known programmed cell death pathway in mature RBCs. Importantly, RBC programmed necrosis enhances the growth of PFT-producing pathogens during exposure to primary RBCs, consistent with a role for such signaling in microbial growth and pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE: In this work, we provide the first description of a new form of programmed cell death in erythrocytes (RBCs) that occurs as a consequence of cellular attack by human-specific bacterial toxins. By defining a new RBC death pathway that shares important components with necroptosis, a programmed necrosis module that occurs in nucleated cells, these findings expand our understanding of RBC biology and RBC-pathogen interactions. In addition, our work provides a link between cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) host restriction and promotion of bacterial growth in the presence of RBCs, which may provide a selective advantage to human-associated bacterial strains that elaborate such toxins and a potential explanation for the narrowing of host range observed in this toxin family.

TI  - Differences in vaginal microbiome in African American women versus women of European ancestry.
AB  - Women of European ancestry are more likely to harbour a Lactobacillus-dominated microbiome, whereas African American women are more likely to exhibit a diverse microbial profile. African American women are also twice as likely to be diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and are twice as likely to experience preterm birth. The objective of this study was to further characterize and contrast the vaginal microbial profiles in African American versus European ancestry women. Through the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project at Virginia Commonwealth University, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis was used to compare the microbiomes of vaginal samples from 1268 African American women and 416 women of European ancestry. The results confirmed significant differences in the vaginal microbiomes of the two groups and identified several taxa relevant to these differences. Major community types were dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis and the uncultivated bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1 (BVAB1) that were common among African Americans. Moreover, the prevalence of multiple bacterial taxa that are associated with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and preterm birth, including Mycoplasma, Gardnerella, Prevotella and Sneathia, differed between the two ethnic groups. We investigated the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including pregnancy, body mass index, diet, smoking and alcohol use, number of sexual partners, and household income, to vaginal community composition. Ethnicity, pregnancy and alcohol use correlated significantly with the relative abundance of bacterial vaginosis-associated species. Trends between microbial profiles and smoking and number of sexual partners were observed; however, these associations were not statistically significant. These results support and extend previous findings that there are significant differences in the vaginal microbiome related to ethnicity and demonstrate that these differences are pronounced even in healthy women.
TI  - Characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy Canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. Understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. During a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth, colonization, and community structure. The objective of this study was to assess the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy Canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. Vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. Amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. Samples were also assayed for total 16S rRNA gene content and Gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative PCR and screened for the presence of Mollicutes by using family and genus-specific PCR. RESULTS: Overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. Microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. Clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus jensenii. Interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either Bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. Direct G. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and Mollicutes, including Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and Ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. Of interest in these findings was the presence of Bifidobacteriales beyond just Gardnerella species. Bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16S rRNA gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.
TI  - Ethnic variations in cervical cytokine concentrations and vaginal flora during pregnancy.
AB  - PROBLEM: Pregnancy-mediated changes in immunity may influence risk of HIV-1 acquisition. This risk appears greatest among non-Caucasian women. METHOD OF STUDY: Pregnant women with low risk of immune disruption were enrolled in a prospective observational cohort. Study visits occurred each trimester and postpartum. Semi-quantitative vaginal cultures and concentrations of cervical cytokines were compared between Caucasian and non-Caucasian women. RESULTS: In the second trimester, non-Caucasian women were more likely to be colonized with Gardnerella vaginalis (62% versus 25%, P = 0.02) and non-pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods (43% versus 8%, P = 0.01). Mycoplasma hominis was more frequently isolated in non-Caucasian women throughout the second (29% versus 4%, P = 0.03) and third trimesters (35% versus 6%, P = 0.04). Non-Caucasian women had higher median interleukin (IL)-10 concentrations throughout the second (128 pg/mL versus 7 pg/mL, P = 0.05) and third trimesters (224 pg/mL versus 7 pg/mL, P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Non-Caucasian women experienced a greater diversity of microorganisms and increased IL-10 in the second and third trimesters.
TI  - Utility of microscopic techniques and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for the diagnosis of vaginal microflora alterations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of Nugent score, wet mount microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test developed in Russia for bacterial vaginosis (BV) diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred Caucasian women were enrolled in this study. Three vaginal samples were taken from each participant: 1 for PCR analysis, 1 for Nugent score evaluation, and 1 for wet mount microscopy. The smears for microscopy were air-dried and sent to Femicare, Tienen, Belgium, for blinded analysis by microscopy. Multiplex real-time PCR was performed using primers and probes targeting Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus species, and total quantity of bacterial DNA (16SrRNA gene). RESULTS: Agreement among the 3 methods was 72 (73.5%) of 98 samples. Agreement between Nugent score and PCR results was 77 (78.6%) of 98 samples; between wet mount microscopy and PCR, 81 (82.65%) of 98 samples; between wet mount microscopy and Nugent score, 84 (85.7%) of 98 samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the methods studied were as follows: 75% (21/28) and 97.1% (68/70) for Nugent score, 96.4% (27/28) and 94.3% (66/70) for wet mount microscopy, 92.8% (26/28) and 85.7% (60/70) for PCR, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that wet mount microscopy is a superior method for BV diagnosis. The PCR test under study showed a high sensitivity and can be used for discrimination between normal flora and BV.
TI  - Silver sucrose octasulfate (IASOS) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  - This in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of Sucrose Octasulfate (IASOS) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing IASOS (SilSOS Femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. In BHI and LAPT culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different pHs were tested. IASOS exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. The results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced IASOS efficacy only to a moderate extent. Whereas comparable MBCs (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) were observed for G. vaginalis (10 mg/L Ag+), E. coli and E. aerogenes (25 mg/L Ag+) in both media, higher MBCs were found for S. aureus and S. agalactiae in LAPT cultures (50 mg/L Ag+ versus 25 mg/L Ag+). No minimal concentration totally inhibiting the growth of C. albicans was found. Nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/L Ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in Candida growth was observed. pH differently affected the antimicrobial properties of IASOS against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at pH higher than the physiological pH was generally observed. It can be therefore concluded that IASOS exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against C. albicans. The antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel SilSOS Femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of IASOS. Overall, our findings support IASOS as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.

TI  - Performance of the Affirm VP-III using residual vaginal discharge collected from  the speculum to characterize vaginitis in symptomatic women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of collecting the Affirm VP-III test sample using the residual vaginal discharge found on the speculum. METHODS AND METHODS: One hundred nine symptomatic women (>/=18 y) participated in this study. During pelvic examination, vaginal fluid was collected onto 3 swabs for office-based diagnostic tests and Affirm (referred to as Affirm-R). A fourth swab was used to collect residual vaginal discharge from the speculum, followed by Affirm testing (referred to as Affirm-RVD). Sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen kappa agreement for office-based diagnostic tests and Affirm-RVD were determined against Affirm-R. RESULTS: Complete results were available for 99 samples. Cohen kappa agreement between Affirm-RVD and Affirm-R was 0.66 (p<.0001) for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.81 (p<.0001) for Candida species, and 1.0 (p<.0001) for Trichomonas vaginalis. Affirm-RVD sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 73.8%, 91.2%, 86.1%, and 82.5% for G. vaginalis; 84.2%, 96.3%, 84.2%, and 96.3% for Candida species; and 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100% for T. vaginalis, respectively. Cohen kappa agreement between office-based diagnostic tests and Affirm-R was 0.16 (p=.141) for G. vaginalis, 0.46 (p<.0001) for Candida species, and 0.55 (p<.0001) for T. vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: The Affirm VP-III sample collected from the residual vaginal discharge found on the speculum after performing office-based diagnostic tests can produce comparable results to traditionally collected sample.
TI  - Comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the US.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to HIV infection and shedding. We assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between HIV-infected and uninfected women from Rwanda and the United States. METHODS: Genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from 46 US women (36 HIV-infected, 10 HIV-uninfected) and 40 Rwandan women (18 HIV-infected, 22 HIV-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) Nugent scores. Species of Lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. Prevalence of genera and Lactobacillus species were compared using Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Overall the seven most prevalent genera were Lactobacillus (74%), Prevotella (56%), Gardnerella (55%), Atopobium (42%), Sneathia (37%), Megasphaera (30%), and Parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing Rwandan to US women, except for Megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). Additionally, Rwandan women had higher frequencies of Mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and Eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of Lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and Allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with US women. The prevalence of Mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in HIV-infected Rwandan women (39%), compared to HIV-infected US women (6%), HIV-uninfected Rwandan (9%) and US (10%) women. The most prevalent lactobacillus species in both Rwandan and US women was L. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by L. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), L. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), L. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and L. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: We found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and Lactobacillus species in Rwandan and US women. Further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.
TI  - Characterization of the vaginal microflora in health and disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an imbalance of the vaginal bacterial microbiota and its aetiology is still unknown. Our aims were to investigate the diagnostic potential of species/genus specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) for bacteria present in swabs and first-void urine (FVU) samples using Nugent's and Claeys' criteria and 454 sequencing of the vaginal microbiome as reference. METHODS: Self-collected swabs, vaginal smears and FVU were obtained from 177 women from Greenland (Study I and III) and physician-collected vaginal swabs and smears were obtained from 163 Swedish women (Study II). BV was diagnosed by Nugent's criteria in Study I and III and by Amsel's criteria in Study II. The vaginal swabs and FVU samples were analysed by qPCR for selected vaginal bacteria in all three studies and for four sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Study I. RESULTS: Study I: STIs were common in women from Greenland and BV was found in 45% of these women but was not associated with individual STIs. In multivariate logistic analysis, Atopobium vaginae and Prevotella spp. were both independently associated with BV in swabs. BV could be subdivided into clusters dominated by a single or a few species together. Seven vaginal bacteria (A. vaginae, Prevotella spp. Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacterial vaginosis associated bacterium (BVAB) 2, Eggerthella-like bacterium, Leptotrichia amnionii and Megasphaera type 1) had areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve > 85% in swabs, suggesting that they were good predictors of BV according to Nugent. Study II: For the majority of species/genera, the kappa values indicated fair to good agreement when their presence was determined by 454 pyrosequencing versus real-time PCR. The same seven vaginal bacteria as found in Study I, had areas under the ROC-curve > 85% in swabs from Swedish women, demonstrating a good diagnostic accuracy for BV according to Amsel. Study III: In a multivariate model, Megasphaera type 1 and Prevotella spp. remained significantly associated with BV in FVU samples. A linear regression analysis showed good agreement between bacterial load from swabs and FVU, but Prevotella spp. could be detected in high numbers in a few FVU samples without being present in swabs. After applying ROC curve analysis, the same seven vaginal bacteria as previously mentioned showed good prediction for BV according to Nugent in FVU. BV could be detected with comparable sensitivity in FVU and vaginal swabs. CONCLUSION: BV can be diagnosed by molecular methods performed either on swabs or urine but it is important to apply thresholds in order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Furthers it was possible to identify clusters of BV dominated by single or paired bacteria, and these clusters could classify BV into subgroups, providing a more detailed understanding of the condition. Seven vaginal bacteria were highly accurate for BV diagnosis both in swabs and FVU. Finally a good agreement between Nugent and Claeys was found.
TI  - Bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted infections are a significant cause of genital disease, infertility and hospital admissions. The economic impact is high. An accurate diagnosis is often difficult and time consuming. We report the development and validation of a novel bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling (STIP) assay that detects 18 sexually transmitted infections using a multiplex PCR followed by Luminex bead-based hybridisation. METHODS: STIP was validated using urogenital samples pretested by commercially available quantitative PCR, microscopy or by culturing methods. RESULTS: STIP specifically detects Chlamydia trachomatis, Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma (M.) genitalium, M. hominis, M. pneumonia, M. spermatophilum, Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. parvum, and quantifies bacterial vaginosis-associated Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis as well as three Candida species and normal genital flora-associated Lactobacillus species. STIP reached an overall concordance of 95-100% with commercially available quantitative PCR tests. Compared to Nugent score, STIP reached a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 86% for bacterial vaginosis detection. Candida specimens, pretested by direct culturing, were identified with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: STIP is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing a broad spectrum of urogenital infections.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of seaweed extracts on the growth of the vaginal bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Of 44 species of seaweed screened for potential anti-Gardnerella vaginalis activity, 27 (61.4%) showed antimicrobial activity by the agar disk-diffusion method. Among them, the strongest activities against the pathogen were exhibited by Chlorophyta, with Ulva pertusa producing an 11.3-mm zone of inhibition at 5 mg disk(-)(1). The MIC values of U. pertusa extracts against both G. vaginalis KCTC 5096 and KCTC 5097, the main cause of vaginosis, were 312 mug ml(-)(1), while the MIC values against both Candida albicans KCTC 7270 and KCTC 7965, the main cause of candidiasis, were 2.5 mg ml(-)(1). Against Lactobacillus gasseri KCTC 3173 and Lactobacillus jensenii KCTC 5194, members of the normal vaginal microflora, no inhibitory effect was seen even at 10 mg ml(-)(1). To identify the primary active compounds, a U. pertusa powder was successively fractionated according to polarity, and the main active agents against G. vaginalis KCTC 5096 were determined to be nitrogenous compounds (156 mug ml(-)(1) of the MIC value). According to these results, it was suggested that extracts of the seaweed U. pertusa are valuable for the development of natural therapeutic agents for treating women with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against Escherichia coli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Female genital tract secretions inhibit E. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. We hypothesized that high E. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a Lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-E. coli activity. The V6 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Filtered culture supernatants from Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for E. coli inhibitory activity. RESULTS: Sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. There was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8 each). However, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low E. coli inhibitory activity. High activity was associated with a predominance of L. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from L. crispatus exhibited greater E. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from L. iners or G. vaginalis. Notably, the E. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of L. crispatus. CONCLUSION: Microbiome communities with abundant L. crispatus likely contribute to the E. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent E. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.
TI  - [Place of vulvovaginal candidiasis in the lower genital tract infections and associated risk factors among women in Benin].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the place of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis (VVC) in the lower genital infections and seek risk factors among women in Benin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in the laboratory of mycology of Hopital de la Mere et de l'Enfant Lagune (Homel) from 1st March to 31st July, 2013. It involved all the women who were asked a vaginal swab and gave their consent in written form. After administration of a questionnaire, the vaginal samples were collected with sterile cotton swabs for a test with potassium hydroxide, an estimation of vaginal pH, direct microscopic examination, fresh, and after a Gram stain and culture on Sabouraud-chloramphenicol, ordinary agar and fresh blood agar. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one women were included in the study period. Clinical signs were dominated by vaginal discharge (74.8%), followed by vulvar pruritus (51.9%) and dyspareunia (36.6%). Culture on Sabouraud was positive in 51 cases or 38.9%. Candida albicans was isolated in 96.1% of cases, against 3.9% of Candida glabrata. The risk factors involved were: pregnancy, antibiotics, synthetic underclothing and frequent wearing tight pants. In addition of Candida, Gardnerella vaginalis was found in 36.6% of samples with an association with C. albicans in 28.2% of cases. CONCLUSION: This study showed that vulvovaginal candidiasis is the leading cause of lower genital tract infections in women in Benin with involvement of several risk factors which research is needed to develop appropriate preventive measures.
TI  - Vaginal infections among pregnant women at Omdurman Maternity Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial infections of the vagina in pregnant women are health problems that lead to serious medical complications and consequences. This study aimed to investigate and determine antimicrobial susceptibilities of the causative agents of vaginal infections in pregnant women. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study of pregnant women (n = 200) was conducted between August and December 2008 at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan. Vaginal and cervical swabs were obtained from each subject and processed for isolation and identification of pathogenic microorganisms using standard methods of wet mount preparation, direct Gram smear, Nugent scoring system, direct immunofluorescence, and cultural techniques. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates was performed using standard procedures. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS program version 12.0.1. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Of the 200 pregnant women enrolled, BV was detected in 49.8%, followed by Chlamydia trachomatis (31.3%) and Candida albicans (16.6%), with low frequencies of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1.8%) and Trichomonas vaginalis (0.5%). Higher infection rates were recorded among subjects in the third trimester (71.6%) than in the second trimester of gestation (28.4%). No significant association (p = 0.7) between history of abortions and C. trachomatis infections was found. Gentamicin was the most active agent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Clarythromycin was the most active against Mycoplasma species. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with vaginal complaints revealed various positive microbiology results. Such cases may require specific medication. Routine culture of vaginal and cervical samples should be performed on all pregnant women during prenatal visits.
TI  - Rifaximin modulates the vaginal microbiome and metabolome in women affected by bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal disorder characterized by the decrease of lactobacilli and overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and resident anaerobic vaginal bacteria. In the present work, the effects of rifaximin vaginal tablets on vaginal microbiota and metabolome of women affected by BV were investigated by combining quantitative PCR and a metabolomic approach based on (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance. To highlight the general trends of the bacterial communities and metabolomic profiles in response to the antibiotic/placebo therapy, a multivariate statistical strategy was set up based on the trajectories traced by vaginal samples in a principal component analysis space. Our data demonstrated the efficacy of rifaximin in restoring a health-like condition in terms of both bacterial communities and metabolomic features. In particular, rifaximin treatment was significantly associated with an increase in the lactobacillus/BV-related bacteria ratio, as well as with an increase in lactic acid concentration and a decrease of a pool of metabolites typically produced by BV-related bacteria (acetic acid, succinate, short-chain fatty acids, and biogenic amines). Among the tested dosages of rifaximin (100 and 25 mg for 5 days and 100 mg for 2 days), 25 mg for 5 days was found to be the most effective.
TI  - Evaluation of polycaprolactone matrices for the intravaginal delivery of metronidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Microporous, poly (varepsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) matrices loaded with the antibacterial, metronidazole were produced by rapidly cooling suspensions of drug powder in PCL solutions in acetone. Drug incorporation in the matrices increased from 2.0% to 10.6% w/w on raising the drug loading of the PCL solution from 5% to 20% w/w measured with respect to the PCL content. Drug loading efficiencies of 40-53% were obtained. Rapid 'burst release' of 35-55% of the metronidazole content was recorded over 24 h when matrices were immersed in simulated vaginal fluid (SVF), due to the presence of large amounts of drug on matrix surface as revealed by Raman microscopy. Gradual release of around 80% of the drug content occurred over the following 12 days. Metronidazole released from PCL matrices in SVF retained antimicrobial activity against Gardnerella vaginalis in vitro at levels up to 97% compared to the free drug. Basic modelling predicted that the concentrations of metronidazole released into vaginal fluid in vivo from a PCL matrix in the form of an intravaginal ring would exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of metronidazole against G. vaginalis. These findings recommend further investigation of PCL matrices as intravaginal devices for controlled delivery of metronidazole in the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Trichomonas, Candida, and gardnerella in cervical smears of Iranian women for cancer screening.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardrenella vaginalis, and Candida sp are responsible for 90% of vaginitis which has been reported as important risk factors for cervical cancer. AIM: This study aimed to find the prevalence of T. vaginalis, Candida sp, and G. vaginalis in women attended the cancer clinic charity, Babol, Iran and to identify the associated risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study carried out from 1996 to July 2012 on women who attended to a cancer screening program at the cancer clinics charity, Babol, Iran. Papanicolaou test and clinical examinations were performed for each woman. In addition to Papanicolaou test results, demographic data were collected. The data were analyzed with X(2) test using SPSS software, version 18. RESULTS: In total, 2511 out of 33600 (7.5%) cases had vaginal infections. A total of 71 (0.2%), 2248 (6.7%), and 192 (0.6%) of subjects were infected by T. vaginalis, Candida sp, and Gardnerella, respectively. The highest rate of infection was seen in 20-30 and 30-40 years age group. The frequency of vaginal ulcers was higher in trichomoniasis (14.1%). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the prevalence of T. vaginalis, Candida sp, and Gardnerella was low among the studied population. Moreover, malignant cytological alternations were not seen in any infected women.

TI  - Seasonal variation of antibacterial activities in the green alga Ulva pertusa Kjellman.
AB  - The present study was performed to screen out the extracts of algae and assess the seasonal variation in antimicrobial activity of Ulva pertusa against Gardnerella vaginalis. Seasonal variation in antibacterial activity was observed, with the extracts showing no activity during summer and autumn, and showing antibacterial activity from early winter (December) to middle spring (April). The maximum value of antimicrobial activity (6.5 mm inhibition zone at 5 mg disk(-1)) of U. pertusa against G. vaginalis was observed in April. Otherwise, for both chlorophyll a and b, the highest content (2.87 mg g(-1) and 1.37 mg g(-1)) was observed in March 2009. These results may reflect variation in cellular chemical compositions such as secondary metabolite(s) rather than chlorophyll and biological activities according to season.
TI  - Curative effect of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus fermentum L23 in a murine model of vaginal infection by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection characterized by changes in the vaginal microbiota. The objective of this work was to evaluate the colonization ability and curative effect of Lactobacillus fermentum L23 after vaginal administration in female BALB/c mice infected with Gardnerella vaginalis. One dose of Lact. fermentum L23 containing 10(9 ) CFU ml(-1) was administered locally in a murine vaginal model. L23 colonized the vaginal tract of BALB-c mice after one inoculation. The infection by G. vaginalis in a murine model was induced by vaginal administration of a 1 x 10(6 ) CFU ml(-1) suspension. Infection with the pathogen was observed in the vaginal tract for 4 days. At 144 h after inoculation, levels of 4 log10 CFU ml(-1) were observed. The curative effect of L23 was evaluated with one administration at 1 x 10(9 ) CFU ml(-1) 72 h after the inoculation with G. vaginalis. Lactobacillus fermentum L23 inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis. The results of suppression of G. vaginalis using different concentrations of L23 were favourable due that these concentrations are normally used in commercial formulas. The obtained results indicate that Lact. fermentum L23 inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis. Therefore, L23 might be used as a potential biotherapeutic agent for the elimination of this bacterium. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The use of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus fermentum L23 as a biotherapeutic agent can be expected to prevent and treat genital infections, particularly recurrent bacterial vaginosis, with similar concentrations to those normally used in commercial formulas. It is likely that the use of this probiotic strain for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis will provide a natural and nontoxic treatment modality.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis outcompetes 29 other bacterial species isolated from patients with bacterial vaginosis, using in an in vitro biofilm formation model.
AB  - Despite the worldwide prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), its etiology is still unknown. Although BV has been associated with the presence of biofilm, the ability of BV-associated bacteria to form biofilms is still largely unknown. Here, we isolated 30 BV-associated species and characterized their virulence, using an in vitro biofilm formation model. Our data suggests that Gardnerella vaginalis had the highest virulence potential, as defined by higher initial adhesion and cytotoxicity of epithelial cells, as well as the greater propensity to form a biofilm. Interestingly, we also demonstrated that most of the BV-associated bacteria had a tendency to grow as biofilms.
TI  - Polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels for controlled release of the antimicrobial subtilosin for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Current treatment options for bacterial vaginosis (BV) have been shown to be inadequate at preventing recurrence and do not provide protection against associated infections, such as that with HIV. This study examines the feasibility of incorporating the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin within covalently cross-linked polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels for vaginal administration. The PEG-based hydrogels (4% and 6% [wt/vol]) provided a two-phase release of subtilosin, with an initial rapid release rate of 4.0 mug/h (0 to 12 h) followed by a slow, sustained release rate of 0.26 mug/h (12 to 120 h). The subtilosin-containing hydrogels inhibited the growth of the major BV-associated pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis with a reduction of 8 log10 CFU/ml with hydrogels containing >/=15 mug entrapped subtilosin. In addition, the growth of four common species of vaginal lactobacilli was not significantly inhibited in the presence of the subtilosin-containing hydrogels. The above findings demonstrate the potential application of vaginal subtilosin-containing hydrogels for prophylaxis of BV.
TI  - Identification of vaginal lactobacilli with potential probiotic properties isolated from women in North Lebanon.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the diversity of vaginal lactobacilli in Lebanese women and to evaluate the antagonism, hydrophobicity, and safety characteristics of these strains. This study was performed on samples from 135 women who visited a gynecology clinic in the north of Lebanon, between September 2012 and January 2013. From these samples, 53 different isolates of vaginal lactobacilli were collected from vaginal swabs and identified using biochemical and molecular methods. The use of genotypic Rep-PCR fingerprinting allowed for the organization of these isolates into 23 different groups. Seven of the isolated lactobacilli were antagonistic against the following vaginal pathogens: Gardnerella vaginalis CIP7074T, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33862, Escherichia coli CIP103982, and Candida albicans ATCC10231. The antagonistic lactobacilli strains were then identified using 16S rDNA sequence. The data of this study show that the antagonistic lactobacilli were non-hemolytic, sensitive to most antibiotic tests, free of plasmid DNA, and exhibited interesting hydrophobicity and autoaggregation properties positioning them as potential candidates for probiotic design.

There was excellent agreement between the two sampling devices for Candida spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis.
TI  - Role of Gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis: a conceptual model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge and is associated with important public health complications such as preterm birth and acquisition or transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted infections. Continued controversy concerning the pathogenesis of BV has led to a lack of progress in prevention and management of this infection. METHODS: Development of a conceptual model for the pathogenesis of BV based on review of past and current research. RESULTS: Our model suggests that BV is initiated by the sexual transmission of Gardnerella vaginalis, which has the appropriate virulence factors to adhere to host epithelium, create a biofilm community, and successfully compete with lactobacilli for dominance in the vaginal environment. The genetic diversity of G. vaginalis may result in virulent and avirulent strains. Symbiotic relationships with normally dormant vaginal anaerobes lead to increases in the latter which contribute to the symptoms of BV. CONCLUSIONS: G. vaginalis is the pathogen responsible for the initiation of BV. Future research should focus on preventing its transmission and improved therapeutics for the biofilm infection that is caused by this pathogen and host anaerobes.
TI  - The composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. We compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. RESULTS: A retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n = 22). Serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. A 16S rRNA gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. Linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. The vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of Lactobacillus vaginalis, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). Bacterial community state type (CST) IV-B or CST IV-A characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus Atopobium as well as the presence of Prevotella, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Ruminococcaceae, Parvimonas, Mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. The stability of the vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women; however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively from one CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. to another CST dominated by Lactobacillus spp. CONCLUSION: We report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. Differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. Lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. These results can serve as the basis to study the relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - The diversity of receptor recognition in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are bacterial pore-forming toxins secreted mainly by pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. CDCs generally recognize and bind to membrane cholesterol to create pores and lyse target cells. However, in contrast to typical CDCs such as streptolysin O, several atypical CDCs have been reported. The first of these was intermedilysin, which is secreted by Streptococcus intermedius and has human cell-specificity, human CD59 (huCD59) being its receptor. In the study reported here, the diversity of receptor recognition among CDCs was investigated and multi-receptor recognition characteristics were identified within this toxin family. Streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (Sm-hPAF) secreted by S. mitis strain Nm-65 isolated from a patient with Kawasaki disease was previously shown to hemolyze erythrocytes in a species-dependent manner, its maximum activity being in human cells. In the present study, it was found that Sm-hPAF recognizes both membrane cholesterol and huCD59 as receptors for triggering pore-formation. Moreover, vaginolysin (VLY) of Gardnerella vaginalis showed similar characteristics to Sm-hPAF regarding receptor recognition. On the basis of the results presented here, the mode of receptor recognition of CDCs can be categorized into the following three groups: (i) Group I, comprising typical CDCs with high affinity to cholesterol and no or very little affinity to huCD59; (ii) Group II, including atypical CDCs such as ILY, with no or very little affinity to cholesterol and high affinity to huCD59; and (iii) Group III, which contains atypical CDCs such as Sm-hPAF and VLY with affinity to both cholesterol and huCD59.
TI  - Benzoyl peroxide formulated polycarbophil/carbopol 934P hydrogel with selective antimicrobial activity, potentially beneficial for treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The human vagina is colonized by a variety of indigenous microflora; in healthy individuals the predominant bacterial genus is Lactobacillus while those with bacterial vaginosis (BV) carry a variety of anaerobic representatives of the phylum Actinobacteria. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) encapsulated in a hydrogel against Gardnerella vaginalis, one of the causative agents of BV, as well as indicating its safety for healthy human lactobacilli. Herein, it is shown that in well diffusion assays G. vaginalis is inhibited at 0.01% hydrogel-encapsulated BPO and that the tested Lactobacillus spp. can tolerate concentrations of BPO up to 2.5%. In direct contact assays (cells grown in a liquid culture containing hydrogel with 1% BPO or BPO particles), we demonstrated that hydrogels loaded with 1% BPO caused 6-log reduction of G. vaginalis. Conversely, three of the tested Lactobacillus spp. were not inhibited while L. acidophilus growth was slightly delayed. The rheological properties of the hydrogel formulation were probed using oscillation frequency sweep, oscillation shear stress sweep, and shear rate sweep. This shows the gel to be suitable for vaginal application and that the encapsulation of BPO did not alter rheological properties.
TI  - Reconstitution of cholesterol-dependent vaginolysin into tethered phospholipid bilayers: implications for bioanalysis.
AB  - Functional reconstitution of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin vaginolysin (VLY) from Gardnerella vaginalis into artificial tethered bilayer membranes (tBLMs) has been accomplished. The reconstitution of VLY was followed in real-time by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Changes of the EIS parameters of the tBLMs upon exposure to VLY solutions were consistent with the formation of water-filled pores in the membranes. It was found that reconstitution of VLY is a strictly cholesterol-dependent, irreversible process. At a constant cholesterol concentration reconstitution of VLY occurred in a concentration-dependent manner, thus allowing the monitoring of VLY concentration and activity in vitro and opening possibilities for tBLM utilization in bioanalysis. EIS methodology allowed us to detect VLY down to 0.5 nM (28 ng/mL) concentration. Inactivation of VLY by certain amino acid substitutions led to noticeably lesser tBLM damage. Pre-incubation of VLY with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody 9B4 inactivated the VLY membrane damage in a concentration-dependent manner, while the non-neutralizing antibody 21A5 exhibited no effect. These findings demonstrate the biological relevance of the interaction between VLY and the tBLM. The membrane-damaging interaction between VLY and tBLM was observed in the absence of the human CD59 receptor, known to strongly facilitate the hemolytic activity of VLY. Taken together, our study demonstrates the applicability of tBLMs as a bioanalytical platform for the detection of the activity of VLY and possibly other cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
TI  - Increased Gardnerella vaginalis urogenital biofilm in inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a systemic inflammatory condition that affects the entire organism, not only the bowel. An impaired interaction with microbiota has been shown to be important. We looked for bacterial factors, which may contribute to the well-known higher incidence of poor reproductive outcome in IBD. METHODS: Urine specimen of patients with Crohn's disease (N=42), ulcerative colitis (N=46), and randomly selected patients attending the General Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic of the Charite for non-IBD related medical conditions (N=49) was analyzed for bacteria adherent to desquamated epithelial cells and diffusely distributed bacteria in the urine using fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The urine of IBD patients contained significantly more often Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms (CD 38%, UC 43%) than those of the control group (16%). There was no link between current disease activity, history of and present fistula and G. vaginalis biofilms, but the samples of patients with steroid refractory/dependent disease were significantly more often G. vaginalis biofilm positive. No significant differences in number of epithelial cells and leukocytes, and total bacterial counts were present. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant link between IBD and G. vaginalis biofilm. This observation suggests an epithelial barrier dysfunction of the genital tract. Since G. vaginalis is believed to be one of the reasons responsible for bacterial vaginosis, it may be an important factor in the well-known higher incidence of poor reproductive outcome in IBD. Excessive G. vaginalis biofilms in steroid refractory/dependent disease suggests a need to avoid long-term steroid therapy.
TI  - More than meets the eye: associations of vaginal bacteria with gram stain morphotypes using molecular phylogenetic analysis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a highly prevalent condition associated with adverse  health outcomes. Gram stain analysis of vaginal fluid is the standard for confirming the diagnosis of BV, wherein abundances of key bacterial morphotypes are assessed. These Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, and Mobiluncus morphotypes were originally linked to particular bacterial species through cultivation studies, but no studies have systematically investigated associations between uncultivated bacteria detected by molecular methods and Gram stain findings. In this study, 16S-rRNA PCR/pyrosequencing was used to examine associations between vaginal bacteria and bacterial morphotypes in 220 women with and without BV. Species-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR) and fluorescence in Situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used to document concentrations of two bacteria with curved rod morphologies: Mobiluncus and the fastidious BV-associated bacterium-1 (BVAB1). Rank abundance of vaginal bacteria in samples with evidence of curved gram-negative rods showed that BVAB1 was dominant (26.1%), while Mobiluncus was rare (0.2% of sequence reads). BVAB1 sequence reads were associated with Mobiluncus morphotypes (p<0.001). Among women with curved rods, mean concentration of BVAB1 DNA was 2 log units greater than Mobiluncus (p<0.001) using species-specific quantitative PCR. FISH analyses revealed that mean number of BVAB1 cells was 2 log units greater than Mobiluncus cells in women with highest Nugent score (p<0.001). Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were significantly associated with the "Bacteroides morphotype," whereas Bacteroides species were rare. Gram-negative rods designated Mobiluncus morphotypes on Gram stain are more likely BVAB1. These findings provide a clearer picture of the bacteria associated with morphotypes on vaginal Gram stain.

TI  - Prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis among women with lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in women with normal vaginal flora. METHODS: Women without symptoms or signs of vaginal infection and five or fewer lifetime sexual partners were recruited for a longitudinal study of vaginal flora. Negative Amsel criteria and a Nugent score of 0-3 were required for enrolment. Vaginal specimens were self-collected daily for Gram stain and every 3 days for PCR for G vaginalis for 30 days. Women completed daily diaries recording sexual activity, symptoms and menses. RESULTS: Twenty women were recruited for the study with 19 completing all specimens and 1 lost to follow-up. During the 30-day study period, 13/19 (68.4%) of women had normal Nugent scores (0-3) whereas 6/19 (31.6%) of women had at least 2 days of Nugent scores in the intermediate range (p=0.09). Among the 19 women, 9 (47%) were negative for G vaginalis by PCR throughout the study period whereas 10 (53%) had at least one specimen that demonstrated the presence of G vaginalis by PCR. Of those women with intermediate flora on Gram stain during the course of the study 5/6 (83.3%) were positive for G vaginalis while 5/13 (38.5%) of those women with only normal Nugent scores were positive for G vaginalis. Thus, 61.5% of women with normal Nugent scores had no evidence of G vaginalis by serial PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Gardnerella may not be part of the normal flora in women with optimal vaginal health.

TI  - Human papillomavirus and other genital infections in indigenous women from Paraguay: a cross-sectional analytical study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of cervical cancer in Paraguay is among the highest in  the world, with the human papillomavirus (HPV) being a necessary factor for cervical cancer. Knowledge about HPV infection among indigenous women is limited. This cross-sectional study analyzed the frequency of HPV and other genital infections in indigenous Paraguayan women of the Department of Presidente Hayes. METHODS: This study included 181 sexually active women without cervical lesions. They belonged to the following ethnicities: Maka (n = 40); Nivacle (n = 23); Sanapana (n = 33); Enxet Sur (n = 51) and Toba-Qom (n = 34). The detection of HPV and other gynecological infectious microorganisms was performed by either molecular methods (for Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis), gram staining and/or culture (for Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida sp, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae), serological methods (for Treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) or cytology (cervical inflammation). RESULTS: A high prevalence (41.4%) of women positive for at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI) was found (23.2% any-type HPV, 11.6% T pallidum, 10.5% T vaginalis, 9.9% C trachomatis and 0.6% HIV) with 12.2% having more than one STI. HPV infection was the most frequent, with 16.1% of women positive for high-risk HPV types. There was a statistically significant association observed between any-type HPV and C trachomatis (p = 0.004), which indicates that the detection of one of these agents should suggest the presence of the other. There was no association between any-type HPV and other genital infections or cervical inflammation, suggesting that other mechanism could exist to favor infection with the virus. CONCLUSION: This multidisciplinary work suggests that STIs are frequent, making it necessary to implement control measures and improve diagnosis in order to increase the number of cases detected, especially in populations with poor access to health centers.
TI  - Adherence of bacteria to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract of heifers and cows.
AB  - In the present study, we examined the adherence of indigenous vaginal bacteria, probiotic strains, and metritis pathogens to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tracts of heifers and cows and compared their adherence with the bacterial adherence to mucus collected from the stomach and large intestine of pigs. Most of the vaginal strains adhered to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract and strongly adhered to gastric mucus, with the exception of Lactobacillus buchneri 24S8. Only Lactobacillus mucosae 29S8, Enterococcus faecium E21, and E. faecium EAC adhered to colonic mucus. Probiotic strains adhered strongly to mucus collected from the reproductive tract and gastric mucus but did not adhere to colonic mucus. Pathogenic strains were adherent to vaginal, uterine horn, and gastric mucus, except Escherichia coli O8:K88ab:H9 (65), Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Gardnerella vaginalis, which adhered to uterine cervix mucus. Only Kocuria kristinae and G. vaginalis adhered to uterine body mucus; E. coli O149:K88ac (EC) adhered to colonic mucus. The strains did not exhibit host specificity but rather strain specificity. The ability to adhere to mucus was a characteristic unique to each strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding in vitro adherence of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) lactobacilli isolated from different sources to mucus collected from different parts of the reproductive tract.
TI  - Identification, quantification and subtyping of Gardnerella vaginalis in noncultured clinical vaginal samples by quantitative PCR.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is an important component of the human vaginal microflora.  It is proposed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common vaginal condition. Here we describe the development, validation and comparative analysis of a novel molecular approach capable of G. vaginalis identification, quantification and subtyping in noncultured vaginal specimens. Using two quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays, we analysed G. vaginalis bacterial loads and clade distribution in 60 clinical vaginal-swab samples. A very high pathogen prevalence was revealed by species-specific qPCR not only among BV patients (100 %), but also in healthy women (97 %), although the G. vaginalis concentration was significantly lower in non-BV samples. G. vaginalis clades identified in vaginal specimens by subtyping multiplex qPCR, which targets four clade-specific genetic markers, had frequencies of 53 % for clade 1, 25 % for clade 2, 32 % for clade 3 and 83 % for clade 4. Multiple clades were found in 70 % of samples. Single G. vaginalis clades were represented by clade 1 and clade 4 in 28 % of specimens. A positive association with BV was shown for clade 1 and clade 3, while clade 2 was positively associated with intermediate vaginal microflora, but not with BV. Clade 4 demonstrated no correlation with the disorder. The presence of multiple clades had a high positive association with BV, whereas G. vaginalis identified as a single clade was negatively linked with the condition. Polyclonal G. vaginalis infection may be a risk factor for BV.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by analysis of first-void-urine specimens.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is traditionally diagnosed using vaginal samples. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BV can be diagnosed from first-void urine (FVU). Self-collected vaginal smears, vaginal swabs, and FVU were obtained from 176 women. BV was diagnosed by Nugent's criteria. The FVU and vaginal swabs were analyzed by quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) for selected vaginal bacteria (Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 2, Eggerthella-like bacterium, "Leptotrichia amnionii," Megasphaera type 1), and all had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of >85%, suggesting good prediction of BV according to the Nugent score. All seven bacteria in FVU were significantly associated with BV in univariate analysis. An accurate diagnosis of BV from urine was obtained in this population by a combination of qPCRs for Megasphaera type 1 and Prevotella spp. The same two bacteria remained significantly associated with BV in a multivariate model after adjusting for the other five species. There was no statistically significant difference between the sensitivities and specificities of BV diagnosis by molecular methods performed on swabs and FVU samples. A linear regression analysis showed good agreement between bacterial loads from swabs and FVU, but Prevotella spp. could be detected in high numbers in a few FVU samples without being present in swabs. This method will allow diagnosis of BV in studies where only urine has been collected and where detection of BV is considered relevant.
TI  - Tissue-specific IL-10 secretion profile from term human fetal membranes stimulated with pathogenic microorganisms associated with preterm labor in a two-compartment tissue culture system.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interleukin (IL)-10 is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties that plays pivotal roles in immune recognition and maintenance of pregnancy, limiting the harmful effects of pro-inflammatory modulators. The aim of this work was to characterize the contribution of amnion and choriodecidua regions of the human fetal membranes in the production of IL-10 after selective stimulation with Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus agalactiae. METHODS: Pre-labor human fetal membranes were cultured in a two-compartment tissue culture system and stimulated with 1 x 10(6) CFU/ml of each pathogen added to either the amniotic or choriodecidual region or both. RESULTS: Candida albicans and G. vaginalis were the pathogens most effective in inducing IL-10 secretion, increasing 20 and 10 times, respectively, the levels of this cytokine in the choriodecidual compartment. Stimulation with S. agalactiae was effective only in the choriodecidual region, increasing two times IL-10 concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Synthesis and secretion of IL-10 in response to three different pathogens associated with intrauterine infection and preterm birth are differential and depend on the nature of the microorganism and initial contact region.
TI  - Vaginal microbiome in women from Greenland assessed by microscopy and quantitative PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition, although its aetiology remains unexplained. The aim of this study was to analyse the composition of vaginal microbiota in women from Greenland to provide a quantitative description and improve the understanding of BV. METHODS: Self-collected vaginal smears and swabs were obtained from 177 women. The vaginal smears were graded for BV according to Nugent's criteria. The vaginal swab samples were analysed by 19 quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) for selected vaginal bacteria and by PCR for four sexually transmitted infections (STIs). RESULTS: STIs were common: Mycoplasma genitalium 12%, Chlamydia trachomatis 7%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 1%, and Trichomonas vaginalis 0.5%. BV was found in 45% of women, but was not associated with individual STIs. Seven of the 19 vaginal bacteria (Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, BVAB2, Eggerthella-like bacterium, Leptotrichia amnionii, and Megasphaera type 1) had areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve > 85%, suggesting they are good predictors of BV according to Nugent. Prevotella spp. had the highest odds ratio for BV (OR 437; 95% CI 82-2779) in univariate analysis considering only specimens with a bacterial load above the threshold determined by ROC curve analysis as positive, as well as the highest adjusted odds ratio in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 4.4; 95% CI 1.4-13.5). BV could be subdivided into clusters dominated by a single or a few species together. CONCLUSIONS: BV by Nugent score was highly prevalent. Two of seven key species (Prevotella spp. and A. vaginae) remained significantly associated with BV in a multivariate model after adjusting for other bacterial species. G. vaginalis and Prevotella spp. defined the majority of BV clusters.
TI  - Fast and effective paper based sensor for self-diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In this contribution we present a sensitive colorimetric bioactive paper fabricated to determine sialidase-related diseases like bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a one-step and dry format spot assay with fast response and good storage stability. The paper was prepared by three simple steps. The first step involves preparation of poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) microcapsules, the second step is to incubate positively charged microcapsules in negatively charged 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (BCIN) solution, a color enhancer nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), and in the third step, paper was fabricated by incorporating incubated microcapsules into paper pulp. This paper changes color from white to dark purple in the presence of sialidase in as little as 6min, and color could be enhanced with increased length of reaction time. In this reaction system, BCIN was the substrate for sialidase, NBT was the color enhancer, and PEI microcapsules acted as catalyst. The loading efficiency of BCIN was about 22.2%, and filtered BCIN solution could be reused for the next fabrication.
TI  - [Sexually transmitted infections in women living in a prison in Lima, Peru].
AB  - In order to determine the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in  recluse women of Chorrillos Penitentiary I in the city of Lima, Peru, a cross-sectional study was performed, including a simple random sample of women between ages 18 and 54, from whom 180 serum samples and 168 samples of cervical and vaginal discharge were analyzed. The most prevalent etiologic agents identified from cervical and vaginal discharge samples were Chlamydia trachomatis in 42.3%, Gardnerella vaginalis in 24.4% and Trichomonas vaginalis in 10.1% and for serum samples the most prevalent were syphilis and HIV, both in 2.2%. We conclude that there is a high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in recluse women of Chorrillos Penitentiary I in the city of Lima, Peru. There should be routine screenings established for diagnosis and treatment of STIs within the prison system and this population should be included in the sexual and reproductive health programs.
TI  - Vaginolysin drives epithelial ultrastructural responses to Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis, the bacterial species most frequently isolated from women  with bacterial vaginosis (BV), produces a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC), vaginolysin (VLY). At sublytic concentrations, CDCs may initiate complex signaling cascades crucial to target cell survival. Using live-cell imaging, we observed the rapid formation of large membrane blebs in human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells (VK2 and HeLa cells) exposed to recombinant VLY toxin and to cell-free supernatants from growing liquid cultures of G. vaginalis. Binding of VLY to its human-specific receptor (hCD59) is required for bleb formation, as antibody inhibition of either toxin or hCD59 abrogates this response, and transfection of nonhuman cells (CHO-K1) with hCD59 renders them susceptible to toxin-induced membrane blebbing. Disruption of the pore formation process (by exposure to pore-deficient toxoids or pretreatment of cells with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin) or osmotic protection of target cells inhibits VLY-induced membrane blebbing. These results indicate that the formation of functional pores drives the observed ultrastructural rearrangements. Rapid bleb formation may represent a conserved response of epithelial cells to sublytic quantities of pore-forming toxins, and VLY-induced epithelial cell membrane blebbing in the vaginal mucosa may play a role in the pathogenesis of BV.
TI  - [Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common, complex clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in the normal vaginal flora. When symptomatic, it is associated with a malodorous vaginal discharge and on occasion vaginal burning or itching. Under normal conditions, lactobacilli constitute 95% of the bacteria in the vagina. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with severe reduction or absence of the normal H2O2-producing lactobacilli and overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Mycoplasma hominis and Mobiluncus species. Most types of infectious disease are diagnosed by culture, by isolating an antigen or RNA/DNA from the microbe, or by serodiagnosis to determine the presence of antibodies to the microbe. Therefore, demonstration of the presence of an infectious agent is often a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of the disease. This is not the case for bacterial vaginosis, since the ultimate cause of the disease is not yet known. There are a variety of methods for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis but no method can at present be regarded as the best. Diagnosing bacterial vaginosis has long been based on the clinical criteria of Amsel, whereby three of four defined criteria must be satisfied. Nugent's scoring system has been further developed and includes validation of the categories of observable bacteria structures. Up-to-date molecular tests are introduced, and better understanding of vaginal microbiome, a clear definition for bacterial vaginosis, and short-term and long-term fluctuations in vaginal microflora will help to better define molecular tests within the broader clinical context.
TI  - Human epididymis protein 4 and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in vaginal  fluid: relation to vaginal components and bacterial composition.
AB  - Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) is a protease inhibitor and a recently identified serum biomarker for ovarian cancer. Properties of HE4 in the genital tract of healthy women have not been evaluated. We evaluated associations between HE4 and a second vaginal protease inhibitor, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), with vaginal concentrations of innate immune mediators or proteases and with the types of vaginal bacterial communities. Vaginal secretions were collected from 18 healthy reproductive age women and assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for concentrations of HE4, SLPI, kallikrein 5, cathepsin B, interleukin 1beta (IL-1), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra), mannose-binding lectin (MBL), the inducible 70-kDa heat shock protein, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8. The species composition of vaginal bacterial communities in 16 women was characterized by sequencing amplicons derived from 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA genes. Correlations between any 2 assays were analyzed by the Spearman rank correlation tests. Differences in the concentrations of HE4 and SLPI, and between soluble components and vaginal community types, were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U tests. Vaginal HE4 concentrations, but not SLPI levels, were positively correlated with levels of IL-1beta (P = .0152), IL-1ra (P = .0061), MBL (P = .0100), and MMP-8 (P = .0315). The median vaginal HE4 level, as well as concentrations of MBL, IL-1beta, IL-1ra, and MMP-8, was highest when Gardnerella vaginalis dominated a vaginal community. The association between HE4, elevated levels of proteases, immune mediators and high proportions of G vaginalis strongly suggests that HE4 is a component of the proinflammatory immune response in the female genital tract.

TI  - Microbial and vaginal determinants influencing Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma  urealyticum genital colonization in a population of female patients.
AB  - Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum are associated with chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery and pelvic inflammatory disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible risk factors of co-colonization by M. hominis in patients already colonized by U. urealyticum and compare demographic parameters, vaginal pH and microbiota of women colonized by U. urealyticum or M. hominis. A total of 452 patients positive for U. urealyticum or M. hominis were analysed, 421 (93.1%) of whom were positive for U. urealyticum and 31 (6.9%) for M. hominis. Patients positive for M. hominis compared to patients positive for U. urealyticum were more frequently colonized by Gardnerella vaginalis (71% vs 18.5%; p 0.0001), less frequently by lactobacilli (16.1% vs 61.5%; p 0.0001), and more frequently had a pH value higher than 4.5 (96.8% vs 57%; p 0.0001), all conditions associated to bacterial vaginosis (BV). Logistic regression analysis showed that only G. vaginalis colonization and pH higher than 4.5 were independently related to M. hominis colonization (respectively p 0.0001 and p 0.016). Thus, in women colonized by U. urealyticum, BV is an independent risk factor for M. hominis co-colonization.
TI  - Biomedical applications of fermenticin HV6b isolated from Lactobacillus fermentum HV6b MTCC10770.
AB  - Fermenticin HV6b is a class IIa antimicrobial peptide produced by Lactobacillus fermentum HV6b MTCC 10770 isolated from human vaginal ecosystem. It shows growth inhibition of a wide range of opportunistic pathogens of humans, for example, Bacteroides, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Staphylococci, and Streptococci, associated with bacterial vaginosis in humans. It does possess an impressive sperm immobilization and spermicidal activity tested against human sperms which makes it an attractive proposition for formulating antibacterial vaginosis and contraceptive products. Apart from this, in vitro studies conducted against four different tissue models have indicated its potential to be used as a component of anticancerous drug therapy as it is reported to induce apoptosis in cancerous cells. This information could be integrated in future studies focusing on in vivo assessment of anticancerous activity of lactic acid bacterial toxins or bacteriocins.
TI  - Relationship of selected bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria to Nugent score  bacterial vaginosis among urban women early in pregnancy.
AB  - Among urban, primarily African American pregnant women, 74% were identified with  Nugent score bacterial vaginosis (BV). All BV-associated bacteria were more prevalent among women with Nugent score BV. Bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria 3 (BVAB3) had the highest positive predictive value, whereas Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium spp. had the highest sensitivity. Atopobium spp. levels had the most significant area under the curve.
TI  - Reciprocal interference between Lactobacillus spp. and Gardnerella vaginalis on initial adherence to epithelial cells.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder in women of child-bearing age. It is widely accepted that the microbial switch from normal microflora to the flora commonly associated with BV is characterized by a decrease in vaginal colonization by specific Lactobacillus species together with an increase of G. vaginalis and other anaerobes. However, the order of events leading to the development of BV remains poorly characterized and it is unclear whether the decrease in lactobacilli is a cause or a consequence of the increase in the population density of anaerobes. Our goal was to characterize the interaction between two Gardnerella vaginalis strains, one of which was isolated from a healthy woman (strain 5-1) and the other from a woman diagnosed with BV (strain 101), and vaginal lactobacilli on the adherence to cervical epithelial cells. In order to simulate the transition from vaginal health to BV, the lactobacilli were cultured with the epithelial cells first, and then the G. vaginalis strain was introduced. We quantified the inhibition of G. vaginalis adherence by the lactobacilli and displacement of adherent lactobacilli by G. vaginalis. Our results confirmed that pathogenic G vaginalis 101 had a higher capacity for adhesion to the cervical epithelial cells than strain 5-1. Interestingly, strain 101 displaced L. crispatus but not L. iners whereas strain 5-1 had less of an effect and did not affect the two species differently. Furthermore, L. iners actually enhanced adhesion of strain 101 but not of strain 5-1. These results suggest that BV-causing G. vaginalis and L. iners do not interfere with one another, which may help to explain previous reports that women who are colonized with L. iners are more likely to develop BV.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of initial adhesion of bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes to ME-180 cells.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the leading vaginal disorder but the transition from health to this dysbiotic condition remains poorly characterized. Our goal was to quantify the ability of BV-associated anaerobes to adhere to epithelial cells in the presence of lactobacilli. Gardnerella vaginalis outcompeted Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners actually enhanced its adherence.
TI  - The villain team-up or how Trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis alter innate immunity in concert.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Complex interactions of vaginal microorganisms with the genital tract epithelium shape mucosal innate immunity, which holds the key to sexual and reproductive health. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a microbiome-disturbance syndrome prevalent in reproductive-age women, occurs commonly in concert with trichomoniasis, and both are associated with increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes and viral infections, largely attributable to inflammation. To investigate the causative relationships among inflammation, BV and trichomoniasis, we established a model of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells colonised by vaginal Lactobacillus isolates, dominant in healthy women, and common BV species (Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia). METHODS: Colonised epithelia were infected with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) or exposed to purified TV virulence factors (membrane lipophosphoglycan (LPG), its ceramide-phosphoinositol-glycan core (CPI-GC) or the endosymbiont Trichomonas vaginalis virus (TVV)), followed by assessment of bacterial colony-forming units, the mucosal anti-inflammatory microbicide secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and chemokines that drive pro-inflammatory, antigen-presenting and T cells. RESULTS: TV reduced colonisation by Lactobacillus but not by BV species, which were found inside epithelial cells. TV increased interleukin (IL)-8 and suppressed SLPI, likely via LPG/CPI-GC, and upregulated IL-8 and RANTES, likely via TVV as suggested by use of purified pathogenic determinants. BV species A vaginae and G vaginalis induced IL-8 and RANTES, and also amplified the pro-inflammatory responses to both LPG/CPI-GC and TVV, whereas P bivia suppressed the TV/TVV-induced chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: These molecular host-parasite-endosymbiont-bacteria interactions explain epidemiological associations and suggest a revised paradigm for restoring vaginal immunity and preventing BV/TV-attributable inflammatory sequelae in women.
TI  - Plants traditionally used individually and in combination to treat sexually transmitted infections in northern Maputaland, South Africa: antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Although medicinal plants are used extensively to treat sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in rural northern Maputaland, KwaZulu-Natal, the efficacy and safety of these plants have not previously been evaluated. AIM OF STUDY: A study was designed to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity profiles of a selection (individual plants and selected combinations) of traditionally used plants in this study area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous and organic (dichloromethane: methanol, 1:1) extracts were prepared. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay against the STI associated pathogens; Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical strain, Oligella ureolytica ATCC 43534, Trichomonas vaginalis clinical strain, Gardnerella vaginalis ATCC 14018 and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 19424. For the combination study, interactions were assessed using the fractional inhibitory concentration (SigmaFIC). The plant species were assessed for safety using the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cellular viability assay on the human embryonic kidney epithelial (Graham, HEK-293) cell line. RESULTS: For the antimicrobial studies, U. urealyticum was the most sensitive of the six test organisms, with the aqueous extract of Ranunculus multifidus (0.02mg/ml) and the organic extract of Peltophorum africanum (0.04mg/ml) being the most antimicrobially active plant species studied. Sclerocarya birrea was found to have the broadest spectrum of activity (mean MIC of 0.89mg/ml). The only plant species to exhibit some degree of cytotoxicity against the kidney epithelial cell line was Kigelia africana (100microg/ml), with 22% and 16% cell death for the aqueous and organic extracts, respectively. Of the 13 combinations studied, several synergistic combinations were evident, the most prominent being the combination of Albizia adianthifolia and Trichilia dregeana (aqueous extract) with an SigmaFIC value of 0.15 against O. ureolytica. Synergistic interactions were observed regardless of the ratio of the aqueous mixtures of the two plants. Syzygium cordatum and S. birrea (aqueous extract) was also a combination of interest, demonstrating synergistic (SigmaFIC=0.42) interactions against O. ureolytica. This combination, however, also displayed some cytotoxicity towards the human epithelial cell line. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that anecdotal evidence of plant use does not always correlate with in vitro activity. Furthermore, the toxicological profiling is of utmost importance as if not combined in its correct ratio can lead to potential adverse effects.
TI  - ANOVA-like differential expression (ALDEx) analysis for mixed population RNA-Seq.
AB  - Experimental variance is a major challenge when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data. This variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability between biological conditions. The high per-sample cost of RNA-Seq often precludes the large number of experiments needed to partition observed variance into these categories as per standard ANOVA models. We show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored, whether in single-organism RNA-Seq or in Meta-RNA-Seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used RNA-Seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. These two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. As it is usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed ALDEx, an ANOVA-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. We show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even very small sample sizes.
TI  - Bacterial infections of the lower genital tract in fertile and infertile women from the southeastern Poland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to investigate the detection rates of  Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Enterococcus faecalis, showing no clinical signs of an ongoing, acute inflammatory state of the vagina and/or the cenrvix, in fertile and infertile women. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study encompassed 161 women, including 101 women treated for infertility and 60 fertile women who had already given birth to healthy children. The material for the presence of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, M. genitalium, M. hominis and U. urealyticum was collected from the cervical canal and analyzed by PCR. Furthermore, BD ProbeTec ET system was used to detect C. trachomatis infection. Vaginal swabs were collected for classification of bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis and assessed according to the Nugent score, as well as by traditional culture methods. RESULTS: U. urealyticum was identified in 9% of the infertile women and in 8% of controls. Presence of M. hominis was demonstrated only in the former (4%) and C. trachomatis only in latter (3%). N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium were not found in any of the examined women. The frequency of aerobic vaginitis in both groups was estimated at 12%. There were 7% bacterial vaginosis cases in the study group, and none in the control group (p=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: Despite having no symptoms of an ongoing acute inflammation of the reproductive tract, many women may experience permanent or periodic shifts of equilibrium of the vaginal and/or cervical microflora. BV develops more frequently in infertile patients when compared to the fertile women.
TI  - Profiles of ILY, VLY and Sm-hPAF interaction with human CD59.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular features of a new member of the bacterially -derived cytolysin family were examined. In particular, the interactive mechanisms of intermedilysin (ILY), vaginolysin (VLY), and Streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (Sm-hPAF) with human CD59 (hCD59) were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular models of VLY and Sm-hPAF were constructed based on X-ray data of ILY (protein data bank ID=1S3R), and their interactive profiles with hCD59 were examined using molecular simulation. RESULTS: Non-binding (NB) energy between ILY and hCD59 was three orders of magnitude higher than the energy between VLY and hCD59. NB energy between Sm-hPAF and hCD59 was similar to that between VLY and hCD59. CONCLUSION: A hydrogen bond (ILY Arg432-hCD59 Glu76) was observed between ILY and hCD59, and a stronger interaction was formed by flexible adjustment between them.
TI  - [Bacterial infection as a cause of infertility in humans].
AB  - Microorganisms which are present in the human urogenital tract may be involved in the development of inflammatory changes negatively affecting the genitals in both men and women. Pathological conditions due to inflammatory alterations may result in complete loss of fertility. Infections of the urogenital tract are responsible for 15% of all cases of infertility in couples. Negative impact on the human reproduction is mainly caused by direct damage to the genital tract mucosa by metabolic products of microorganisms or by induction of pro-inflammatory responses of the body. Another mechanism is indirect impact of microorganisms on the genital function. Moreover, the effect of bacteria on spermatogenesis and semen quality is important in men. Infections mainly caused by Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae represent the greatest risk in terms of permanent consequences for human reproduction. As for other sexually transmitted disorders, such as infections caused by Gardnerella vaginalis, urogenital mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas, the link between infection and infertility has been intensively researched.
TI  - Comparison of the vaginal microbiota diversity of women with and without human papillomavirus infection: a cross-sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The female genital tract is an important bacterial habitat of the human body, and vaginal microbiota plays a crucial role in vaginal health. The alteration of vaginal microbiota affects millions of women annually, and is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, previous studies have primarily focused on the association between bacterial vaginosis and HPV infection. Little is known about the composition of vaginal microbial communities involved in HPV acquisition. The present study was performed to investigate whether HPV infection was associated with the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota. METHODS: A total of 70 healthy women (32 HPV-negative and 38 HPV-positive) with normal cervical cytology were enrolled in this study. Culture-independent polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to measure the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota of all subjects. RESULTS: We found significantly greater biological diversity in the vaginal microbiota of HPV-positive women (p < 0.001). Lactobacillus, including L. gallinarum, L. iners and L. gasseri, was the predominant genus and was detected in all women. No significant difference between HPV-positive and HPV-negative women was found for the frequency of detection of L. gallinarum (p = 0.775) or L. iners (p = 0.717), but L. gasseri was found at a significantly higher frequency in HPV-positive women (p = 0.005). Gardnerella vaginalis was also found at a significantly higher frequency in HPV-positive women (p = 0.031). Dendrograms revealed that vaginal microbiota from the two groups had different profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first systematic evaluation of an association between vaginal microbiota and HPV infection, and we have demonstrated that compared with HPV-negative women, the bacterial diversity of HPV-positive women is more complex and the composition of vaginal microbiota is different.
TI  - Interactions between Lactobacillus crispatus and Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)-Associated Bacterial Species in Initial Attachment and Biofilm Formation.
AB  - Certain anaerobic bacterial species tend to predominate the vaginal flora during  bacterial vaginosis (BV), with Gardnerella vaginalis being the most common. However, the exact role of G. vaginalis in BV has not yet been determined. The main goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that G. vaginalis is an early colonizer, paving the way for intermediate (e.g., Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (e.g., Prevotella bivia). Theoretically, in order to function as an early colonizer, species would need to be able to adhere to vaginal epithelium, even in the presence of vaginal lactobacilli. Therefore, we quantified adherence of G. vaginalis and other BV-associated bacteria to an inert surface pre-coated with Lactobacillus crispatus using a new Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) methodology. We found that G. vaginalis had the greatest capacity to adhere in the presence of L. crispatus. Theoretically, an early colonizer would contribute to the adherence and/or growth of additional species, so we next quantified the effect of G. vaginalis biofilms on the adherence and growth of other BV-associated species by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) technique. Interestingly, G. vaginalis derived a growth benefit from the addition of a second species, regardless of the species. Conversely, G. vaginalis biofilms enhanced the growth of P. bivia, and to a minor extent of F. nucleatum. These results contribute to our understanding of BV biofilm formation and the progression of the disorder.
TI  - [Diagnosis of vaginitis-vaginosis by hibridization with DNA strands].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal infections lie among the most common causes women ask for medical advice. In order of frequency bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis are responsible for 90% of vaginitis/vaginosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a DNA hybridization test for simultaneous molecular detection of Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida species and Trichomonas vaginalis, as an alternative to conventional microbiological methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cohort, cross-sectional, and comparative study of 1,003 vaginal samples from symptomatic women from our health-care area. Two swabs were obtained from each woman, one for routine microbiological diagnosis of vaginal infection (wet mount, Gram stain, and mycological culture) and the other for the DNA hybridization test (Affirm VPIII, Becton Dickinson). This method detects clinically significant levels of G. vaginalis (2 x 10(5) CFU/ml), Candida spp. (1 x 10(4) cells) and T. vaginalis (5x103 trichomonads). RESULTS: Out of the 1,003 women studied, 30.6% tested positive for bacterial vaginosis, 23.3% for vulvovaginal candidiasis, and 0.5% for trichomoniasis. The Affirm VPIII method turned out positive in 27.5%, 27.4% and 0.5% of cases, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between the molecular technique and conventional methods for microbiological diagnosis of vaginitis/ vaginosis (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The Affirm VPIII test correlated well with wet mount, Gram stain and mycological culture. Although its cost is relatively high, it is fast, reproducible, easy, and can be done in either clinical laboratories or Gynecology offices, which permits prescribing a specific early treatment.
TI  - [Vaginal infections in pregnant women at the Regional Hospital of Sokode (Togo) in 2010 and 2011].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the major microorganisms causing vaginal infections in pregnant women consulting at the Regional Hospital of Sokode and to assess their sensitivity to antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study took place from June 2010 through August 2011 and included 302 pregnant women from whom a sample was taken by a vaginal swab. Samples were processed for parasitic, bacterial, and fungal agents, by microscopic examination and culture. RESULTS: We isolated 273 germs, alone or in association in 221 women. These germs were distributed as follows: Gardnerella vaginalis (55.31%), Candida spp (30.77%), Staphylococcus aureus (5.49%), Enterobacteriaceae (4.40%), Trichomonas vaginalis (3.66%) and Mobiluncus spp (0.37%). No Streptococcus strain was isolated during the study. Over 40% of women had bacterial vaginosis and 23.08% of them were coinfected. The occurrence of coinfection was statistically influenced by the stage of pregnancy (P = 0.05). The susceptibility tests revealed that S. aureus developed a strong resistance to aminopenicillins (66.67%) and cephalosporins (>44.44%), while Enterobacteriaceae was resistant to cephalosporins and quinolones. (16.67%). CONCLUSION: This study showed that pregnant women in Sokode are still exposed to vaginal infection, caused mostly by G. vaginalis and Candida species. These results underline the need for at least one vaginal swab culture for each woman during pregnancy.
TI  - Are plant extracts a potential therapeutic approach for genital infections?
AB  - More than 40% of the new drugs registered from 1981 to 2006 were obtained, derived or inspired from natural compounds. The influence of natural products in the anti-infective area is quite marked, being a great percentage of drugs derived or extracted from natural products. Vaginal infections are one of the most common reasons a women visits a gynecologist. Given the high popularity of natural therapies among women who suffer from chronic infections, it is urgent for women's healthcare providers to be knowledgeable about such therapies. Additionally, many phytotherapeutic products have been suggested as natural sources of antimicrobial compounds. The increased resistance to conventional antibiotics is one of the main factors justifying the search and development of new antimicrobial agents, especially those of natural origin. Currently, phytochemicals are considered by the scientific community as very attractive targets for potential drug discovery and therapy. In this review, we will focus on the most relevant reports published during the last twenty years about the antimicrobial activity of plant extracts upon microorganisms most frequently involved in genital infections, such as Candida spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Human papillomavirus. The relationship between their composition and the antimicrobial effects will be highlighted and vaginal therapeutic delivery systems that vehicle plant extracts both commercialized and under investigation will be included.
TI  - Sequences of multiple bacterial genomes and a Chlamydia trachomatis genotype from direct sequencing of DNA derived from a vaginal swab diagnostic specimen.
AB  - Ultra-deep Illumina sequencing was performed on whole genome amplified DNA derived from a Chlamydia trachomatis-positive vaginal swab. Alignment of reads with reference genomes allowed robust SNP identification from the C. trachomatis chromosome and plasmid. This revealed that the C. trachomatis in the specimen was very closely related to the sequenced urogenital, serovar F, clade T1 isolate F-SW4. In addition, high genome-wide coverage was obtained for Prevotella melaninogenica, Gardnerella vaginalis, Clostridiales genomosp. BVAB3 and Mycoplasma hominis. This illustrates the potential of metagenome data to provide high resolution bacterial typing data from multiple taxa in a diagnostic specimen.
TI  - In vitro probiotic properties of Lactobacillus fermentum SK5 isolated from vagina of a healthy woman.
AB  - A lactobacillus strain isolated from a vaginal tract of a healthy woman was examined in vitro for its probiotic potential. This strain, identified as Lactobacillus fermentum SK5, was able to survive at pH 3-4 and 0.1-0.2% bile, and unaffected by pepsin (3 g l(-1)) and pancreatin (1 g l(-1)), but was susceptible to all tested antibiotics except metronidazole. L. fermentum SK5 had an antimicrobial potential against gastrointestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli and vaginal pathogenic Gardnerella vaginalis. The effective substance was suspected to be a bacteriocin-like compound with a molecular weight of more than 10 kDa, but hydrogen peroxide was also detected. Further studies revealed that L. fermentum SK5 had good autoaggregation characteristic and a high surface hydrophobicity that enhanced its adhesion ability to epithelial cells and for biofilm formation. This lactobacillus showed coaggregation with E. coli and G. vaginalis to affect their adhesion and colonization. The adhesion of L. fermentum SK5 to HeLa, HT-29 and Caco-2 cells and its inhibition of E. coli and G. vaginalis adherence to these cells were demonstrated. These incidences provided evidence of the possible colonization of L. fermentum SK5 that would prevent binding and growth of E. coli and G. vaginalis onto intestinal and vaginal epithelial cells. On the basis of the ability of L. fermentum SK5 to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms through coaggregation and antimicrobial substances, it is likely that this lactobacillus strain could be a potential probiotic candidate for beneficial use in protecting against gastrointestinal and vaginal microbial infections.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  - The vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Some strains of S. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. We have observed that a female was mono-colonized with Enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. In recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. Thus, we hypothesized that this strain of E. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. E. faecalis MN1 inhibited interleukin-8 production from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. We further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8 production, as well as inhibition of T cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. Microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by E. faecalis MN1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis-associated bacterial vaginosis in Bulgarian women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women of reproductive age. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of BV in Bulgarian pregnant and nonpregnant women from several age ranges and to compare three different laboratory methods for Gardnerella vaginalis detection in patents suffering from BV. METHODS: Between September 2011 and June 2012, 809 women of 16-40 years of age separated in two major groups: nonpregnant - 469 (355 with and 114 without symptoms) and pregnant - 340 (213 and 127 respectively) were enrolled for the study. The women underwent three different laboratory tests simultaneously: scoring of Gram staining of vaginal smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for G. vaginalis. RESULTS: The microscopic method detected high frequency of BV in symptomatic (57%) whereas only a minority of asymptomatic subjects (14%) were detected. G. vaginalis-associated BV was diagnosed in approximately equal proportions when evaluated with PCR and microscopic method for both pregnant and nonpregnant women. The comparative analysis of microscopic evaluation, culture and PCR assays demonstrated greater concurrence (about 90%) between Gram staining and PCR detection for BV, than both methods compared to culture. The combination of microscopy and PCR turned out to be very reliable and repeatable for detecting G. vaginalis-associated BV. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comparative investigation on the epidemiology of G. vaginalis-associated BV in Bulgaria. The established highest frequency in the young Bulgarian women (21-30 years) is alarming and should be considered in prophylaxis and reproductive programmes.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ Hybridization method using Peptide Nucleic Acid probes for rapid detection of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella spp.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection occurring in women of reproductive age. It is widely accepted that the microbial switch from normal microflora to BV is characterized by a decrease in vaginal colonization by Lactobacillus species together with an increase of Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes. Our goal was to develop and optimize a novel Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) Fluorescence in situ Hybridization assay (PNA FISH) for the detection of Lactobacillus spp. and G. vaginalis in mixed samples. RESULTS: Therefore, we evaluated and validated two specific PNA probes by using 36 representative Lactobacillus strains, 22 representative G. vaginalis strains and 27 other taxonomically related or pathogenic bacterial strains commonly found in vaginal samples. The probes were also tested at different concentrations of G. vaginalis and Lactobacillus species in vitro, in the presence of a HeLa cell line. Specificity and sensitivity of the PNA probes were found to be 98.0% (95% confidence interval (CI), from 87.8 to 99.9%) and 100% (95% CI, from 88.0 to 100.0%), for Lactobacillus spp.; and 100% (95% CI, from 92.8 to 100%) and 100% (95% CI, from 81.5 to 100.0%) for G. vaginalis. Moreover, the probes were evaluated in mixed samples mimicking women with BV or normal vaginal microflora, demonstrating efficiency and applicability of our PNA FISH. CONCLUSIONS: This quick method accurately detects Lactobacillus spp. and G. vaginalis species in mixed samples, thus enabling efficient evaluation of the two bacterial groups, most frequently encountered in the vagina.
TI  - Composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age--sensitive and specific molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is possible?
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder, characterized by depletion of the normal lactobacillus-dominant microbiota and overgrowth of commensal anaerobic bacteria. This study aimed to investigate the composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age (healthy women and women with BV), with the view of developing molecular criteria for BV diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vaginal samples from 163 women (79 control, 73 BV and 11 intermediate (Lactobacillary grade II flora) cases) were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing of the hypervariable regions V3-V4 of the 16S rRNA gene and 16 quantitative bacterial species/genus-specific real-time PCR assays. Sensitivities and specificities of potential BV markers were computed using the Amsel criteria as reference standard for BV. The use of quantitative thresholds for prediction of BV, determined for both relative abundance measured with 454 pyrosequencing and bacterial load measured with qPCR, was evaluated. RESULTS: Relative to the healthy women, the BV patients had in their vaginal microbiota significantly higher prevalence, loads and relative abundances of the majority of BV associated bacteria. However, only Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Eggerthella, Prevotella, BVAB2 and Megasphaera type 1 detected at or above optimal thresholds were highly predictable for BV, with the best diagnostic accuracy shown for A. vaginae. The depletion of Lactobacillus species combined with the presence of either G. vaginalis or A. vaginae at diagnostic levels was a highly accurate BV predictor. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative determination of the presence of G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, Eggerthella, Prevotella, BVAB2 and Megasphaera type 1 as well as the depletion of Lactobacillus was highly accurate for BV diagnosis. Measurements of abundance of normal and BV microbiota relative to total bacteria in vaginal fluid may provide more accurate BV diagnosis, and be used for test-of-cure, rather than qualitative detection or absolute counts of BV related microorganisms.
TI  - Clinical features of bacterial vaginosis in a murine model of vaginal infection with Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a dysbiosis of the vaginal flora characterized by a shift from a Lactobacillus-dominant environment to a polymicrobial mixture including Actinobacteria and gram-negative bacilli. BV is a common vaginal condition in women and is associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. Gardnerella vaginalis is one of the most frequently isolated bacterial species in BV. However, there has been much debate in the literature concerning the contribution of G. vaginalis to the etiology of BV, since it is also present in a significant proportion of healthy women. Here we present a new murine vaginal infection model with a clinical isolate of G. vaginalis. Our data demonstrate that this model displays key features used clinically to diagnose BV, including the presence of sialidase activity and exfoliated epithelial cells with adherent bacteria (reminiscent of clue cells). G. vaginalis was capable of ascending uterine infection, which correlated with the degree of vaginal infection and level of vaginal sialidase activity. The host response to G. vaginalis infection was characterized by robust vaginal epithelial cell exfoliation in the absence of histological inflammation. Our analyses of clinical specimens from women with BV revealed a measureable epithelial exfoliation response compared to women with normal flora, a phenotype that, to our knowledge, is measured here for the first time. The results of this study demonstrate that G. vaginalis is sufficient to cause BV phenotypes and suggest that this organism may contribute to BV etiology and associated complications. This is the first time vaginal infection by a BV associated bacterium in an animal has been shown to parallel the human disease with regard to clinical diagnostic features. Future studies with this model should facilitate investigation of important questions regarding BV etiology, pathogenesis and associated complications.
TI  - Degradation, foraging, and depletion of mucus sialoglycans by the vagina-adapted  Actinobacterium Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial imbalance of the vaginal microbiota associated with reproductive infections, preterm birth, and other adverse health outcomes. Sialidase activity in vaginal fluids is diagnostic of BV and sialic acid-rich components of mucus have protective and immunological roles. However, whereas mucus degradation is believed to be important in the etiology and complications associated with BV, the role(s) of sialidases and the participation of individual bacterial species in the degradation of mucus barriers in BV have not been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the BV-associated bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis uses sialidase to break down and deplete sialic acid-containing mucus components in the vagina. Biochemical evidence using purified sialoglycan substrates supports a model in which 1) G. vaginalis extracellular sialidase hydrolyzes mucosal sialoglycans, 2) liberated sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) is transported into the bacterium, a process inhibited by excess N-glycolylneuraminic acid, and 3) sialic acid catabolism is initiated by an intracellular aldolase/lyase mechanism. G. vaginalis engaged in sialoglycan foraging in vitro, in the presence of human vaginal mucus, and in vivo, in a murine vaginal model, in each case leading to depletion of sialic acids. Comparison of sialic acid levels in human vaginal specimens also demonstrated significant depletion of mucus sialic acids in women with BV compared with women with a "normal" lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. Taken together, these studies show that G. vaginalis utilizes sialidase to support the degradation, foraging, and depletion of protective host mucus barriers, and that this process of mucus barrier degradation and depletion also occurs in the clinical setting of BV.
TI  - Vaginal biofilms and bacterial vaginosis: of mice and women.
AB  
TI  - DNase inhibits Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a highly prevalent and poorly understood polymicrobial disorder of the vaginal microbiota, with significant adverse sequelae. Gardnerella vaginalis predominates in bacterial vaginosis. Biofilms of G. vaginalis are present in human infections and are implicated in persistent disease, treatment failure, and transmission. Here we demonstrate that G. vaginalis biofilms contain extracellular DNA, which is essential to their structural integrity. Enzymatic disruption of this DNA specifically inhibits biofilms, acting on both newly forming and established biofilms. DNase liberates bacteria from the biofilm to supernatant fractions and potentiates the activity of metronidazole, an antimicrobial agent used in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Using a new murine vaginal colonization model for G. vaginalis, we demonstrate >10-fold inhibition of G. vaginalis colonization by DNase. We conclude that DNase merits investigation as a potential nonantibiotic adjunct to existing bacterial vaginosis therapies in order to decrease the risk of chronic infection, recurrence, and associated morbidities.
TI  - Characterization of the vaginal micro- and mycobiome in asymptomatic reproductive-age Estonian women.
AB  - The application of high-throughput sequencing methods has raised doubt in the concept of the uniform healthy vaginal microbiota consisting predominantly of lactobacilli by revealing the existence of more variable bacterial community composition. As this needs to be analyzed more extensively and there is little straightforward data regarding the vaginal mycobiome of asymptomatic women we aimed to define bacterial and fungal communities in vaginal samples from 494 asymptomatic, reproductive-age Estonian women. The composition of the vaginal microbiota was determined by amplifying bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1) regions and subsequently sequencing them using 454 Life Sciences pyrosequencing. We delineated five major bacterial community groups with distinctive diversity and species composition. Lactobacilli were among the most abundant bacteria in all groups, but also members of genus Gardnerella had high relative abundance in some of the groups. Microbial diversity increased with higher vaginal pH values, and was also higher when a malodorous discharge was present, indicating that some of the women who consider themselves healthy may potentially have asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV). Our study is the first of its kind to analyze the mycobiome that colonizes the healthy vaginal environment using barcoded pyrosequencing technology. We observed 196 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), including 16 OTUs of Candida spp., which is more diverse than previously recognized. However, assessing true fungal diversity was complicated because of the problems regarding the possible air-borne contamination and bioinformatics used for identification of fungal taxons as significant proportion of fungal sequences were assigned to unspecified OTUs.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis: Still a Prime Suspect in the Pathogenesis of Bacterial Vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal infection, yet its pathogenesis remains controversial. Although it has never been proven to be a sexually transmitted diseases the epidemiological evidence favoring this is quite robust. Although BV is characterized by its polymicrobial nature, it is highly likely that the inciting organism is Gardnerella vaginalis.
TI  - [Role and place of antibacterial therapy in prophylaxis of disturbances in reproductive function of women].
AB  - One-stage retrospective analysis of 350 primary medical documents of the female patients treated under hospital conditions for salpingo-oophoritis in 2010-2011 was performed. The results were compared with those of the investigation of the present etiological pattern of pelvic inflammatory diseases (PID) by the data of the microbiological examination of 117 patients with PID and susceptibility of the isolates to the antibacterials. The frequency and efficiency of the use of antibacterials alone or in combinations were analysed in the treatment of various clinical forms of PID. The ovarian reserve was estimated in 87 patients after recovery from salpingo-oophoritis. 52 of them had an episode of the chronic process exacerbation and 35 had the first episode of acute PID. The ovarian reserve was estimated by determination of the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), basal FSH level, ovarian volume and antral follicle count. A statistically significant decrease of the ovarian reserve in the patients with chronic salpingo-oophoritis confirmed the necessity of rational treatment of the acute inflammatory process.
TI  - Presence of a polymicrobial endometrial biofilm in patients with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the bacterial vaginosis biofilm extends into the upper female genital tract. STUDY DESIGN: Endometrial samples obtained during curettage and fallopian tube samples obtained during salpingectomy were collected. Endometrial and fallopian tube samples were analyzed for the presence of bacteria with fluorescence-in-situ-hybridisation (FISH) analysis with probes targeting bacterial vaginosis-associated and other bacteria. RESULTS: A structured polymicrobial Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm could be detected in part of the endometrial and fallopian tube specimens. Women with bacterial vaginosis had a 50.0% (95% CI 24.0-76.0) risk of presenting with an endometrial Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm. Pregnancy (AOR = 41.5, 95% CI 5.0-341.9, p<0.001) and the presence of bacterial vaginosis (AOR = 23.2, 95% CI 2.6-205.9, p<0.001) were highly predictive of the presence of uterine or fallopian bacterial colonisation when compared to non-pregnant women without bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSION: Bacterial vaginosis is frequently associated with the presence of a structured polymicrobial Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm attached to the endometrium. This may have major implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of adverse pregnancy outcome in association with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Pregnancy-induced changes in immune protection of the genital tract: defining normal.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Both the state of pregnancy as well as disruption of vaginal flora and immune mediators may increase the risk of human immunodeficiency virus-1 acquisition. The objective of this study was to define immune changes in lower genital and systemic immunity associated with normal pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort enrolled low-risk pregnant and nonpregnant women ages 18-35 years. Pregnant women at <14 weeks and nonpregnant women in follicular phase of the menstrual cycle were included. Cervical and vaginal fluid was collected. Concentrations of immune mediators were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based methods or multiplex immunoassay. Samples were inoculated onto various culture media allowing for growth of Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, anaerobic gram-negative rods, Candida, Staphylococcus aureus, Ureaplasma species, and Mycoplasma hominis. Concentrations of immune mediators and vaginal colonization frequencies were compared between the pregnant and nonpregnant groups. RESULTS: Genital tract concentration of interleukin-1beta was higher during pregnancy compared to nonpregnant participants. Serum C-reactive protein concentrations were higher in all trimesters of pregnancy. Concentrations of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor did not differ between groups. Lactobacillus was more commonly isolated from vaginal cultures of nonpregnant participants (100% vs 70.2%, P = .02). Identification of Candida, G vaginalis, M hominis, and S aureus was common and not different between groups. Ureaplasma species was isolated from >60% pregnant participants. CONCLUSION: The proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1beta, as well as the systemic marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein, are increased during pregnancy. The impact of these proinflammatory changes during pregnancy deserves further study.
TI  - The microbiota of the human genitourinary tract: trying to see the forest through the trees.
AB  - Based on traditional microbiological methods, namely cultivation and microscopic  analyses, the vaginal microbiota (VMB) has been defined as healthy when it is predominated by hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp., most prominently Lactobacillis crispatus. Similarly, the VMB has been defined as bacterial vaginosis (BV) when it is predominated by Gardnerella vaginalis as well as a number of other anaerobic bacterial species. BV is associated with a distinct vaginal discharge syndrome, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, post-operative wound infections, and endometritis after elective abortions. Additionally, BV predisposes women to infection by HIV as well as other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The application of molecular techniques over the last decade to studies of the VMB has significantly advanced our understanding of its structure and variation. It is now clear that the diversity of the VMB is far more complex than previously recognized; it is comprised of many heretofore unknown bacteria in addition to those previously identified by culture. Here we describe the application of 454 pyrosequencing technology to a study of vaginal specimens from 92 women attending the New Orleans STD clinic in an effort to obtain a more precise view of how different types of "trees" (bacteria) assemble to form a recognizable "forest" (VMB). This knowledge will be useful in the design of future clinical studies that investigate the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome influences human health and disease.
TI  - Insights into the CRISPR/Cas system of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gardnerella vaginalis is identified as the predominant colonist of the vaginal tracts of women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (BV). G. vaginalis can be isolated from healthy women, and an asymptomatic BV state is also recognised. The association of G. vaginalis with different clinical phenotypes could be explained by different cytotoxicity of the strains, presumably based on disparate gene content. The contribution of horizontal gene transfer to shaping the genomes of G. vaginalis is acknowledged. The CRISPR loci of the recently discovered CRISPR/Cas microbial defence system provide a historical view of the exposure of prokaryotes to a variety of foreign genetic elements. RESULTS: The CRISPR/Cas loci were analysed using available sequence data from three G. vaginalis complete genomes and 18 G. vaginalis draft genomes in the NCBI database, as well as PCR amplicons of the genomic DNA of 17 clinical isolates. The cas genes in the CRISPR/Cas loci of G. vaginalis belong to the E. coli subtype. Approximately 20% of the spacers had matches in the GenBank database. Sequence analysis of the CRISPR arrays revealed that nearly half of the spacers matched G. vaginalis chromosomal sequences. The spacers that matched G. vaginalis chromosomal sequences were determined to not be self-targeting and were presumably neither constituents of mobile-element-associated genes nor derived from plasmids/viruses. The protospacers targeted by these spacers displayed conserved protospacer-adjacent motifs. CONCLUSIONS: The CRISPR/Cas system has been identified in about one half of the analysed G. vaginalis strains. Our analysis of CRISPR sequences did not reveal a potential link between their presence and the virulence of the G. vaginalis strains. Based on the origins of the spacers found in the G. vaginalis CRISPR arrays, we hypothesise that the transfer of genetic material among G. vaginalis strains could be regulated by the CRISPR/Cas mechanism. The present study is the first attempt to determine and analyse the CRISPR loci of bacteria isolated from the human vaginal tract.
TI  - [GynOphilus--a winning relay].
AB  - The vagina is a complex biocenosis where many micro-organisms coexist and colonize it. The dominant colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual is of the genus "lactobacillus". It is also called Doderlein's bacillus and determines the vaginal microbial balance through the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, bacteriocines and modify the competition of pathogens for adhesion to the vaginal epithelial cells. Through these mechanisms the lactobacilli block the growth and development of other vaginal pathogenic microbial species and also inhibit the colonization of some other microorganisms imported from outside. Because of these potential therapeutic properties, the lactobacilli are used as effective medical agents for prophylaxys and therapy to restore the physiological balance in the vaginal eco-system. According to our studies and gained clinical experience the etiological antibacterial treatment is not always sufficient to restore the normal vaginal flora. The complete recovery of the vaginal flora could be reached using probiotics that are applied locally and per os. GynOphilus is a new vaginal probiotic product containing one type of the genus "Lactobacillus": Lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus. GynOphilus restores the physiological balance of the vaginal flora and reduces the risk of recurrent infection. The product is applied intravaginal and interacts locally, inhibits the growth of the most common vaginal pathogens: Gardnerella vaginalis u Candida albicans.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis. Treatment of the relapse].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. Bacterial vaginosis is an ecological disorder that ensues when normal lactobacilli are replaced by large numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., Mobiluncus sp. and M. hominis. Numerous studies have consistently shown that BV at 12-24 weeks are associated with increased risks of preterm birth (PTB), preterm rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, fetal infection and cerebral palsy. Deficiencies in local immunity may predispose women to BV.
TI  - The biofilm in bacterial vaginosis: implications for epidemiology, diagnosis and  treatment.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent evidence supports the view that bacterial vaginosis presents as a polymicrobial biofilm infection. This has far-reaching implications for the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial vaginosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Gardnerella vaginalis is presumably the first species to adhere to the vaginal epithelium and then becomes the scaffolding to which other species adhere. Not all G. vaginalis strains do form biofilms: G. vaginalis can be present in the vagina in a planktonic or in a biofilm mode of growth. The presence of planktonic (dispersed) or biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis can be reliably shown in urine sediments in both women and men, and there is an absolute concordance in the carriage of biofilm-associated (cohesive) G. vaginalis between women with bacterial vaginosis and their partners. In-vitro data suggest that selected probiotic lactobacilli might be an effective means to conquer the biofilm. SUMMARY: Future epidemiological research may benefit from biofilm-based urine diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis to a significant extent. The search for novel therapeutic agents can now be more directed towards the biofilm-breaking agents, but is at present hampered by the lack of a proper in-vitro model of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm.
TI  - Fetal membrane biomarker network diversity and disease functions induced by intra-amniotic pathogens.
AB  - PROBLEM: Intra-amniotic pathogens and by-products activate innate immune responses encompassing multitudes of signaling molecules and pathways that can result in spontaneous preterm birth (PTB). This study investigates fetal membrane response to bacterial stimulation using a bioinformatics approach. METHOD OF STUDY: Dysregulated biomarker (IL1-beta, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-alpha) data from fetal membranes at term stimulated with Ureaplasma urealyticum, Ureaplasma parvum, Mycoplasma hominis, E. coli, Group B Streptococci, Polyporhans gingivalis, or Gardnerella vaginalis with 50% (v/v) amniotic fluid (AF) were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: In racially stratified analysis, networks representing late-stage immune inflammation were seen in African-Americans in AF absence. Inflammation was dominant in AF presence as well. In Caucasians, late-stage immune response was dominant with AF, but not in its absence. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal membrane biofunctions in response to bacteria reflect early- and late-stage innate immune defenses that vary based on the presence of AF and subject race.
TI  - [Microscopic examination of vaginal discharge specimens for Trichomonas vaginalis and other micro-organisms in 18-45 age group women].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoon that causes trichomoniasis which  is characterised by a foamy yellowish odorous discharge and superficial defects and necrotic ulcers in vaginal mucosa. Trichomoniasis is transmitted from human to human by sexual contact and can be seen in almost every part of the world. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of Trichomonas vaginalis in 18-45 years age group women with vaginal discharge complaints who applied to the Gynaecology Outpatient Clinic of Konya Social Insurance Instution Hospital during September 1-December 15 2003. METHODS: Samples were taken from posterior fornix of the vagina with the aid of a speculum and sterile cotton swabs. All the samples were examined by wet mount preparations, Gram and Giemsa staining method under the light microscope. RESULTS: Of seventy samples 6 (9%) were positive for Trichomonas vaginalis, 9 (13%) for Gardnerella vaginalis, one for Mobiluncus spp. and 11 (16%) for Candida spp. CONCLUSION: It is possible to say that, in spite of a definite diagnosis of trichomoniasis made by cultivation method, examining the vaginal smear by direct microscope also has an important role in the diagnosis of infection. Direct microscopic examination will help in deciding whether to begin the treatment of trichomoniasis.
TI  - Effect of sexual debut on vaginal microbiota in a cohort of young women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis is uncommon in women who are virgins. We estimated effects of sexual debut on vaginal bacterial colonization. METHODS: Women who were virgins and aged 18-22 years enrolled in a study of human papillomavirus acquisition were followed every 4 months for up to 2 years. Vaginal swabs from before and after sexual debut or two independent visits for those remaining virgins were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis, and the bacterial vaginosis-associated species Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera species, Leptotrichia species, Sneathia species, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1, -2, and -3. RESULTS: We evaluated 97 women: 71 who became sexually active and 26 who remained virgins. At first sampling, 22 of 26 (85%) women who remained virgins were colonized with Lactobacillus species compared with 22 of 26 (85%) at follow-up (P>.99). G vaginalis was present in 12 of 26 (46%) initially and 11 of 26 (42%) at follow-up (P>.99). Among women who became sexually active, colonization with Lactobacillus species remained stable: 65 of 71 (92%) compared with 66 of 71 (93%) (P>.99), whereas colonization with G vaginalis increased (28 of 71 [39%] compared with 40 of 71 [56%]; P=.02). Among women who did not initiate sexual activity during the study, two of 26 (8%) had any bacterial vaginosis-associated species detected at both the first and second visits (P>.99). Among women who became sexually active during the study, 15 of 71 (21%) were colonized with bacterial vaginosis-associated species initially compared with 13 of 71 (18%) after sexual debut (P=.77). CONCLUSIONS: Among women who were virgins, vaginal colonization with bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterial species is uncommon and does not change after sexual debut.
TI  - The anti-HIV microbicide candidate RC-101 inhibits pathogenic vaginal bacteria without harming endogenous flora or mucosa.
AB  - PROBLEM: Vaginal microbicides represent a promising approach for preventing heterosexual HIV transmission. However, preclinical evaluation should be conducted to ensure that microbicides will be safe for human cells and healthy microflora of the female reproductive tract. One microbicide candidate, RC-101, has been effective and well tolerated in preliminary cell culture and macaque models. However, the effect of RC-101 on primary vaginal tissues and resident vaginal microflora requires further evaluation. METHOD OF STUDY: We treated primary vaginal tissues and vaginal bacteria, both pathogenic and commensal, with RC-101 to investigate effects of this microbicide. RESULTS: RC-101 was well tolerated by host tissues, and also by commensal vaginal bacteria. Simultaneously, pathogenic vaginal bacteria, which are known to increase susceptibility to HIV acquisition, were inhibited by RC-101. CONCLUSIONS: By establishing vaginal microflora, the specific antibacterial activity of RC-101 may provide a dual mechanism of HIV protection. These findings support advancement of RC-101 to clinical trials.
TI  - A deeper analysis of the epitope/paratope of PLY-5, a mouse monoclonal antibody which recognises the conserved undecapeptide tryptophan-rich loop (ECTGLAWEWWR) of bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - A previous study showed that the minimal epitope recognised by the PLY-5 mAb in the conserved undecapeptide Trp-rich loop of bacterial CDCs should consist of WEWWRT (Jacobs et al., 1999) [5]. Now, through immunoscreening of amino acid substitution analogues, it is concluded that the second Trp and the Arg residues are essential in the PLY-5 epitope. The E residue is an auxiliary epitope contributor. Antibody modelling and docking simulations provided support for these findings. For recognition by the antibody, the Trp-rich loop flipped out, mimicking the mechanism of membrane insertion. The displaced second Trp was seen to establish aromatic stacking interactions with aromatic residues of the antibody paratope and the notably extruded guanidium tip of the arginine residue mediated electrostatic interactions with well-exposed carboxylic groups of glutamic residues on the surface of the paratope. Thus, the epitope/paratope interaction is mainly mediated by aromatic and by ionic interactions.
TI  - In silico vs in vitro analysis of primer specificity for the detection of Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae and Lactobacillus spp.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common pathology of women in reproductive age that can lead to serious health complications, and is associated with shifts in the normal microflora from predominance of Lactobacillus spp. to a proliferation of other anaerobes such as G. vaginalis and A vaginae, which can be detected by PCR. The optimal PCR pathogen detection assay relies mainly on the specificity and sensitivity of the primers used. FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that in silico analytical testing of primer specificity is not a synonym to in vitro analytical specificity by testing a range of published and newly designed primers with both techniques for the detection of BV-associated microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: By testing primer in vitro specificity with a sufficient range of bacterial strains, we were able to design primers with higher specificity and sensitivity. Also by comparing the results obtained for the newly designed primers with other previously published primers, we confirmed that in silico analysis is not sufficient to predict in vitro specificity. As such care must be taken when choosing the primers for a detection assay.
TI  - Pseudoscardovia suis gen. nov., sp. nov., a new member of the family Bifidobacteriaceae isolated from the digestive tract of wild pigs (Sus scrofa).
AB  - Seventeen fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive bacterial strains were isolated from the digestive tract of wild pigs (Sus scrofa). Most of them were identified as Bifidobacterium boum according to sequences of 16S rRNA gene. Two strains isolated from the small intestine content had unusual morphology of cells in comparison with bifidobacteria. Cells growing in liquid anaerobic media were regular shaped rods arranged mostly in pairs. These isolates showed relatively low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities (maximum identity of 94%) to members of the family Bifidobacteriaceae. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, hsp60 and xfp gene sequences revealed that these strains are more related to recently described Neoscardovia, Aeriscardovia and other scardovial genera, than to Bifidobacterium species. Partial gene sequences of other phylogenetic markers showed low (65.8-89.5%) similarities to genome sequences of bifidobacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis. The major fatty acids detected in cells of the representative strain DPTE4(T) were C(16:0), C(18:1), C(14:0). The peptidoglycan type of the DPTE4(T) strain was A3betal-Orn(l-Lys)-l-Ser(l-Ala)-l-Ala(2). Polar lipid analysis revealed two phosphoglycolipids and phospholipids, a glycolipid and diphosphatidylglycerol. The results of phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic analyses support the proposal of a novel taxa, Pseudoscardovia suis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain=DPTE4(T)=DSM 24744(T)=CCM 7942(T)).
TI  - Simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  - Our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assay. We have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. In this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. The 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were Trichomonas vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. Two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. The method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. In a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in Sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the 14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.
TI  - Phase I randomized safety study of twice daily dosing of acidform vaginal gel: candidate antimicrobial contraceptive.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acidform gel, an acid-buffering product that inactivates spermatozoa, may be an effective topical non-hormonal contraceptive. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of vaginal dosing and effects of Acidform on mucosal immune mediators, antimicrobial properties of genital secretions, and vaginal microbiota. METHODS: Thirty-six sexually abstinent U.S. women were randomized to apply Acidform or hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) placebo gel twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Safety was assessed by symptoms and pelvic examination. The impact of gel on mucosal immunity was assessed by quantifying cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial proteins and antimicrobial activity of genital secretions collected by cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) at screening, 2 hours after gel application, and on days 7, 14 and 21. Vaginal microbiota was characterized at enrollment and day 14 using species-specific quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS: The median vaginal and cervical pH was significantly lower 2 hours after application of Acidform and was associated with an increase in the bactericidal activity of CVL against E. coli. However, 65% of women who received Acidform had at least one local adverse event compared with 11% who received placebo (p = 0.002). While there was no increase in inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, CVL concentrations of lactoferrin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), an anti-inflammatory protein, were significantly lower following Acidform compared to HEC placebo gel application. There were no significant changes in Lactobacillus crispatus or Lactobacillus jensenii in either group but there was a decrease in Gardnerella vaginalis in the Acidform group (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Acidform gel may augment mucosal defense as evidenced by an increase in bactericidal activity of genital secretions against E. coli and a decrease in Gardnerella vaginalis colonization. However, Acidform was associated with more irritation than placebo and lower levels of antimicrobial (lactoferrin) and anti-inflammatory (IL-1ra) proteins. These findings indicate the need for additional safety studies of this candidate non-hormonal contraceptive. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00850837.
TI  - Longitudinal qPCR study of the dynamics of L. crispatus, L. iners, A. vaginae, (sialidase positive) G. vaginalis, and P. bivia in the vagina.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To obtain more detailed understanding of the causes of disturbance of the vaginal microflora (VMF), a longitudinal study was carried out for 17 women during two menstrual cycles. METHODS: Vaginal swabs were obtained daily from 17 non-pregnant, menarchal volunteers. For each woman, Gram stains were scored, the quantitative changes of 5 key vaginal species, i.e. Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus crispatus, L. iners, (sialidase positive) Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia were quantified with qPCR and hydrogen-peroxide production was assessed on TMB+ agar. RESULTS: Women could be divided in 9 subjects with predominantly normal VMF (grades Ia, Ib and Iab, group N) and 8 with predominantly disturbed VMF (grades I-like, II, III and IV, group D). VMF was variable between women, but overall stable for most of the women. Menses were the strongest disturbing factor of the VMF. L. crispatus was present at log7-9 cells/ml in grade Ia, Iab and II VMF, but concentrations declined 100-fold during menses. L. crispatus below log7 cells/ml corresponded with poor H(2)O(2)-production. L. iners was present at log 10 cells/ml in grade Ib, II and III VMF. Sialidase negative G. vaginalis strains (average log5 cells/ml) were detected in grade I, I-like and IV VMF. In grade II VMF, predominantly a mixture of both sialidase negative and positive G. vaginalis strains (average log9 cells/ml) were present, and predominantly sialidase positive strains in grade III VMF. The presence of A. vaginae (average log9 cells/ml) coincided with grade II and III VMF. P. bivia (log4-8 cells/ml) was mostly present in grade III vaginal microflora. L. iners, G. vaginalis, A. vaginae and P. bivia all increased around menses for group N women, and as such L. iners was considered a member of disturbed VMF. CONCLUSIONS: This qPCR-based study confirms largely the results of previous culture-based, microscopy-based and pyrosequencing-based studies.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms to natural antimicrobials subtilosin, epsilon-poly-L-lysine, and lauramide arginine ethyl ester.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection associated with numerous gynecological and obstetric complications. This condition is characterized by the presence of thick adherent vaginal biofilms, composed mainly of Gardnerella vaginalis. This organism is thought to be the primary aetiological cause of the infection paving the way for various opportunists to colonize the niche. Previously, we reported that the natural antimicrobials subtilosin, epsilon-poly-L-lysine, and lauramide arginine ethyl ester selectively inhibit the growth of this pathogen. In this study, we used plate counts to evaluate the efficacy of these antimicrobials against established biofilms of G. vaginalis. Additionally, we validated and compared two rapid methods (ATP viability and resazurin assays) for the assessment of cell viability in the antimicrobial-treated G. vaginalis biofilms. Out of the tested antimicrobials, lauramide arginine ethyl ester had the strongest bactericidal effect, followed by subtilosin, with clindamycin and polylysine showing the weakest effect. In comparison to plate counts, ATP viability and resazurin assays considerably underestimated the bactericidal effect of some antimicrobials. Our results indicate that these assays should be validated for every new application.
TI  - Amniotic fluid and maternal race influence responsiveness of fetal membranes to bacteria.
AB  - Spontaneous preterm birth (PTB) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pPROM) occur more frequently in African-American women than in other racial groups. This may be due to an enhanced inflammatory response to pathogens associated with the condition. It is also possible that amniotic fluid (AF) has different immunomodulatory properties in African-American women that increase their risk of PTB and pPROM. To test this, we cultured fetal membranes from European-American and African-American women with sterile medium (control), Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Group B streptococci (GBS), Polyporphorans gingivalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum or Ureaplasma parvum in the presence and absence of 50% autologous AF. Cytokine concentrations were quantified in the conditioned medium. All bacterial species increased IL-8 production. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production were stimulated by LPS, E. coli, and G. vaginalis compared with control, but responses to Group B streptococci and P. gingivalis were limited to IL-1beta and TNF-alpha respectively. Genital mycoplasmas stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-10 but had no effect on IL-1beta production. African-Americans had twice the IL-1beta response to E. coli as European-Americans (P=0.031). Conversely, European-Americans produced more IL-8 in response to LPS than African-Americans (P=0.026). AF had both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that varied between races and pathogens. These results suggest that the host response to fetal membrane infections is complex and not generalizable. Interventions to prevent PTB and pPROM may need to be customized based on a patient's race, type of bacterial infection and factors in her AF.
TI  - Association between Trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. Prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by Lactobacillus species (L. iners, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (CST) IV) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of Atopobium, Prevotella, Parvimonas, Sneathia, Gardnerella, Mobiluncus, and other taxa. We sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and Trichomonas vaginalis. METHODS: Self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. T. vaginalis screening was performed using PCR targeting the 18S rRNA and beta-tubulin genes. Vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes. A panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype T. vaginalis. The association between vaginal microbiota and T. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. RESULTS: T. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). Of the 11 T. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as CST-IV, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by L. iners, and 1 (9%) as L. crispatus-dominated (P = 0.05). CST-IV microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting T. vaginalis compared with women in the L. crispatus-dominated state (OR: 8.26, 95% CI: 1.07-372.65). Seven of the 11 T. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. CONCLUSION: T. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of Mycoplasma, Parvimonas, Sneathia, and other anaerobes.
TI  - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) from Chlamydia trachomatis versus PID from Neisseria gonorrhea: from clinical suspicion to therapy.
AB  - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is the most significant complication of sexually transmitted infections in childbearing-age women and it represents an important public health problem because of its long-term sequelae (chronic pelvic pain, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy). Prior to the mid 1970s PID was considered a monoetiologic infection, due primarily to Neisseria gonorrhea. Now it is well documented as a polymicrobial process, with a great number of microrganisms involved. In addition to Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis, other vaginal microrganisms (anaerobes, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae, enteric Gram negative rods, Streptococco agalactie, Mycoplasma genitalium) also have been associated with PID. There is a wide variation in PID clinical features; the type and severity of symptoms vary by microbiologic etiology. Women who have chlamydial PID seem more likely than women who have gonococcal PID to be asymptomatic. Since clinical diagnosis is imprecise, the suspicion of PID should be confirmed by genital assessment for signs of inflammation or infection, blood test and imaging evaluation. Laparoscopic approach is considered the gold standard. According to the polymicrobial etiology of PID, antibiotic treatment must provide broad spectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Early administration of antibiotics is necessary to reduce the risk of long-term sequelae.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis as a rare cause of prosthetic joint infection.
AB  - We describe a septic loosening of a hip prosthesis in a 71-year-old woman caused  by Gardnerella vaginalis. Infection was confirmed by culture and molecular identification of this bacterium. The patient was treated by a one-step exchange of prosthesis and antibiotic therapy combining trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin, with favorable evolution.
TI  - Bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane Toll-like receptor expression.
AB  - PROBLEM: Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pPROM) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (PTB) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection and inflammation. The membranes may sense and respond to microbes via Toll-like receptors (TLRs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation in this tissue. The objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of TLRs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and PTB. METHOD OF STUDY: Normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. After 24 hrs, RNA was extracted and quantitative RT-PCR performed for TLRs1-10. RESULTS: Treatment of fetal membranes with Mycoplasma hominis increased expression of TLR4, TLR6, and TLR8 mRNA. Ureaplasma parvum upregulated TLR8 mRNA, and Porphyromonas gingivalis significantly increased fetal membrane TLR7 expression. In contrast, treatment with Gram-negative Escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated TLR10 mRNA. No effect was detected for Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, or Group B Streptococcus. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane TLR expression patterns. Moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pPROM and PTB, arise.
TI  - Preserved ex vivo inflammatory status in decidual cells from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the inflammatory response preserved ex vivo by decidual cells isolated from women who experienced preterm labor with and without subclinical intrauterine infection. METHODS: Fetal membranes were obtained after cesarean section from 35 women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor, with no clinical evidence of intrauterine infection. Decidua was microbiologically tested and cultured. Concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-8, MMP-9) were measured in the supernatants using Bio-Plex, and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: Subclinical infection was confirmed in 10 women (28.5%). Microorganisms isolated were Ureaplasma urealyticum (4), group B streptococci (3), Gardnerella vaginalis (1), and Escherichia coli (2). We found a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines in supernatants from decidual cells obtained from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection compared to women without infection. Secretion of MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-9 and PGE(2) was significantly higher in infected women. Secretion of IL-8 by decidual cells from infected women persisted upon repeated in vitro culture passages. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 30% of idiopathic preterm labor cases were associated with subclinical intrauterine infection, and decidual cells isolated from these cases preserved an ex vivo inflammatory status after in vivo bacterial exposure.
TI  - Resolution and characterization of distinct cpn60-based subgroups of Gardnerella  vaginalis in the vaginal microbiota.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV), characterized by a shift of the vaginal microbiota from a Lactobacillus-dominated community to a dense biofilm containing a complex mixture of organisms, is an important risk factor in poor reproductive health outcomes. The Nugent score, based on Gram stain, is used to diagnose BV and Gardnerella vaginalis abundance in the sample is one factor determining Nugent score. A high Nugent score is indicative of BV but does not always correspond to the presence of clinical symptoms. G. vaginalis is recognized as a heterogeneous group of organisms, which can also be part of the normal, healthy vaginal microbiome. In addition, asymptomatic BV and non-Gardnerella types of BV are being recognized. In an attempt to resolve the heterogeneous group of G. vaginalis, a phylogenetic tree of cpn60 universal target sequences from G. vaginalis isolates was constructed that indicates the existence of four subgroups of G. vaginalis. This subdivision, supported by whole genome similarity calculation of representative strains using JSpecies, demonstrates that these subgroups may represent different species. The cpn60 subgroupings did not correspond with the Piot biotyping scheme, but did show consistency with ARDRA genotyping and sialidase gene presence. Isolates from all four subgroups produced biofilm in vitro. We also investigated the distribution of G. vaginalis subgroups in vaginal samples from Kenyan women with Nugent scores consistent with BV, Intermediate and Normal microbiota (n = 44). All subgroups of G. vaginalis were detected in these women, with a significant difference (z = -3.372, n = 39, p = 0.001) in frequency of G. vaginalis subgroup B between BV and Normal groups. Establishment of a quantifiable relationship between G. vaginalis subgroup distribution and clinical status could have significant diagnostic implications.
TI  - Retrocyclin inhibits Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm formation and toxin activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retrocyclins are cyclic antimicrobial peptides that have been shown to be both broadly active and safe in animal models. RC-101, a synthetic retrocyclin, targets important human pathogens and is a candidate vaginal microbicide. Its activity against microbes associated with bacterial vaginosis is unknown. METHODS: We investigated the effect of RC-101 on toxin activity, bacterial growth and biofilm formation of Gardnerella vaginalis in vitro. RESULTS: RC-101 potently inhibits the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin, the Gardnerella vaginalis toxin, on both erythrocytes and nucleated cells. RC-101 lacks inhibitory activity against planktonic G. vaginalis but markedly decreases biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: These dual properties, toxin inhibition and biofilm retardation, justify further exploration of RC-101 as a candidate agent for bacterial vaginosis prevention.
TI  - Bacteremia of Gardnerella vaginalis after endometrial ablation.
AB  
TI  - Mode of action and safety of lactosporin, a novel antimicrobial protein produced  by Bacillus coagulans ATCC 7050.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the mechanism of action of antimicrobial protein, lactosporin, against Gardnerella vaginalis and to evaluate its safety in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacillus coagulans ATCC 7050 was grown at 37 degrees C for 18 h. The cell-free supernatant was concentrated 10-fold and screened for antimicrobial activity against indicator strain Micrococcus luteus. The mode of action of lactosporin was determined by measuring the potassium release and monitoring the changes in transmembrane potential (Deltapsi) and transmembrane pH (DeltapH) of the sensitive cells. Lactosporin caused the efflux of potassium ions from M. luteus cells and dissipation of DeltapH in G. vaginalis, while it had no effect on the Deltapsi. The safety of lactosporin was evaluated by using EpiVaginal() ectocervical (VEC-100) tissue model. Over 80% of the cells in the vaginal tissue remained viable after exposure to lactosporin for 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Lactosporin potentially exerts its antimicrobial activity by selective dissipation of DeltapH and/or by causing leakage of ions from the sensitive cells. Safety studies suggest that lactosporin is a noncytotoxic antimicrobial for vaginal application. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed that lactosporin is an effective and safe antimicrobial preparation with potential application for the control of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Presence of high-grade intraepithelial lesions among women deprived of their liberty: a documental study.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the results of the Pap smears of women deprived of their liberty. It is a retrospective, documental study, with a quantitative approach, performed in a female prison of Ceara, Brazil, with a sample of 672 patient records. Regarding the microbiological findings, it was verified that the main cervical-vaginal colonization was by bacilli suggestive of Gardnerella/Mobiluncus (21.8%), followed by Trichomonas vaginalis (12%), and Candida sp (5.8%). The frequencies of samples with atypical cells presented rates of 4.1% for Atypical Cells of Undetermined Significance; 3.2% for Low-grade Intraepithelial Lesions; and 2.5% for High-grade Intraepithelial Lesions. The importance of screening for cervical cancer in female prisons was highlighted, as well as the inclusion of the nurse in this environment, ensuring individualized, quality care for women deprived of their liberty.
TI  - Comparative genomic analyses of 17 clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis provide evidence of multiple genetically isolated clades consistent with subspeciation into genovars.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is associated with a spectrum of clinical conditions, suggesting high degrees of genetic heterogeneity among stains. Seventeen G. vaginalis isolates were subjected to a battery of comparative genomic analyses to determine their level of relatedness. For each measure, the degree of difference among the G. vaginalis strains was the highest observed among 23 pathogenic bacterial species for which at least eight genomes are available. Genome sizes ranged from 1.491 to 1.716 Mb; GC contents ranged from 41.18% to 43.40%; and the core genome, consisting of only 746 genes, makes up only 51.6% of each strain's genome on average and accounts for only 27% of the species supragenome. Neighbor-grouping analyses, using both distributed gene possession data and core gene allelic data, each identified two major sets of strains, each of which is composed of two groups. Each of the four groups has its own characteristic genome size, GC ratio, and greatly expanded core gene content, making the genomic diversity of each group within the range for other bacterial species. To test whether these 4 groups corresponded to genetically isolated clades, we inferred the phylogeny of each distributed gene that was present in at least two strains and absent in at least two strains; this analysis identified frequent homologous recombination within groups but not between groups or sets. G. vaginalis appears to include four nonrecombining groups/clades of organisms with distinct gene pools and genomic properties, which may confer distinct ecological properties. Consequently, it may be appropriate to treat these four groups as separate species.
TI  - Gardnerella, Trichomonas and Candida in cervical smears of 58,904 immigrants participating in the Dutch national cervical screening program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the prevalence of Gardnerella, Trichomonas and Candida in the cervical smears of 9 immigrant groups participating in the Dutch national cervical screening program. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical smears were taken from 58,904 immigrant participants and 498,405 Dutch participants. As part of the routine screening process, all smears were screened for the overgrowth of Gardnerella (i.e. smears with an abundance of clue cells) and for the presence of Trichomonas and Candida. The smears were screened by 6 laboratories, all of which use the Dutch KOPAC coding system. The odds ratio and confidence interval were calculated for the 9 immigrant groups and compared to Dutch participants. RESULTS: Immigrants from Suriname, Turkey and the Dutch Antilles have a 2-5 times higher prevalence of Gardnerella and Trichomonas when compared to native Dutch women. Interestingly, the prevalence of Trichomonas in cervical smears of Moroccan immigrants is twice as high, yet the prevalence of Gardnerella is 3 times lower than in native Dutch women. CONCLUSIONS: Immigrants with a high prevalence of Gardnerella also have a high prevalence of Trichomonas. In the context of the increased risk of squamous abnormalities in smears with Gardnerella, such slides should be screened with extra care.
TI  - Characteristics of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against Gardnerella vaginalis by Lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (BV), and to select one of the better Lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive G. vaginalis isolates. A total of 24 isolates from women with and without BV were identified as G. vaginalis. A higher frequency (P<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with BV (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). A total of 86 strains of Lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with BV. Lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (P<0.05) in healthy women (97.5%) than in women with BV (76.7%). Lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with BV. Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. In vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the G. vaginalis strains isolated from women with BV and from healthy women. Lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with BV. Concerning the indicator strains, G. vaginalis found in women with BV was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when Lactobacillus isolates from women with BV were used as producer strains. A high vaginal population level of G. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. A tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of G. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an L. johnsonii strain. Concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of G. vaginalis-associated BV depends in part on a simultaneous presence of Lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a G. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to this antagonism. The results could also explain why G. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.
TI  - Development and validation of a semiquantitative, multitarget PCR assay for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Quantitative PCR assays were developed for 4 organisms reported previously to be  useful positive indicators for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV)--Atopobium vaginae, Bacterial Vaginosis-Associated Bacterium 2 (BVAB-2), Gardnerella vaginalis, and Megasphaera-1--and a single organism (Lactobacillus crispatus) that has been implicated as a negative indicator for BV. Vaginal samples (n = 169), classified as positive (n = 108) or negative (n = 61) for BV based on a combination of the Nugent Gram stain score and Amsel clinical criteria, were analyzed for the presence and quantity of each of the marker organisms, and the results were used to construct a semiquantitative, multiplex PCR assay for BV based on detection of 3 positive indicator organisms (A. vaginae, BVAB-2, and Megasphaera-1) and classification of samples using a combinatorial scoring system. The prototype BV PCR assay was then used to analyze the 169-member developmental sample set and, in a prospective, blinded manner, an additional 227 BV-classified vaginal samples (110 BV-positive samples and 117 BV-negative samples). The BV PCR assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 96.7% (202/209), a specificity of 92.2% (153/166), a positive predictive value of 94.0%, and a negative predictive value of 95.6%, with 21 samples (5.3%) classified as indeterminate for BV. This assay provides a reproducible and objective means of evaluating critical components of the vaginal microflora in women with signs and symptoms of vaginitis and is comparable in diagnostic accuracy to the conventional gold standard for diagnosis of BV.
TI  - [Possible role of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  - Vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. It is due to several causes, some even unknown. Bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. They have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. The identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. In 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus, Candida albicans, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Streptococcus agalactiae. B. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. These strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees C in anaerobe chambers. Supernatant activity was assayed in HT-29 cells. Eighteen B. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. It was not identified in healthy women (P < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic B. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. This fact suggests that enterotoxigenic B. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. The effect of enterotoxin on E-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. This is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.
TI  - Extravaginal reservoirs of vaginal bacteria as risk factors for incident bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) represents shifts in microbiota from Lactobacillus spp. to diverse anaerobes. Although antibiotics relieve symptoms and temporarily eradicate BV-associated bacteria (BVAB), BV usually recurs. We investigated the role of extravaginal BVAB reservoirs in recurrence. METHODS: Risks for BV acquisition over the course of 1 year were defined. DNA in vaginal, anal, and oral swab samples from enrollment was subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16S ribosomal RNA genes of Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus crispatus, BVAB1, BVAB2, BVAB3, Megasphaera spp., Lactobacillus jensenii, and Leptotrichia/Sneathia spp. A case-control approach analyzed BVAB detection at enrollment for case patients (BV acquisition) versus controls (none). RESULTS: Of 239 women enrolled without BV, 199 were seen in follow-up, and 40 experienced BV; 15 had all samples for analysis. Detection of G. vaginalis in oral cavity or anal samples and Leptotrichia/Sneathia spp. in anal samples was more common at enrollment among case patients, who also had higher concentrations of these bacteria and Megasphaera relative to 30 controls at each site. In contrast, L. crispatus was detected more frequently in anal samples among controls. CONCLUSIONS: Women who acquire BV are more likely have previous colonization of extravaginal reservoirs with some BVAB, and less likely to have L. crispatus, suggesting that BVAB may be acquired vaginally from extravaginal reservoirs.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of Atopobium vaginae for dequalinium chloride.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis are major markers for bacterial vaginosis. We aimed to determine the MIC and MBC range of the broad-spectrum anti-infective and antiseptic dequalinium chloride for 28 strains, belonging to 4 species of the genus Atopobium, i.e. A. vaginae, A. minutum, A. rimae and A. parvulum. METHODS: The MIC was determined with a broth microdilution assay. RESULTS: The MIC and MBC for Atopobium spp. for dequalinium chloride ranged between < 0.0625 and 2 mug/ml. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that dequalinium chloride inhibits and kills clinical isolates of A. vaginae at concentrations similar to those of clindamycin and lower than those of metronidazole.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from cases of bacterial  vaginosis].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gardnerella vaginalis is one of the dominant etiological factors related to bacterial vaginosis. Literature offers a growing number of reports revealing there appear Gardnerella vaginalis strains increasingly resistant to metronidazole. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis to metronidazole, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The investigation was performed on collection of 67 Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from the group of 604 women participating in the study Antibiotic sensitivity of strains was verified by E-test method (BioMerieux). Interpretation of results was performed in accordance with EUCAST criteria. RESULTS: All tested strains, apart from one, were sensitive to clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The results of susceptibility test to metronidazole indicated that 68.7% (46 out of 67 strains) were resistant to this antibiotic, while all of them were sensitive to both clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Near future may bring the need to change the treatment regimen of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Inguinal syndrome secondary to Prevotella bivia after accidental bite in orogenital sex.
AB  - The authors report a case of an inguinal bubo in a young man caused by an anaerobe, Prevotella bivia, which was acquired during oral sexual intercourse. As far as the authors know, this is the first reported case of a sexually transmitted infection by Prevotella. Prevotella spp. inhabit the oral cavity and are highly prevalent in bacterial vaginosis, a polymicrobial syndrome resulting from replacement of the normal vaginal Lactobacillus spp. flora by high concentrations of anaerobic microorganisms such as Prevotella spp., Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and other uncultivated anaerobes.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) candidate bacteria: associations with BV and behavioural practices in sexually-experienced and inexperienced women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years several new fastidious bacteria have been identified  that display a high specificity for BV; however no previous studies have comprehensively assessed the behavioural risk associations of these bacterial vaginosis-candidate organisms (BV-COs). METHODS: We examined the associations between 8 key previously described BV-COs and BV status established by Nugent's score (NS). We also examined the sexual practices associated with each BV-CO. We incorporated 2 study populations: 193 from a sexually-inexperienced university population and 146 from a highly sexually-active clinic population. Detailed behavioural data was collected by questionnaire and vaginal smears were scored by the Nugent method. Stored samples were tested by quantitative PCR assays for the 8 BV-COs: Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Leptotrichia spp., Megasphaera type I, Sneathia spp., and the Clostridia-like bacteria BVAB1, BVAB2 and BVAB3. Associations between BV-COs and BV and behaviours were examined by univariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, all BV-COs were more common in BV compared to normal flora. However, only Megasphaera type I, BVAB2, A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were significantly independently associated with BV by multivariable analysis. Six of the eight BV-COs (Megasphaera type I, BVAB2, BVAB3, Sneathia, Leptotrichia and G. vaginalis) were rare or absent in sexually-unexposed women, and demonstrated increasing odds of detection with increasing levels of sexual activity and/or numbers of lifetime sexual partners. Only G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were commonly detected in sexually-unexposed women. Megasphaera type I was independently associated with women-who-have-sex-with women (WSW) and lifetime sexual partner numbers, while unprotected penile-vaginal-sex was associated with BVAB2 detection by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Four of eight key BV-COs were significantly associated with BV after adjusting for the presence of other BV-COs. The majority of BV-COs were absent or rare in sexually-unexposed women, and associated with increasing sexual exposure, suggesting potential sexual transmission of BV-COs.
TI  - Altered vaginal microbiota are associated with perinatal mother-to-child transmission of HIV in African women from Burkina Faso.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV remains a significant problem in resource-limited settings, despite the advent of antiretroviral therapies. Because perturbations in vaginal microbial communities are associated with sexual transmission of HIV, we determined whether perinatal MTCT is associated with the vaginal microbiotas of HIV-infected mothers. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of cervicovaginal microbiotas by pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes (median 350 sequences per sample) from 10 transmitters and 54 nontransmitters during a perinatal MTCT prevention clinical trial of azidothymidine and the microbicide benzalkonium chloride. Logistic regression was performed adjusting for multiple covariates, including CD4(+) T-cell numbers and treatment group, to correlate abundances of microbial taxa with perinatal MTCT. RESULTS: The vaginal microbiotas of these subjects were dominated by several lactobacilli species, although a subset of subjects was colonized by diverse anaerobic species. MTCT of HIV was associated with significantly greater relative abundances of several groups of microorganisms. Most notably, among the abundant bacterial species, Gardnerella vaginalis was significantly enriched in cases of antepartum transmission, compared with nontransmission (odds ratio 1.7; P = 0.004). Neither azidothymidine nor benzalkonium chloride treatment was associated with shifts in microbial distributions compared with the placebo control group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that alterations in vaginal microbial communities are associated with an increased risk for perinatal MTCT, consistent with results with horizontal transmission of HIV. Therefore, determining the mucosal features associated with alterations in vaginal microbial communities may guide efforts to modulate the risk for HIV MTCT.
TI  - Detection of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  - To preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial DNA as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed PCR-based detection of 16S ribosomal RNA genes of Lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from DNA extracted from body fluids and stains. As a result, 16S ribosomal RNA genes of Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii and Atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. Bacterial genes detected in female urine might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. In addition, those of Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus gasseri and Gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. Because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in DNA samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, DNA samples prepared for the identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. In conclusion, 16S ribosomal RNA genes of L. crispatus, L. jensenii and A. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical diversity of Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from  women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is considered a substantial player in the progression of bacterial vaginosis (BV). We analysed 17 G. vaginalis strains isolated from the genital tract of women diagnosed with BV to establish a potential link between genotypes/biotypes and the expression of virulence factors, vaginolysin (VLY) and sialidase, which are assumed to play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of BV. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis revealed two G. vaginalis genotypes. Gardnerella vaginalis isolates of genotype 2 appeared more complex than genotype 1 and were subdivided into three subtypes. Biochemical typing allowed us to distinguish four different biotypes. A great diversity of the level of VLY production among the isolates of G. vaginalis may be related to a different cytotoxicity level of the strains. We did not find any correlation between VLY production level and G. vaginalis genotype/biotype. In contrast, a link between G. vaginalis genotype and sialidase production was established. Our findings on the diversity of VLY expression level in different clinical isolates and linking sialidase activity with the genotype of G. vaginalis could help to evaluate the pathogenic potential of different G. vaginalis strains.
TI  - The natural antimicrobial peptide subtilosin acts synergistically with glycerol monolaurate, lauric arginate, and epsilon-poly-L-lysine against bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens but not human lactobacilli.
AB  - Subtilosin is a cyclical antimicrobial peptide produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens that has antimicrobial activity against the bacterial vaginosis-associated human pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis. The ability of subtilosin to inhibit G. vaginalis alone and in combination with the natural antimicrobial agents glycerol monolaurate (Lauricidin), lauric arginate, and epsilon-poly-L-lysine was tested using a checkerboard approach. Subtilosin was found to act synergistically with all of the chosen antimicrobials. These promising results indicate that lower concentrations of subtilosin in combination with other compounds could effectively be used to inhibit growth of the pathogen, thereby decreasing the risk of developed antimicrobial resistance. This is the first report on the effects of subtilosin combined with other natural antimicrobials against G. vaginalis.
TI  - Evidence for Gardnerella vaginalis uptake and internalization by squamous vaginal epithelial cells: implications for the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common condition seen in premenopausal women, is associated with preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease, and delivery of low birth weight infants. Gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant bacterial species associated with BV, although its exact role in the pathology of BV is unknown. Using immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that VK2 vaginal epithelial cells take up G. vaginalis after exposure to the bacteria. Confocal microscopy also indicated the presence of internalized G. vaginalis within vaginal epithelial cells obtained from a subject with BV. Using VK2 cells and (35)S labeled bacteria in an invasion assay, we found that a 1 h uptake of G. vaginalis was 21.8-fold higher than heat-killed G. vaginalis, 84-fold compared to Lactobacillus acidophilus and 6.6-fold compared to Lactobacillus crispatus. Internalization was inhibited by pre-exposure of cells to cytochalasin-D. In addition, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was upregulated in VK2 cells exposed to G. vaginalis, but there was no change in actin cytoskeletal polymerization/rearrangements or vimentin subcellular relocalization post exposure. Cytoskeletal protein modifications could represent a potential mechanism for G. vaginalis mediated internalization by vaginal epithelial cells. Finally, understanding vaginal bacteria/host interactions will allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of BV pathogenesis.
TI  - Characterization of low molecular weight antimicrobial peptide from human female  reproductive tract.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The mechanisms that protect female upper genital tract from ascending infection by microbes present in vagina are only partially understood. It is expected that epithelial cells in mucosal surfaces and their secretions directly interfere with microbial colonization and invasion. This study was aimed to demonstrate the expression of 2 kDa antimicrobial peptide which was identified and purified from female genital tract tissues using chromatographic techniques. METHODS: Low molecular weight proteins were isolated from human female reproductive tract tissues obtained from premenopausal women. Antimicrobial activity of these LMW proteins was assessed against different reproductive tract pathogens viz., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Group B streptococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Escherechia coli and Candida albicans. The expression of these peptides were also documented in reproductive tract tissues with the help of hyperimmune sera raised against the rabbits. The purified peptide was characterized by N-terminal sequencing. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that 2 kDa peptide was expressed in the stratified squamous epithelial cells of the ectocervix while it was absent in columnar epithelial cells of upper genital tract. Upregulation of the expression of this peptide was observed in patients of chronic non-specific cervicitis and acute on chronic cervicitis. This purified antimicrobial peptide also showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against different reproductive tract pathogens. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Considering the emerging bacterial resistance against conventional antibiotics, isolation and understanding of the expression of antimicrobial peptides from female reproductive tissue extracts may provide some leads towards the development of strategies for the treatment of reproductive tract infections.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis in 2011: a lot of questions remain].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent vaginal affections. It results from a deep imbalance of the vaginal ecosystem whose mechanisms remain mysterious, even if recent progress were accomplished in their comprehension: if the flora implied in the bacterial vaginosis is recognized like polymorphic, it appears that Gardnerella vaginalis plays a major part with two genomically different forms: a commensal form (slightly adhesive to the epithelial cells), and a pathogenic one (strongly adhesive to the epithelial cells); the changes in lactobacilli are also to take into account: L. iners could be a marker of the vaginal flora imbalance whereas L. crispatus is generally met in the normal vaginal flora. These findings could influence the composition of coming probiotics; it is recognized that bacterial vaginosis is involved in the risk of prematurity but molecular quantification of G. vaginalis (and of Atopobium vaginae) is more sensitive for the diagnosis of BV what could improve the detection of high-risk pregnant women. The isolated antibiotic treatments are not very effective on the prevention of recurrences. The rebalancing of the vaginal flora is essential. In this field, the local estrogens showed some effectiveness. The use of probiotics is promising and can be recommended in complement of the antibiotic treatment even if the results of the clinical studies are still too heterogeneous to lead to precise indications.
TI  - [The role of infection in preterm birth].
AB  - Intrauterine infection could be responsible for 25% up to 40% of preterm births.  This relationship was initially demonstrated using animal models, inducing their abortion by injecting bacteria or endotoxins. In human research, examination of amniocentesis fluid showed the anteriority of infection over labor induction, and the existence of a subclinical latency phase between these two phenomena. The ascending route is preponderant, and four stages can be distinguished: cervical and vaginal infection, chorio-decidual infection, intra-amniotic infection, fetal infection. The intrauterine infection is very frequent in case of early preterm birth (<30 WG). It is associated with an increase of neurological and pulmonary morbidity. Most commonly found bacterial species are mycoplasma species, but also Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus B. Several markers of the infection have been studied: a maternal leukocytosis>15,000/mm(3) or a C-Reactive Protein (CRP)>20mg/l, an increase of fibronectin and/or IL-6 cervical, a short cervical length especially before 32 WG, a leukocytosis of the amniotic fluid, and/or high interleukin concentrations. The main marker used for the newborn is the CRP, but other markers can also be used for an early diagnosis of an infection, especially interleukin 6.
TI  - Production in yeast of pseudotype virus-like particles harboring functionally active antibody fragments neutralizing the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recombinant antibodies can be produced in different formats and different expression systems. Single chain variable fragments (scFvs) represent an attractive alternative to full-length antibodies and they can be easily produced in bacteria or yeast. However, the scFvs exhibit monovalent antigen-binding properties and short serum half-lives. The stability and avidity of the scFvs can be improved by their multimerization or fusion with IgG Fc domain. The aim of the current study was to investigate the possibilities to produce in yeast high-affinity scFv-Fc proteins neutralizing the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin (VLY), the main virulence factor of Gardnerella vaginalis. RESULTS: The scFv protein derived from hybridoma cell line producing high-affinity neutralizing antibodies against VLY was fused with human IgG1 Fc domain. Four different variants of anti-VLY scFv-Fc fusion proteins were constructed and produced in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The non-tagged scFv-Fc and hexahistidine-tagged scFv-Fc proteins were found predominantly as insoluble aggregates and therefore were not suitable for further purification and activity testing. The addition of yeast alpha-factor signal sequence did not support secretion of anti-VLY scFv-Fc but increased the amount of its intracellular soluble form. However, the purified protein showed a weak VLY-neutralizing capability. In contrast, the fusion of anti-VLY scFv-Fc molecules with hamster polyomavirus-derived VP2 protein and its co-expression with VP1 protein resulted in an effective production of pseudotype virus-like particles (VLPs) that exhibited strong VLY-binding activity. Recombinant scFv-Fc molecules displayed on the surface of VLPs neutralized VLY-mediated lysis of human erythrocytes and HeLa cells with high potency comparable to that of full-length antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant scFv-Fc proteins were expressed in yeast with low efficiency. New approach to display the scFv-Fc molecules on the surface of pseudotype VLPs was successful and allowed generation of multivalent scFv-Fc proteins with high VLY-neutralizing potency. Our study demonstrated for the first time that large recombinant antibody molecule fused with hamster polyomavirus VP2 protein and co-expressed with VP1 protein in the form of pseudotype VLPs was properly folded and exhibited strong antigen-binding activity. The current study broadens the potential of recombinant VLPs as a highly efficient carrier for functionally active complex proteins.
TI  - The microbiota of the vagina and its influence on women's health and disease.
AB  - Explorations of the vaginal microbiota (VMB) began over 150 years ago. Using light microscopy and bacterial cultures, the concept of normal versus abnormal microbiota in women began to emerge. The latter became known by the term "bacterial vaginosis" (BV). BV microbiota is dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis and includes a number of anaerobic organisms. In contrast, normal flora is dominated by various Lactobacilli. BV microbiota is associated with vaginal discharge, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, postoperative wound infections and endometritis after elective abortions. In addition, BV flora predisposes women to infection by human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted diseases. Application of molecular techniques over the past decade has significantly advanced our understanding of the VMB. It is far more complex than previously recognized and is composed of many previously unknown organisms in addition to those already identified by culture. Analyses using high-throughput sequencing techniques have revealed unique microbial communities not previously recognized within the older, established vaginal flora categories. These new findings will inform the design of future clinical investigations of the role of the VMB in health and disease.
TI  - Effect of sexual activity on vaginal colonization with hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis is associated with sexual activity, but mechanisms for this association are unclear. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of data from women reporting sex with women who provided information on sexual behaviors as part of a study of vaginal bacteria was conducted. Vaginal bacteria were detected by semiquantitative culture. Binomial regression with log-link evaluated associations between detection of bacteria and sexual behaviors reported to occur before enrollment. Linear regression evaluated associations between these behaviors and quantity of bacteria. RESULTS: Of the 320 women, 216 (68%) were colonized with H2O2-producing lactobacilli and 142 (44%) with Gardnerella vaginalis. Colonization with G. vaginalis was associated with >20 digital-vaginal sex acts (risk ratio, 2.01; 1.22, 3.29) or >10 toy-vaginal acts in the past 3 months (risk ratio, 1.76; 1.32, 2.36). Quantity of H2O2-producing lactobacilli was 1.3 log lower in colonized women reporting >10 acts of insertive vaginal sex-toy use in the past 3 months (95% confidence interval: -2.04, -0.56), 1.19 log lower with toy-vaginal sex in past 7 days (-1.75, -0.62), and 0.78 log lower in women sharing toys with a partner (-1.25, -0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Vaginal insertive use and sharing of sex toys were associated with decreased quantities of H2O2-producing lactobacilli and higher risk of colonization with G. vaginalis.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis, Atopobium vaginae and nifuratel.
AB  - As bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a potential cause of obstetric complications and gynecological disorders, there is substantial interest in establishing the most effective treatment. Standard treatment - metronidazole or clindamycin, by either vaginal or oral route is followed by relapses in about 30% of cases, within a month from treatment completion. This inability to prevent recurrences reflects our lack of knowledge on the origins of BV. Atopobium vaginae has been recently reported to be associated with BV in around 80% of the cases and might be involved in the therapeutic failures. This review looks at the potential benefits of nifuratel against A. vaginae compared to the standard treatments with metronidazole and clindamycin. In vitro, nifuratel is able to inhibit the growth of A. vaginae, with a MIC range of 0.125-1 mug/mL; it is active against G. vaginalis and does not affect lactobacilli. Metronidazole is active against A. vaginae only at very high concentrations (8-256 mug/mL); it is partially active against G. vaginalis and also has no effect on lactobacilli. Clindamycin acts against A. vaginae with an MIC lower than 0.125 mug/mL and is active on G. vaginalis but it also affects lactobacilli, altering the vaginal environment. These observations suggest that nifuratel is probably the most valid therapeutic agent for BV treatment.
TI  - Generation of recombinant single-chain antibodies neutralizing the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin, the main virulence factor of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gardnerella vaginalis is identified as the predominant colonist of the vaginal tract in women with bacterial vaginosis. Vaginolysin (VLY) is a protein toxin released by G. vaginalis. VLY possesses cytolytic activity and is considered as a main virulence factor of G. vaginalis. Inhibition of VLY-mediated cell lysis by antibodies may have important physiological relevance. RESULTS: Single-chain variable fragments of immunoglobulins (scFvs) were cloned from two hybridoma cell lines producing neutralizing antibodies against VLY and expressed as active proteins in E. coli. For each hybridoma, two variants of anti-VLY scFv consisting of either VL-VH or VH-VL linked with a 20 aa-long linker sequence (G(4)S)(4) were constructed. Recovery of scFvs from inclusion bodies with subsequent purification by metal-chelate chromatography resulted in VLY-binding proteins that were predominantly monomeric. The antigen-binding activity of purified scFvs was verified by an indirect ELISA. The neutralizing activity was investigated by in vitro hemolytic assay and cytolytic assay using HeLa cell line. Calculated apparent Kd values and neutralizing potency of scFvs were in agreement with those of parental full-length antibodies. VH-VL and VL-VH variants of scFvs showed similar affinity and neutralizing potency. The anti-VLY scFvs derived from hybridoma clone 9B4 exhibited high VLY-neutralizing activity both on human erythrocytes and cervical epithelial HeLa cells. CONCLUSIONS: Hybridoma-derived scFvs with VLY-binding activity were expressed in E. coli. Recombinant anti-VLY scFvs inhibited VLY-mediated cell lysis. The monovalent scFvs showed reduced affinity and neutralizing potency as compared to the respective full-length antibodies. The loss of avidity could be restored by generating scFv constructs with multivalent binding properties. Generated scFvs is the first example of recombinant single-chain antibodies with VLY-neutralizing activity produced in prokaryote expression system. G. vaginalis caused infections continue to be a world-wide problem, therefore neutralizing recombinant antibodies may provide novel therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and other diseases caused by G. vaginalis.
TI  - Exploring the diversity of Gardnerella vaginalis in the genitourinary tract microbiota of monogamous couples through subtle nucleotide variation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an enigmatic disease of unknown origin that affects a large percentage of women. The vaginal microbiota of women with BV is associated with serious sequelae, including abnormal pregnancies. The etiology of BV is not fully understood, however, it has been suggested that it is transmissible, and that G. vaginalis may be an etiological agent. Studies using enzymatic assays to define G. vaginalis biotypes, as well as more recent genomic comparisons of G. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic women, suggest that particular G. vaginalis strains may play a key role in the pathogenesis of BV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To explore G. vaginalis diversity, distribution and sexual transmission, we developed a Shannon entropy-based method to analyze low-level sequence variation in 65,710 G. vaginalis 16S rRNA gene segments that were PCR-amplified from vaginal samples of 53 monogamous women and from urethral and penile skin samples of their male partners. We observed a high degree of low-level diversity among G. vaginalis sequences with a total of 46 unique sequence variants (oligotypes), and also found strong correlations of these oligotypes between sexual partners. Even though Gram stain-defined normal and some Gram stain-defined intermediate oligotype profiles clustered together in UniFrac analysis, no single G. vaginalis oligotype was found to be specific to BV or normal vaginal samples. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a novel method for investigating G. vaginalis diversity at a low level of taxonomic discrimination. The findings support cultivation-based studies that indicate sexual partners harbor the same strains of G. vaginalis. This study also highlights the fact that a few, reproducible nucleotide variations within the 16S rRNA gene can reveal clinical or epidemiological associations that would be missed by genus-level or species-level categorization of 16S rRNA data.
TI  - Multiplex detection of bacteria in complex clinical and environmental samples using oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a recurring polymicrobial syndrome that is characterized by a change in the "normal" microbiota from Lactobacillus-dominated to a microbiota dominated by a number of bacterial species, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and others. This condition is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including HIV acquisition, and it can be difficult to manage clinically. Furthermore, diagnosis of BV has relied on the use of Gram stains of vaginal swab smears that are scored on various numerical criteria. While this diagnostic is simple, inexpensive, and well suited to resource-limited settings, it can suffer from problems related to subjective interpretations and it does not give a detailed profile of the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Recent deep sequencing efforts have revealed a rich, diverse vaginal microbiota with clear differences between samples taken from individuals that are diagnosed with BV compared to those individuals that are considered normal, which has resulted in the identification of a number of potential targets for molecular diagnosis of BV. These studies have provided a wealth of useful information, but deep sequencing is not yet practical as a diagnostic method in a clinical setting. We have recently described a method for rapidly profiling the vaginal microbiota in a multiplex format using oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads with detection on a Luminex platform. This method, like current Gram stain-based methods, is rapid and simple but adds the additional advantage of exploiting molecular knowledge arising from sequencing studies in probe design. This method therefore provides a way to profile the major microorganisms that are present in a vaginal swab that can be used to diagnose BV with high specificity and sensitivity compared to Gram stain while providing additional information on species presence and abundance in a semi-quantitative and rapid manner. This multiplex method is expandable well beyond the range of current quantitative PCR assays for particular organisms, which is currently limited to 5 or 6 different assays in a single sample. Importantly, the method is not limited to the detection of bacteria in vaginal swabs and can be easily adapted to rapidly profile nearly any microbial community of interest. For example, we have recently begun to apply this methodology to the development of diagnostic tools for use in wastewater treatment plants.
TI  - The species-specific mode of action of the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin against Listeria monocytogenes Scott A.
AB  - AIMS: To elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin against the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes Scott A. METHODS AND RESULTS: Subtilosin was purified from a culture of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The minimal inhibitory concentration of subtilosin against L. monocytogenes Scott A was determined by broth microdilution method. The effect of subtilosin on the transmembrane electrical potential (DeltaPsi) and pH gradient (DeltapH), and its ability to induce efflux of intracellular ATP, was investigated. Subtilosin fully inhibited L. monocytogenes growth at a concentration of 19 mug ml(-1) . Subtilosin caused a partial depletion of the DeltaPsi and had a similar minor effect on the DeltapH. There was no significant efflux of intracellular ATP. CONCLUSION: Subtilosin likely acts upon L. monocytogenes Scott A by perturbing the lipid bilayer of the cellular membrane and causing intracellular damage, leading to eventual cell death. Subtilosin's mode of action against L. monocytogenes Scott A differs from the one previously described for another human pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report on the specific mode of action of subtilosin against L. monocytogenes and the first report of a bacteriocin with a species-specific mode of action.
TI  - Characteristics of patients with subchorionic hematomas in the second trimester.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the etiological characteristics of  patients diagnosed with subchorionic hematoma. METHODS: A case-controlled study was performed to compare characteristics of patients and controls. Via ultrasound examination, 47 pregnant patients were found to have subchorionic hematomas and 1075 had no evidence of subchorionic hematomas (controls). In the second trimester, patients were compared with regard to endocervical Chlamydia trachomatis and other vaginal microorganisms. RESULTS: The overall incidence of subchorionic hematomas in this pregnant population was 4.2%. Maternal clinical characteristics did not differ between cases and controls. Evaluation of the vaginal flora revealed that the positive rates of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cases: 12.8%; controls: 4.1%; P<0.01) and Gardnerella vaginalis (cases: 12.8%; controls: 2.5%; P<0.001) in the cases were significantly higher than those of the controls. The negative rate of Lactobacillus in the cases was significantly higher than that of the controls (cases: 42.6%; controls: 27.6%; P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women with subchorionic hematoma in the first trimester showed changes in vaginal flora in the second trimester, which suggests a possible association with subchorionic hematoma and vaginal flora change.
TI  - Effects of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria and sexual intercourse on vaginal colonization with the probiotic Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several fastidious bacteria have been associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), but their role in lactobacilli recolonization failure is unknown. We studied the effect of 7 BV-associated bacterial species and 2 Lactobacillus species on vaginal colonization with Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05 (LACTIN-V). METHODS: Twenty-four women with BV were given a 5-day course of metronidazole vaginal gel and then randomized 3:1 to receive either LACTIN-V or placebo applied vaginally once daily for 5 initial consecutive days, followed by a weekly application over 2 weeks. Vaginal swabs for L. crispatus CTV-05 culture and 9 bacterium-specific 16S rRNA gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were analyzed on several study visits for the 18 women receiving LACTIN-V. RESULTS: Vaginal colonization with CTV-05 was achieved in 61% of the participants receiving LACTIN-V at either day 10 or day 28 visit and 44% at day 28. Participants not colonized with CTV-05 had generally higher median concentrations of BV-associated bacteria compared to those who colonized. Between enrollment and day 28, the median concentration of Gardnerella vaginalis minimally reduced from 10 to 10 16S rRNA gene copies per swab in women who colonized with CTV-05 but increased from 10 to 10 in those who failed to colonize (P = 0.19). Similarly, the median concentration of Atopobium spp. reduced from 10 16S rRNA gene copies per swab to below limit of detection in women who colonized with CTV-05, but increased from 10 to 10 in those who failed to colonize (P = 0.04). The presence of endogenous L. crispatus at enrollment was found to be significantly associated with a reduced odds of colonization with CTV-05 on day 28 (P = 0.003), and vaginal intercourse during the study significantly impaired successful CTV-05 colonization (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Vaginal concentration of certain BV-associated bacteria, vaginal intercourse during treatment, and the presence of endogenous L. crispatus at enrollment predict colonization with probiotic lactobacilli.
TI  - [Evaluation of efficacy of ketoconazole 800 mg-clindamycin 100 mg tablets vaginal against ketoconazole 800 mg- clindamycin 100 mg vaginal capsules in candida vaginitis and vaginosis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: pharmaceutical forms (presentations) influence treatment compliance and therefore the effectiveness. Here we present the results in the relief of vaginitis and vaginosis with two different dosage forms. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of ketoconazole 800 mg + clindamycin in soft vaginal gel capsules 100 mg (vaginal capsules) against ketoconazole 800 mg + 100 mg clindamycin vaginal tablets (TV) in the management of vaginitis by C. albicans and/or vaginosis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In a randomized, multicenter, comparative open label study, patients between 18 and 60 years with a diagnosis of vaginitis by C. albicans and/or vaginosis were included. Patients were evaluated clinically and direct exam of genital discharge and culture were performed. Patients were randomized to one of two treatments vaginal tablets or vaginal capsules, for 3 days. RESULTS: one hundred an sitxty nine patients were included, 85 in TV Group and 84 in vaginal capsules group. We found significant statistical difference in clinical response for tablet group at day three for burning p = 0.032 and itching p = 0.043. Microbiological cure was observed in patients with vaginitis by C. albicans, 92.5% in Group TV vs. 90.47% vaginal capsules group, all patients with G. vaginalis at baseline were negative for the organism at the end of the study, cure in patients with mixed infections were 78.94% for TV group vs. 78.26% vaginal capsules; group no adverse events were reported during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of vaginitis/vaginosis with vaginal tablets is clinically better than vaginal soft gelatin capsules both treatments were well tolerated.
TI  - The complex vaginal flora of West African women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The spectrum of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) has recently expanded through taxonomic changes and the use of molecular methods. These methods have yet to be used in large-scale epidemiological studies in Africa where BV is highly prevalent. METHODS: An analysis of samples obtained during a clinical trial of the management of vaginal discharge in four West African countries. Samples were available from 1555 participants; 843 (54%) had BV. Nucleic acids of 13 bacterial genera or species potentially associated with BV were detected through the polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The associations between various components of the vaginal flora were complex. Excluding Lactobacillus, the other 12 micro-organisms were all associated with each other at the p</=0.001 level. The prevalence of various bacterial genera or species varied according to age, sexual activity and HIV status. In multivariate analysis, the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bifidobacterium, Megasphaera elsdenii, Dialister, Mycoplasma hominis, Leptotrichia, and Prevotella were independently associated with BV as was the absence of Lactobacillus and Peptoniphilus. However, Mobiluncus, Atopobium vaginae, Anaerococcus, and Eggerthella were not independently associated with BV. Unexpectedly, after treatment with a regimen that included either metronidazole or tinidazole, the proportion of patients with a complete resolution of symptoms by day 14 increased with the number of bacterial genera or species present at enrolment. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous bacterial genera or species were strongly associated with each other in a pattern that suggested a symbiotic relationship. BV cases with a simpler flora were less likely to respond to treatment. Overall, the vaginal flora of West African women with BV was reminiscent of that of their counterparts in industrialized countries.
TI  - Elucidation of the Molecular Mechanisms of Action of the Natural Antimicrobial Peptide Subtilosin Against the Bacterial Vaginosis-associated Pathogen Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Subtilosin A is a 35-amino acid long cyclical peptide produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens that has potent antimicrobial activity against a variety of human pathogens, including the bacterial vaginosis-related Gardnerella vaginalis. The specific mode of action of subtilosin against G. vaginalis was elucidated by studying its effects on the proton motive force's (PMF) components: transmembrane electric potential (DeltaPsi), transmembrane pH gradient (DeltapH), and intracellular ATP levels. The addition of subtilosin to G. vaginalis cells caused an immediate and total depletion of the DeltapH, but had no effect on the DeltaPsi. Subtilosin also triggered an instant but partial efflux of intracellular ATP that was twofold higher than that of the positive control bacteriocin, nisin. Taken together, these data suggest that subtilosin inhibits G. vaginalis growth by creating transient pores in the cells' cytoplasmic membrane, leading to an efflux of intracellular ions and ATP and eventually cell death.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: what is physiological in vaginal bacteriology? An update and opinion.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was originally described as a sexually transmitted infection caused by a single microbe. The prevailing concept describes BV as a polymicrobial coitus-associated disease of uncertain origin. In this overview the natural history of BV as a monobacterial and polymicrobial entity is examined with respect to the physiological concept of BV in relation to sexual behavior before and after introduction of the hormonal contraceptive pill. Bacterial vaginosis, characterized by low vaginal acidity (elevated pH) and replacement of vaginal Lactobacillus by Gardnerella vaginalis flora, could be caused by unprotected intercourse when a low pH changes through the neutralizing power of male ejaculate, vaginal coital transudate and vaginal neurogenic transudate. A monobacterial form, G. vaginalis vaginitis, could be a physiological post-coital condition for protection of ejaculated spermatozoa, characterized by 'pure'Gardnerella flora and elevated pH as an immediate result of an incidental unprotected coital act through neutralization of vaginal acid and replacement of Lactobacillus by Gardnerella flora. A polymicrobial form of BV could be autoinfection of the post-coital physiological G. vaginalis flora, characterized by a mixture of G. vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis and anaerobic bacteria at lower vaginal acidity, possibly resulting from suppression of normal vaginal acidity through repeated sexual acts, with a resultant higher pH and transfer of enteric bacteria from the perianal region. Monobacterial and polymicrobial auto-infectious forms of BV may be clinically distinct and share a common origin. The understanding of BV as a basic physiological entity could influence the prophylaxis and treatment of the largely therapy-resistant polymicrobial BV.
TI  - [Short - term combined 5-nitroimidazole treatment in vaginal dysbacteriosis with  dominant anaerobic species].
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of short-term, combined 5-nitroimidazole treatment in vaginal dysbacteriosis with dominant anaerobic species. The presence of infection was proven by microscopic examination of vaginal fluid (Nugent, modified by Ison-Hay-Keane scale), microbiological culture, and by clinical symptoms (Amsel). 179 patients were included in our study. Clinical and microbiological examinations were performed prior to the treatment and at the end of the study (day 8 after the first dose of short- term combined 5-nitroimidazole treatment). The treatment included applications of 1 g BID tinidazole for two days and vaginal suppositories of 1000mg metronidazol at day 1 and 3. Based on the microbiological tests prior to the treatment Gardnerella vaginalis alone was present in 132 patients (73.7%). The rest of the patients, 47 or 26.3% of the treatment group, the infection was present by mixture of several anaerobic species. At the end of the treatment 83.2% of the treated population showed no clinical symptoms of dysbacteriosis, and 73.7% of the treated patients showed no dysbacteriosis in microbiological test results. Based on the results mentioned above it was determined that the short-term combined 5-nitroimidazole therapy was effective in treatment of vaginal dysbacteriosis with dominant anaerobic species.
TI  - Diagnosis of vaginal discharge by wet mount microscopy: a simple and underrated method.
AB  - Vaginal discharge is highly variable in quality and quantity among different individuals, and even in the same individual during different periods of life. Vaginal discharge is most commonly caused by infection with sexually transmitted organisms or increased colonization by different facultative pathogenic microorganisms (i.e., Gardnerella vaginalis). Noninfectious causes of vaginal discharge are quite rare (10% noninfectious as compared to 90% infectious causes). Most common in women with a vaginal infection is bacterial vaginosis (40%-50% of cases), followed by vulvovaginal candidosis (20%-25%), and then trichomoniasis (15%-20%). If infection is suspected as the primary cause, a sample of the vaginal discharge should be taken and examined microscopically. When evaluating vaginal secretions by phase-contrast wet mount microscopy, knowledge of what is normal versus abnormal is very important. Knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of wet mount microscopy in different clinical settings is also important. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to evaluate lifetime changes in vaginal secretions, characterize the physiological and pathological appearance of vaginal discharge, assess the clinical practicality and usefulness of wet mount microscopy and use wet mount microscopy to diagnose bacterial vaginosis and other common vaginal infections.
TI  - Artemisia princeps Pamp. Essential oil and its constituents eucalyptol and alpha-terpineol ameliorate bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis in mice by inhibiting bacterial growth and NF-kappaB activation.
AB  - To investigate the inhibitory effects of Artemisia princeps Pamp. (family Asteraceae) essential oil (APEO) and its main constituents against bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis, their antimicrobial activities against Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans in vitro and their anti-inflammatory effects against G. vaginalis-induced vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis were examined in mice. APEO and its constituents eucalyptol and alpha-terpineol were found to inhibit microbe growths. alpha-Terpineol most potently inhibited the growths of G. vaginalis and C. albicans with MIC values of 0.06 and 0.125 % (v/v), respectively. The antimicrobial activity of alpha-terpineol was found to be comparable to that of clotrimazole. Intravaginal treatment with APEO, eucalyptol, or alpha-terpineol significantly decreased viable G. vaginalis and C. albicans numbers in the vaginal cavity and myeloperoxidase activity in mouse vaginal tissues compared with controls. These agents also inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF- alpha), COX-2, iNOS, and the activation of NF- kappaB and increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In addition, they inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of NF- kappaB in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, and alpha-terpineol most potently inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and NF- kappaB activation. Based on these findings, APEO and its constituents, particularly alpha-terpineol, ameliorate bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis by inhibiting the growths of vaginal pathogens and the activation of NF- kappaB.
TI  - The genital econiche: focus on microbiota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Ecological and evolutionary forces shaping the normal and abnormal microflora of  the genital econiche are discussed, in particular those related to bacterial vaginosis, which worldwide is the most common vaginal infection, with numerous obstetrical and gynecological complications, including acquisition and transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Characterized by a heavy overgrowth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobes with no signs of inflammation, bacterial vaginosis has been regarded a microbiological and immunological enigma. Immune tolerance to both normal and abnormal vaginal microbiota, mainly derived from gut microflora, as a result of coevolution with humans might explain the absence of inflammation, supported by short-chain fatty acids, known to modulate immune responses, that are produced in large quantities by anaerobes. Recent studies have implicated the development of a vaginal biofilm with Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae as main players in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. Supporting this conclusion are data such as those demonstrating heavy growth of G. vaginalis and diversified anaerobes with numerous "clue cells" that are sloughing off from the biofilm. Gardnerella and Atopobium organisms attached to these clue cells can be demonstrated in the male genital econiche, likely reflecting a heterosexual transmission of the disorder.
TI  - Lactobacillus johnsonii HY7042 ameliorates Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis by killing Gardnerella vaginalis and inhibiting NF-kappaB activation.
AB  - Hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from women's vaginas and their anti-inflammatory effects against Gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis were examined in beta-estradiol-immunosuppressed mice. Oral and intravaginal treatment with five LABs significantly decreased viable G. vaginalis numbers in vaginal cavities and myeloperoxidase activity in mouse vaginal tissues. Of the LABs examined, Lactobacillus johnsonii HY7042 (LJ) most potently inhibited G. vaginalis-induced vaginosis. This LAB also inhibited the expressions of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, COX-2, and iNOS, and the activation of NF-kappaB in vaginal tissues, but increased IL-10 expression. Orally administered LJ (0.2x10(8) CFU/mouse) also inhibited the expression of TNF-alpha by 91.7% in beta-estradiol-immunosuppressed mice intraperitoneally injected with LPS. However, it increased IL-10 expression by 63.3% in these mice. Furthermore, LJ inhibited the expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, and the activation of NF-kappaB in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. LJ also killed G. vaginalis attached with and without HeLa cells. These findings suggest that LJ inhibits bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting the expressions of COX-2, iNOS, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha by regulating NF-kappaB activation and by killing G. vaginalis, and that LJ could ameliorate bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Self-collected vaginal swabs for the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis and the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using self-collected vaginal specimens for the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays of bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria versus practitioner-collected swabs. A cross-sectional study included 190 pregnant women enrolled before 20 weeks' gestation from September 2008 to November 2009. Self- and practitioner-collected swabs were taken during the same prenatal visit for each woman, qPCR assays performed for each, and the results compared. The quantification of the human albumin gene was used as an internal control to ensure sampling quality and accurate comparisons. The level of agreement of the qPCR assays for each microorganism was calculated with the Spearman product moment correlation coefficient and the kappa statistic. In all, 370 vaginal samples (185 self- and 185 practitioner-collected swabs) had a narrow range of values for the number of albumin gene copies and a significant correlation coefficient (Spearman's rho = 0.532; p < 0.001). The agreement between both sampling methods was excellent (Spearman's rho was 0.748 for Atopobium vaginae, 0.918 for Lactobacillus species, 0.940 for Gardnerella vaginalis; p < 0.001), especially for high concentrations of A. vaginae (>/=10(8) copies/mL; kappa value = 0.973; p < 0.001) and G. vaginalis (>/=10(9) copies/mL; kappa value = 0.903; p < 0.001). This study demonstrates the validity and reliability of self- versus practitioner-collected swabs for the molecular quantification of Lactobacillus species, G. vaginalis, and A. vaginae.
TI  - Intravaginal microbial flora by the 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Conventional diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis contains some controversial points. To understand accurately the relationship between clinical stages and the microbiotas, the intravaginal microbial flora was analyzed by the clone library method. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal fluid samples from 31 patients were examined. Lactobacillary grade, Nugent score, culture-based method, and clone library analysis using the 16SrRNA gene sequencing were performed and were compared with each other. RESULTS: Patients were categorized by Lactobacillary grade as I (normal) (n = 6), II (intermediate) (n = 11), and III (bacterial vaginosis) (n = 14). The clone library analysis detected 36 bacterial genera and 60 species from all 31 samples. A principal component analysis of the microbial proportions revealed a novel classification, which suggested the significance of the relative ratio of Lactobacillus iners, Atopobium vaginae and anaerobes in bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSION: Clone library analysis in combination with the conventional method provides substantial information for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Zinc Lactate and Sapindin Act Synergistically with Lactocin 160 Against Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Lactocin 160 is a vaginal probiotic-derived bacteriocin shown to selectively inhibit the growth of Gardenerella vaginalis and some other pathogens commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis. The natural origin of this peptide, its safety, and selective antimicrobial properties make it a promising candidate for successful treatment and prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis (BV). This study evaluated interactions between lactocin 160 and four other natural antimicrobials in the ability to inhibit G. vaginalis. We report that zinc lactate and soapnut extract act synergistically with lactocin 160 against this pathogen and therefore have a potential to be successfully used as the components of the multiple-hurdle antimicrobial formulation for the treatment of BV.
TI  - In vitro secretion profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and of human beta-defensins (HBD)-1, HBD-2, and HBD-3 from human chorioamniotic membranes after selective stimulation with Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - PROBLEM: Preterm labor associated with infection is a major clinical condition; in this work, we analyze the response of human chorioamniotic membranes stimulated with Gardnerella vaginalis. METHOD OF STUDY: Using a two-compartment experimental model, 1 x 10(6) CFU/mL of G. vaginalis were added to either the amnion or choriodecidua face or to both. Concentrations of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, as well as human beta defensins (HBD) 1-3 were quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: In comparison with control conditions and regardless of the stimulation modality, IL-1beta and IL-6 increased 4-fold and 28-fold, respectively, in the choriodecidual compartment. HBD-1 increased 2-fold mainly in the amniotic compartment when the stimulus was applied directly to this region. HBD-2 and HBD-3 increased an average of 2- and 8-fold, respectively, in the choriodecidual region. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation with G. vaginalis induced a tissue-specific secretion profile of 1L-1beta, IL-6, and HBD 1-3 in the chorioamniotic membranes.
TI  - Organism diversity between women with and without bacterial vaginosis as determined by polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA gene sequence.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to characterize the different structures of microbial communities between 20 healthy women and 17 bacterial vaginosis (BV)-positive women of reproductive age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vaginal samples from 17 BV-positive and 20 BV-negative women were subjected to DNA extraction, and amplified with eubacterial 16S rRNA gene-specific primers via polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction products were separated using DGGE. Bands were excised, re-amplified, purified and sequenced. DNA sequences were compared with GenBank database. Phylip software packages were used to calculate sequencing data and form a phylogenetic tree to identify the genetic relations for microbiota inhabited in vaginal ecosystems of BV-positive women. RESULTS: In total, 28 kinds of organisms were detected that comprised BV(+) vagina microbial community, varying from three to nine kinds with an average of 5.71 kinds per woman. Only seven species were detected in BV(-) women, ranging between one and five species with an average of 2.40 species per woman, which was significantly lower than that detected in BV(+) women (t = 7.39, P < 0.001). A strain of Uncultured Lactobacillus sp. clone EHFS1_S05c (29/37; 78.38%) was most commonly presented in both BV-negative and BV-positive women, but the mean proportion of this Lactobacillus sp. strain to the whole microbial population colonized in the vaginal tract of BV(-) women was sharply higher than that calculated from BV(+) women (t = 2.92, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate further diversity in the category of vaginal microorganisms associated with BV. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis is not necessary as a sign for gynecologists to determine whether or not a woman is affected by BV.
TI  - Biotypes and virulence factors of Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from cases of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The present study was conducted to correlate the biotypes of Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from cases of bacterial vaginosis and their virulence factors. Thirty-two strains of G. vaginalis isolated from cases of bacterial vaginosis were biotyped. Adherence to vaginal epithelial cells, biofilm production, surface hydrophobicity, phospholipase C and protease activity were tested on these isolates. Biotype 1 was the most prevalent (8; 25%), followed by biotype 2 (7; 21.9%) and biotypes 5 and 8 (5; 15.6%). We did not find any statistical correlation between G. vaginalis biotypes and its virulence factors. Virulence factors expressed by G. vaginalis were not associated with a single biotype.
TI  - Male urethral Pap smears and peniscopy examination and polymerase chain reaction  human papillomavirus correlation.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine HPV in a male population and its correlation with penile gross inspection and urethral pap smears. Fifty male volunteers were included in the study; all of them were sexual partners of women with evidence of HPV-related cervical diseases. Urethral Pap smear features and polymerase chain reaction (PCR; HPV detection) of urethral samples were correlated. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify variables associated with high and low-risk HPV types. Mean age of participants was 33.14 +/- 1.52 (range, 23-50 years), and the mean age for those with high risk HPV was 32.12 +/- 6.66 and 34.08 +/- 6.58 for subjects with low-risk HPV (P = 0.820). Penile gross inspection revealed 19 (38%) cases with no lesions, papules in balanoprepusial furrol/sulcus in 23 (46%) cases, papilla in 23 (46%) cases, urethral lesions in 22 (44%) cases, penile body plaques in 22 (44%) cases, melanoses in 11 (22%) cases, sebaceous cysts on scrotum in 10 (20%) cases, and molting of the glands in 28 (56%) cases. Cytopathologic analysis revealed koilocytes in 24 (48%) cases. Dyskeratosis was observed in 24 (48%) cases. A bacterial background was found in 27 (54%) cases, and inflammatory cells were found in 27 (54%) cases. Twenty-six (52%) cases showed cytological features suggestive of Gardnerella Vaginalis. Twenty-four (48%) cases were high-risk HPV, and 26 (52%) were low-risk HPV (P = 0.037) as assessed by PCR-based detection. There was a statistically significant difference between koilocytes and bacterial background with high-risk human papillomavirus (P = 0.001). Abnormal colposcopy examination detected lesions were sampled for cytology by Pap smears.
TI  - Strong correspondence in bacterial loads between the vagina and rectum of pregnant women.
AB  - We sampled the vagina and rectum in 71 pregnant women and bacterial loads of Lactobacillus crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. iners, Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae were determined by culture and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Culture and qPCR results differed substantially with regard to the evaluation of vaginal and rectal occurrence of the six species tested. The vaginal-rectal prevalence of L. crispatus, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, L. iners, G. vaginalis and A. vaginae as established by culture vs. PCR was 32.3 vs. 91.5%, 32.3 vs. 77.4%, 28.1 vs. 91.5%, 12.6 vs. 68.5%, 12.6 vs. 74.6% and 5.6 vs. 69.0%, respectively. Using qPCR, a significant positive correlation was found between vaginal and rectal loads of L. crispatus (p < 0.0001), L. jensenii (p < 0.0001), L. gasseri (p = 0.005), L. iners (p = 0.003) and A. vaginae (p = 0.002). In summary, significant correlations between quantities of vaginal and rectal lactobacilli and of Atopobium vaginae were established by means of qPCR, indicating strong correspondence of vaginal and rectal microflora, not only in the occurrence of certain species in both niches, but also of cell densities per bacterial species.
TI  - Disruption of urogenital biofilms by lactobacilli.
AB  - The process that changes a relatively sparse vaginal microbiota of healthy women  into a dense biofilm of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria is poorly understood. Likewise, the reverse step whereby an aberrant biofilm is displaced and returns to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota is unclear. In order to study these phenomena, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the structure of biofilms associated with aerobic vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and bacterial vaginosis (BV). Uropathogenic Escherichia coli were able to form relatively thin biofilms within five days (6 mum height), while Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis formed thicker biofilms 12 mum in height within two days. Challenge of E. coli biofilms with lactobacilli did not result in pathogen displacement. However, the resulting thicker lactobacilli infused biofilms, caused significant E. coli killing. E. coli biofilms challenged with secreted products of L. rhamnosus GR-1 caused a marked decrease in cell density, and increased cell death. Similarly challenge of BV biofilms with lactobacilli infiltrated BV biofilms and caused bacterial cell death. Metronidazole produced holes in the biofilm but did not eradicate the organisms. The findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an aberrant vaginal microbiota, and strengthen the position that combining probiotics with antimicrobials could better eradicate pathogenic biofilms.
TI  - [Effect of combined therapy using complex of natural cytokines and antimicrobial  peptides in urogenital infections caused by Chlamydia and Mycoplasma].
AB  - AIM: To study efficacy of complex therapy of urogenital infections caused by Chlamydia and Mycoplasma using immunomodulator Superlimph. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty males and thirty six females ages 22 - 47 years old with chronic urogenital infections--cervicitis and vulvovaginitis (females), prostatitis (males)--were studied. PCR and bacteriologic methods were used for diagnostics of mixed infection and microbiota efficiency. Patients were divided on 3 groups according to treatment protocol. Twenty patients (group 1)--standard therapy (josamycin), 48 patients received immunomodulator (suppositorium) before treatment with josamycin (group 2), 18 patients were simultaneously treated with josamycin and immunomodulator (group 3). RESULTS: Combinations of Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma genitalium were identified in 30 - 35% of cases before treatment. After treatment with josamycin (group 1) or simultaneous therapy with josamycin and immunomodulator (group 3) considerable suppression of growth and elimination of both main pathogens and members of microbiota. Use of immunomodulator (group 2) in some cases resulted elimination of main pathogens and associated opportunistic microflora. CONCLUSION: Microbiological monitoring in 97% cases demonstrated therapeutic effect of immunomodulator Superlymph on urogenital infections associated with Chlamydia and Mycoplasma and disbiotic microbiota of urogenital tract.
TI  - HIV-infected women of Burkina Faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 HIV-positive compared to 200 HIV-negative women at the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) service of Saint Camille Medical Center Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). METHODOLOGY: After revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. RESULTS: Among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, we identified respectively: Mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus 5.5%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection M. hominis with U. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); Candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); E. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. The Nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of BV, was significantly higher in HIV-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxitocica, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence ranging from 0% to 5%. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the HIV-positive women of Burkina Faso are frequently affected by BV and represent a reservoir for mycoplasma infection. Since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis comprises three distinct genotypes of which only two produce sialidase.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sialidase and the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis have been proposed as biomarkers for bacterial vaginosis. Sialidase has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. We genotyped G vaginalis isolates, assessed the presence and diversity of sialidase-encoding genes, and determined the production of sialidase. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred thirty-four G vaginalis isolates were genotyped by random amplified polymorphic deoxyribonucleic acid (RAPD) and a selection of 29 isolates with amplified ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid restriction analysis (ARDRA). A G vaginalis sialidase quantitative polymerase chain reaction was developed, and the sialidase production was assessed with the filter spot test. RESULTS: Three G vaginalis genotypes could be distinguished by both RAPD and ARDRA. Only 2 genotypes encoded and produced sialidase. CONCLUSION: Three genotypes exist among G vaginalis isolates, and there is a clear link between genotype and sialidase production. A possible link between sialidase production and (symptomatic) bacterial vaginosis and biofilm production can be hypothesized.
TI  - The prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex PCR-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in Sydney, Australia.
AB  - This study used a previously described multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. First-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in Sydney, Australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. One hundred and sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly G. vaginalis and Ureaplasma spp. The prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. Of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. Only G. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (P = 0.05). The specificity of the mPCR/RLB assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. The mean sensitivities of the mPCR/RLB assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. There were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis and H. influenzae, although all were found infrequently. Overall, the mPCR/RLB platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.
TI  - Damage to oviduct organ cultures by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is a Gram-variable coccobacillus found in the lower genital tract, particularly of women. Very large numbers are found in the vagina in bacterial vaginosis. The pathogenicity of G. vaginalis was studied using fallopian tubes and bovine oviducts in organ culture. Whole organisms, whether piliated or not, from broth cultures caused the cilia on ciliated cells in the mucosa of either human or bovine oviducts to stop beating within 3 days or less. Cilia on control tissues kept beating for at least 5 days. Organism-free filtrates from broth cultures, whether frozen and thawed or heat-treated, caused the same effect, indicating the existence of a soluble toxin. Histological sections revealed little damage, but scanning electron microscopy showed damage to the mucosal surface with some loss of ciliated cells. The toxin is not human tissue specific and, therefore, unlikely to be the same as the cytotoxin with haemolytic properties described by others. The toxin could play a part in the development of salpingitis if G. vaginalis organisms gained access to the upper tract in large numbers.
TI  - Vaginal flora changes on Pap smears after insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) combines a uterine foreign body and the continuous release of low-dose levonorgestrel for contraception. Its influence on the rate of vulvovaginal infections and flora disturbance is insufficiently known, but important for contraceptive advice in women, especially those who develop recurrent vaginosis or Candida vulvovaginitis. STUDY DESIGN: Slides of 286 women who had a Pap smear taken before and 1 to 2 years after placement of a LNG-IUS were blindly reviewed for the presence of abnormal vaginal flora (AVF), bacterial vaginosis (BV), aerobic vaginitis (AV) and Candida vaginitis (CV). RESULTS: Prior to insertion, there were no differences in vaginal flora abnormalities between women using different kinds of contraception. LNG-IUS users did not have different rates of AVF, BV, AV or CV, but the general risk to develop any infection was increased. Uterine bleeding after insertion did not seem to predict a different flora type. CONCLUSION: We found that Pap smears suggested more vaginal infections after 1 year of LNG-IUS use than prior to insertion of the device.
TI  - Comparison of Affirm VPIII and Papanicolaou tests in the detection of infectious  vaginitis.
AB  - To compare the Affirm VPIII molecular test (Becton Dickinson, Burlington, NC) with morphologic identification used in routine Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening in the detection and identification of Candida species, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis, we identified 431 cases with a concomitant Pap test and Affirm VPIII assay performed from the archives of a large academic institution. The study population consisted of women ranging in age from 17 to 79 years (mean and median ages, 33 and 31 years, respectively). With a routine Pap test, 60 patients (13.9%) were found to have bacterial vaginosis, 60 (13.9%) candidiasis, and 3 (0.7%) Trichomonas infection. With the Affirm VPIII assay, 183 (42.5%) patients tested positive for G vaginalis, 70 (16.2%) positive for Candida species, and 10 (2.3%) positive for T vaginalis. The differences were statistically significant. The results demonstrate that our patient population had a high incidence of bacterial vaginosis/Candida vaginitis; however, the Affirm VPIII was a more sensitive diagnostic test for the detection and identification of all 3 organisms compared with the Pap test.
TI  - The aetiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection among women of childbearing age. This condition is notorious for causing severe complications related to the reproductive health of women. Five decades of intense research established many risk factors for acquisition of BV; however, because of the complexity of BV and lack of a reliable animal model for this condition, its exact aetiology remains elusive. In this manuscript, we use a historical perspective to critically review the development of major theories on the aetiology of BV, ultimately implicating BV-related pathogens, healthy vaginal microbiota, bacteriophages and the immune response of the host. None of these theories on their own can reliably explain the epidemiological data. Instead, BV is caused by a complex interaction of multiple factors, which include the numerous components of the vaginal microbial ecosystem and their human host. Many of these factors are yet to be characterized because a clear understanding of their relative contribution to the aetiology of BV is pivotal to the formulation of an effective treatment for and prophylaxis of this condition.
TI  - In vitro activity of nifuratel on vaginal bacteria: could it be a good candidate  for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis?
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a shift of the physiological flora to a diverse spectrum of bacteria, where Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae are the most important markers. In this study, the antimicrobial activity of nifuratel against G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and lactobacilli was compared with that of the two currently used antibiotics metronidazole and clindamycin. Results suggest that nifuratel has a better spectrum of activity, being highly active against G. vaginalis and A. vaginae without affecting lactobacilli.
TI  - Subtle perturbations of genital microflora alter mucosal immunity among low-risk  pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alteration in the vaginal flora has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of changes in individual microflora on genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women in early pregnancy. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Large, tertiary care, academic hospital clinic. POPULATION: Low-risk women were enrolled prior to 14 weeks' gestation. METHODS: Women were included if they had no medical or previous obstetrical complications, were non-smokers, had no sexually transmitted infections and no intercourse in the last 48 hours. Consenting women underwent speculum examination for collection of vaginal culture and Dacron swabs for cytokine analysis. Semi-quantitative vaginal cultures were performed in a reference laboratory. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Concentrations of immune mediators were compared in the presence of various organisms. Concentrations were converted to multiples of the median to standardize the values of each mediator. Regression analyses were performed to control for race. RESULTS: We enrolled 47 women. The frequencies of genital microorganisms were: H(2)O(2) -producing lactobacilli (70%), Ureaplasma urealyticum (66%), Gardnerella vaginalis (45%), anaerobic non-pigmented Gram-negative rods (ANPGNR, 40%), anaerobic pigmented Gram-negative rods (APGNR, 17%). After adjusting for race and body mass index, interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor were increased in the presence of G. vaginalis, ANPGNR, and APGNR. There was no consistent impact on the other markers of immune activation. CONCLUSION: The presence of individual species impacts genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women. Perturbations in genital immunity could partially explain heterogeneity in adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - Influence of menstruation on the microbiota of healthy women's labia minora as analyzed using a 16S rRNA gene-based clone library method.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the influence of menstruation on the bacterial population of healthy Japanese women's vulvas, especially the labia minora. Labia minora swabs were obtained from 10 premenopausal, nonpregnant Japanese women at premenstruation and on day 2 of menstruation. Vaginal swabs were also obtained from 3 out of the 10 women. No significant difference was found in the average bacterial cell count between the menstruation and premenstruation samples. Molecular analysis using a 16S rRNA gene-based clone library method detected 22 genera from the labia minora swabs (total 20), with the genus Lactobacillus being predominant at both premenstruation and during menstruation in 7 out of the 10 women. Of the other 3 women, 2 showed various kinds of bacterial species, including oral and fecal bacteria, with Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis predominating in the remaining woman's vulva in both conditions. In total, 6 out of 10 cases (60%) showed significantly different microbiota of the labia minora between the two conditions. These results imply that menstruation may promote a distortion of the bacterial flora around the vulva, although it causes no significant increase of the bacterial count.
TI  - Prevalence of genital Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Gardnerella, and human papillomavirus in Japanese men with urethritis, and risk factors for detection of urethral human papillomavirus infection.
AB  - To analyze the risk factors for HPV infection in the urethra, we examined the prevalence of various microorganisms, for example Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Ureaplasma parvum, Gardnerella vaginalis, and human papillomavirus (HPV) in Japanese male patients with urethritis, and investigated their sexual backgrounds. Rubbed samples obtained from the distal urethra and questionnaires regarding sexual activity and demographic information were collected from 176 participants. N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, U. parvum, G. vaginalis, and HPV were detected in 19, 26, 18, 12, 12, 8.5, 14, and 20%, respectively, of all cases in this study. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that more than 4 sexual partners within the last year and presence of N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis and/or M. genitalium infections were independent risk factors for urethral HPV infection, with odds ratios of 3.85 (95% CI 1.49-9.94) and 2.41 (95% CI 1.03-5.61), respectively. It is likely that urethral HPV detection is associated with current sexual activity and the presence of N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and/or M. genitalium infections.
TI  - [Susceptibility to antibiotics of microorganisms related with recurrent bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - There are presented data of sensitivity to a range of antibiotics of the main microorganisms related with the problem "recurrent bacterial vaginosis". G. vaginalis are sensitive in 34% to metronidazole, and 82% to clindamycin. Atopobium spp. and HP/+/Lactobacillus spp. are resistant to metronidazole and sensitive to clindamycin.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of thymol on native and mature Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms: in vitro study.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most frequent diagnosis made in women with lower  genital tract symptoms. It has recently been observed that 90 % of subjects with BV show the growth of bacteria in the form of biofilms as against only 10% without BV, and that Gardnerella vaginalis was the predominant species. The propensity of G. vaginalis to form biofilm is clinically relevant because this form of growth allows it to tolerate higher concentrations of certain antibiotics, thus increasing the possibilty of recurrent BV even after apparently curative therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether thymol (CAS 89-83-8), a molecule present in thyme essential oil, that is credited with having a series of pharmacological properties including antimicrobial and antifungal effects, can interfere with newly formed and mature G. vaginalis biofilms. The ability of G. vaginalis ATCC 49145 and two G. vaginalis strains isolated from human BV to form biofilm in flat-bottomed 96-well microtitre plates was verified, and the effects of thymol concentrations ranging from 1 to 1/16 MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) on preformed and mature biofilms was investigated by means of spectrophotometric analysis, Nomarski interference contrast microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy with live-dead cell visualisation (SYTO 9 and propidium iodide). Native biofilm was inhibited by concentrations ranging from 1 MIC to 1/8 MIC (32.77% +/- 2.37 to 11.39% +/- 1.46), and mature biofilm was inhibited by concentrations ranging from 1 MIC to 1/4 MIC (26.18% +/- 1.36 to 13.20% +/- 1.44). Nomarski interference contrast and fluorescence microscopy visually confirmed these findings. As biofilm is a multi-factorial phenomenon, the multiple mechanisms of thymol may act on different steps in the evolution of mature biofilm.
TI  - Inerolysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by Lactobacillus iners.
AB  - Lactobacillus iners is a common constituent of the human vaginal microbiota. This species was only recently characterized due to its fastidious growth requirements and has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. Here we present the identification and molecular characterization of a protein toxin produced by L. iners. The L. iners genome encodes an open reading frame with significant primary sequence similarity to intermedilysin (ILY; 69.2% similarity) and vaginolysin (VLY; 68.4% similarity), the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Streptococcus intermedius and Gardnerella vaginalis, respectively. Clinical isolates of L. iners produce this protein, inerolysin (INY), during growth in vitro, as assessed by Western analysis. INY is a pore-forming toxin that is activated by reducing agents and inhibited by excess cholesterol. It is active across a pH range of 4.5 to 6.0 but is inactive at pH 7.4. At sublytic concentrations, INY activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and allows entry of fluorescent phalloidin into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Unlike VLY and ILY, which are human specific, INY is active against cells from a broad range of species. INY represents a new target for studies directed at understanding the role of L. iners in states of health and disease at the vaginal mucosal surface.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis septicaemia with pyelonephritis, infective endocarditis and septic emboli in the kidney and brain of an adult male.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is typically associated with bacterial vaginosis in women.  However, balanitis, urethritis, urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteraemia have also been described in men. Here we report a case of G. vaginalis septicaemia with infective endocarditis and septic emboli in the kidney and brain of an adult male.
TI  - Bacterial species present in the lower male genital tract: a five-year retrospective study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify bacterial species present in the lower genital tract of males and to investigate the relationship with semen quality. METHODS: The microscopic analyses and cultures of 696 semen specimens, collected over five years from males investigated for subfertility, were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: Semen cultures were sterile in 48%; they showed a polymicrobial flora (more than two bacterial species) in 30%, and were positive (>1 x 10(3) colony forming units/ml) in 22% of the cases. Gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by Escherichia coli and Enterococcus sp. Ureaplasma urealyticum was recovered from 13 of 147 samples (9%). Of patients with bacteriospermia 42% had leukospermia (>10(6) leukocytes/ml of semen). Bacteriospermia and leukospermia did not correlate with each other although a positive correlation was found between the presence of leukocytes and G. vaginalis isolation. Semen parameters were correlated with the bacterial species isolated most frequently. In comparison with controls, sperm concentration, motility and morphology were mostly deteriorated in the presence of G. vaginalis and U. urealyticum. CONCLUSIONS: Positive seminal fluid cultures must be interpreted with caution, taking into account both raised colony counts of single isolates and leukocyte concentration in the semen. Thus the common misdiagnosis of genital tract infection, based on the presence of seminal bacteria, and unnecessary treatment with antibiotics may be avoided.
TI  - Tinidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the commonest cause of vaginal discharge in women of  childbearing age. Oral metronidazole has long been established as an effective therapy in the treatment of BV. However, adverse effects due to metronidazole are frequent and this may lead to problems with adherence to a 7-day course of treatment and subsequently result in treatment failure. Oral tinidazole has been used to treat bacterial vaginosis for over 25 years but in a number of different dosage regimens. Placebo controlled trials have consistently shown increases in cure rate with tinidazole. Longer courses of treatment (eg, 1 g daily for 5 days) appear to be more effective than a 2 g oral single dose. Comparative studies suggest that oral tinidazole is equivalent to oral metronidazole, intravaginal clindamycin cream, and intravaginal metronidazole tablets, in efficacy in treating BV. However, tinidazole has a more favorable side effect profile than oral metronidazole notably with better gastrointestinal tolerability and less metallic taste. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with high rates of recurrence and appropriate management of such recurrences can prove difficult. Recurrent BV has been linked with persistence of Gardnerella vaginalis after treatment; however the clinical implications of the possible greater activity of tinidazole against G. vaginalis are not yet clear. Repeated courses of oral metronidazole may be poorly tolerated and an alternative but equally effective treatment that is better tolerated may be preferable. In comparison to oral metronidazole, cost is clearly an issue as oral metronidazole is considerably cheaper and available in generic form. However where avoidance of oral metronidazole is necessary because of side effects, oral tinidazole is a cost-effective alternative.
TI  - Gardnerella biofilm involves females and males and is transmitted sexually.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence and distribution of adherent Gardnerella vaginalis. METHODS: Bacteria adherent to desquamated epithelial cells in the urine were detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Urine from patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV, n = 20), their partners (n = 10) and different control populations (n = 344) including pregnant women and their partners, randomly selected populations of hospitalized man, women and children as also healthy controls was investigated. RESULTS: Gardnerella was found in two different forms: cohesive and dispersed. In the cohesive form, Gardnerella were attached to the epithelial cells in groups of highly concentrated bacteria. In the dispersed form, solitary Gardnerella were intermixed with other bacterial groups. Cohesive Gardnerella was present in all patients with proven BV and their partners, in 7% of men and 13% of women hospitalized for reasons other than BV, in 16% of pregnant women and 12% of their male partners, and in none of the healthy laboratory staff or children. In sexual partners, occurrence of cohesive Gardnerella was clearly linked. Dispersed Gardnerella were found in 10-18% of randomly selected females, 3-4% of males and 10% of children and not sexually linked. In daily longitudinal investigations over 4 weeks no transition between cohesive and dispersed Gardnerella and vice versa was observed. Transmission of a cohesive Gardnerella strain could be followed retrospectively over 15 years using molecular genetic methods. CONCLUSIONS: Cohesive Gardnerella biofilm is a distinct, clearly definable entity which involves both genders and is sexually transmitted. The correct name distinguishing it from symptom-defined conditions like BV should be gardnerellosis and for the bacterium Gardnerella genitalis.
TI  - Response of Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm to 5 days of moxifloxacin treatment.
AB  - Polymicrobial communities are often recalcitrant to antibiotics. We tested whether the polymicrobial Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm can be eradicated with moxifloxacin. Twenty women with bacterial vaginosis were treated with 400 mg moxifloxacin for 5 days. The changes in the occurrence and proportions of Gardnerella, Atopobium and Lactobacillus spp. were assessed using FISH. The bacterial biofilm was investigated using desquamated epithelial cells of spontaneously voided urine and sections of vaginal biopsies. Fifteen of 20 women showed a significant and sustained clinical response to moxifloxacin according to Amsel and Nugent criteria. The concentrations of adherent bacteria decreased significantly. The incidence and proportion of Atopobium declined sustainably. The proportions of Lactobacillus in the biofilm mass increased following therapy. Initially, Gardnerella was the main component of the polymicrobial biofilm. Following treatment, Gardnerella was not accessible to FISH in the urine and vaginal samples of 75% of all women. Ten to 12 weeks after the end of therapy, Gardnerella biofilm was cumulatively present in 40%. This was not due to newly acquired disease, but due to reactivation of the persisting, but biochemically inactive biofilm. Despite clear clinical efficacy, and initially definite suppression of the biofilm, moxifloxacin was, similar to metronidazole, not able to eradicate the Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm in all patients.
TI  - Clinicopathological study of Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for diagnosing of cervical infections.
AB  - Cervical infections are not uncommon in our population especially in young and sexually active women. One thousand samples of married women, aged between 20 and 70 years, were studied by conventional Papanicolaou smears. These samples were examined in the Department of Pathology, King Edward Medical University, Lahore from January 2007 to June 2009. Only cases without (pre)neoplastic cytology were included. Six types of infections were diagnosed cytologically. The overall frequency of normal, inadequate, neoplastic, and infective smears was 50%, 1.8%, 10.2%, and 38.3%, respectively. Most of the patients (67%) were in the reproductive age group with mean age 34.7 +/- 2.6 years. The commonest clinical sign seen in 354/383 (92%) cases and symptom in (349/383; 91%) cases were vaginal discharge and pruritis vulvae. Among the infective smears, 290 cases (75.7%), the cytologic diagnosis was nonspecific inflammation. Most of these 290 smears contained clue cells (indicating Gardnerella infection) and a lack of lactobacilli. Such smears are predominant in patients suffering from bacterial vaginosis (BV). Twenty-eight smears (7.3%) were positive for Trichomonas vaginalis, 27 cases (7%) were smears with koilocytic change pathognomonic of human papilloma virus infection. Twenty-five smears (6.5%) were positive for fungal infection. Seven cases (1.8%) were diagnosed as herpes simplex virus infection. Finally, there were six cases (1.5%) with atrophic vaginitis. We conclude that the cervical smear is well suited for diagnosing cervical infections. It is clear that Gardnerella, known to be associated with bacterial vaginosis, is a major problem in our Pakistani population.
TI  - [An unusual endometritis].
AB  - We report a case of pyometra without any related risk factor. This leads to a severe septic shock. Evolution was successful because of quick surgical management. We report literature management of such infection. Although pyometra is an uncommon disease, it should be kept in mind as delayed management may lead to fatal outcome.
TI  - Detection of sexually transmitted infection and human papillomavirus in negative  cytology by multiplex-PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and 15 species that cause sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in negative cytology. In addition, we compared the diagnostic performance of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with widely available techniques used to detect HPV. METHODS: We recruited 235 women of reproductive age who had negative cytology findings in a liquid-based cervical smear. STIs were identified by multiplex PCR, and HPV genotypes by multiplex PCR, hybrid capture 2, and DNA microaray; discordant results were analyzed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Approximately 96.6% of patients with negative cytology results were positive for pathogens that cause STIs. The pathogens most frequently detected were Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum. The incidence of HPV in negative cytology was 23.3%. Low-risk HPV infection was significantly correlated with Chalmaydia trachomatis, and high-risk HPV infection was significantly correlated with Group beta streptococcus. The analytical sensitivities of the multiplex PCR and DNA microarray were higher than 80%, and the analytical specificity was nearly 100% for all tests. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR yielded results that most of patients with negative cytology were positive for pathogens that cause STIs, and were more similar to that of DNA microarray, than that of hybrid capture 2 in terms of analytical sensitivity and prediction value of HPV infection.
TI  - Comparative genomics of Gardnerella vaginalis strains reveals substantial differences in metabolic and virulence potential.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gardnerella vaginalis is described as a common vaginal bacterial species whose presence correlates strongly with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Here we report the genome sequencing and comparative analyses of three strains of G. vaginalis. Strains 317 (ATCC 14019) and 594 (ATCC 14018) were isolated from the vaginal tracts of women with symptomatic BV, while Strain 409-05 was isolated from a healthy, asymptomatic individual with a Nugent score of 9. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Substantial genomic rearrangement and heterogeneity were observed that appeared to have resulted from both mobile elements and substantial lateral gene transfer. These genomic differences translated to differences in metabolic potential. All strains are equipped with significant virulence potential, including genes encoding the previously described vaginolysin, pili for cytoadhesion, EPS biosynthetic genes for biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance systems, We also observed systems promoting multi-drug and lantibiotic extrusion. All G. vaginalis strains possess a large number of genes that may enhance their ability to compete with and exclude other vaginal colonists. These include up to six toxin-antitoxin systems and up to nine additional antitoxins lacking cognate toxins, several of which are clustered within each genome. All strains encode bacteriocidal toxins, including two lysozyme-like toxins produced uniquely by strain 409-05. Interestingly, the BV isolates encode numerous proteins not found in strain 409-05 that likely increase their pathogenic potential. These include enzymes enabling mucin degradation, a trait previously described to strongly correlate with BV, although commonly attributed to non-G. vaginalis species. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our results indicate that all three strains are able to thrive in vaginal environments, and therein the BV isolates are capable of occupying a niche that is unique from 409-05. Each strain has significant virulence potential, although genomic and metabolic differences, such as the ability to degrade mucin, indicate that the detection of G. vaginalis in the vaginal tract provides only partial information on the physiological potential of the organism.
TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of quantitative real-time PCR assay versus clinical and Gram  stain identification of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis versus the standard methods, the Amsel criteria and the Nugent score. The Amsel criteria, the Nugent score, and results from the molecular tool were obtained independently from vaginal samples of 163 pregnant women who reported abnormal vaginal symptoms before 20 weeks gestation. To determine the performance of the molecular tool, we calculated the kappa value, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Either or both of the Amsel criteria (>/=3 criteria) and the Nugent score (score >/=7) indicated that 25 women (15%) had bacterial vaginosis, and the remaining 138 women did not. DNA levels of Gardnerella vaginalis or Atopobium vaginae exceeded 10(9) copies/mL or 10(8) copies/mL, respectively, in 34 (21%) of the 163 samples. Complete agreement between both reference methods and high concentrations of G. vaginalis and A. vaginae was found in 94.5% of women (154/163 samples, kappa value = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.70-0.81). The nine samples with discordant results were categorized as intermediate flora by the Nugent score. The molecular tool predicted bacterial vaginosis with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 73%, and a negative predictive value of 100%. The quantitative real-time PCR assay shows excellent agreement with the results of both reference methods for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of bacterial vaginosis and other types of abnormal vaginal bacterial flora: a review.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge. It is characterised by an overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic organisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., Peptostreptocci, Mobiluncus spp.) in the vagina leading to a replacement of lactobacilli and an increase in vaginal pH. BV can arise and remit spontaneously, but often presents as a chronic or recurrent disease. BV is found most often in women of childbearing age, but may also be encountered in menopausal women, and is rather rare in children. The clinical and microscopic features and diagnosis of BV are herein reviewed, and antibiotic and non-antibiotic treatment approaches discussed. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this educational activity, the participant should be better able to analyze bacterial vaginosis clinically, formulate an oral antibiotic treatment regimen for bacterial vaginosis and use vaginal treatments for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Deep sequencing of the vaginal microbiota of women with HIV.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women living with HIV and co-infected with bacterial vaginosis (BV) are at higher risk for transmitting HIV to a partner or newborn. It is poorly understood which bacterial communities constitute BV or the normal vaginal microbiota among this population and how the microbiota associated with BV responds to antibiotic treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The vaginal microbiota of 132 HIV positive Tanzanian women, including 39 who received metronidazole treatment for BV, were profiled using Illumina to sequence the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Of note, Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus iners were detected in each sample constituting core members of the vaginal microbiota. Eight major clusters were detected with relatively uniform microbiota compositions. Two clusters dominated by L. iners or L. crispatus were strongly associated with a normal microbiota. The L. crispatus dominated microbiota were associated with low pH, but when L. crispatus was not present, a large fraction of L. iners was required to predict a low pH. Four clusters were strongly associated with BV, and were dominated by Prevotella bivia, Lachnospiraceae, or a mixture of different species. Metronidazole treatment reduced the microbial diversity and perturbed the BV-associated microbiota, but rarely resulted in the establishment of a lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: Illumina based microbial profiling enabled high though-put analyses of microbial samples at a high phylogenetic resolution. The vaginal microbiota among women living with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa constitutes several profiles associated with a normal microbiota or BV. Recurrence of BV frequently constitutes a different BV-associated profile than before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  - The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. The activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. An overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of CDCs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. The way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. Their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (MACPF) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. In this chapter I aim to provide an overview of our understanding of the interaction between CDCs and other members of what is now called the MACPF/CDC superfamily, with their target membranes. CDCs (also in the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four Gram-positive bacterial genera (Clostridium, Listeria, Bacillus and Streptococcus). Well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. Listeriolysin from L. monocytogenes is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. Perfringolysin from C. perfringens (Fig. 1A) has become perhaps the most studied CDC4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). Streptolysin from S. pyogenes is another intensely studied CDC and has been applied widely in experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. Pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for S. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. However, CDCs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone Metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. The homology with the MACPF family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic MACPF/CDC fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (Fig. 1A and D). Without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. The glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that CDCs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. While not all MACPF domains are involved in pore formation-for example, C6 and C8beta--they are all apparently involved in action on membranes. The dramatic refolding undergone by CDCs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the MACPF/CDC domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (Fig. 1A-C). It is obviously the basic assumption that where nonCDC members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 Even where a member of the MACPF/CDC superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. However, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another MACPF/CDC family member or members from the same specific system. Complement acts by a combination of the C5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting C9 to form a lesion, which may be a complete ring of C9 associated with the C5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.Perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). Incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.
TI  - Efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) prevention. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred twenty healthy Chinese women with a history of recurrent BV were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (Probaclac Vaginal; Nicar Laboratories, Inc, Blainville, Quebec, Canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, L acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days on. RESULTS: Probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for BV (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; P < .001) and Gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; P = .02). Between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of BV and G vaginalis. Aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. CONCLUSION: Short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces BV recurrence and G vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.
TI  - Dissimilarity in the occurrence of Bifidobacteriaceae in vaginal and perianal microbiota in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Recent data point at the similarity between the perianal and vaginal microflora in terms of Lactobacillus species involved. Bacterial vaginosis, the most common perturbation of the vaginal microflora involving primarily overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis, has also been suggested to involve a recto-vaginal pathway. We addressed this issue with regard to bacteria of the Bifidobacteriaceae family. In particular, we investigated the putative concordance of the presence of G. vaginalis and a series of Bifidobacteria between the perianal and vaginal microflora in 10 patients with bacterial vaginosis through multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of desquamated epithelial cells. G. vaginalis was found in a biofilm mode of growth at the perianal and vaginal sites. In most women at least one of the following species was detected perianally: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breves, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. At the vaginal site, none of these Bifidobacteria was found. We conclude that bacterial vaginosis does not occur as a result of simple growth per continuum of perianal bacteria. Only some species originating from the intestinal tract do display pronounced vaginotropism, like G. vaginalis, whereas many other species do not.
TI  - An antimicrobial investigation of plants used traditionally in southern Africa to treat sexually transmitted infections.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Eighteen plants were assessed for antimicrobial activity against pathogens associated with prevalent urogenital/sexually transmitted infections. Plant selection was based on information obtained from the ethnobotanical literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried plant material was submerged in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and dichloromethane for 24 h. Aqueous extracts were prepared by submerging dried plant material in sterile distilled water for 24 h followed by lyophilization. Essential oils were distilled from the two aromatic plant species (Tarchonanthus camphoratus and Croton gratissimus). Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the micro-well minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay with specific modifications to facilitate fastidious growth of pathogens. RESULTS: Tarchonanthus camphoratus (solvent extract) showed the most significant broad spectrum activity with MIC values ranging between 0.50 and 0.70 mg/ml against five of the six pathogens tested. Other noteworthy activity was found for Hypericum aethiopicum (root) at 0.3 mg/ml (Neisseria gonorrhoeae).Polygala fruticosa and the solvent root extract of Hypericum aethiopicum showed highest sensitivities towards Gardnerella vaginalis at 0.2 mg/ml. Efficacy of the solvent extracts against the pathogen Oligella ureolytica demonstrated antimicrobial activity (MIC values <or=1.0 mg/ml) for seven plant species. The highest activity noted against Ureaplasma urealyticum was for Psidium guajava (solvent extract) at 0.8 mg/ml. In general the aqueous extracts displayed mostly poor anti-STI activity. The most noteworthy susceptibility for the aqueous extracts was noted with the plant extract Syzygium cordatum (MIC value 0.1 mg/ml against Candida albicans). The most noteworthy activity for the essential oils was observed for Tarchonanthus camphoratus (0.8 mg/ml) against Oligella ureolytica. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial activity was observed for a number of the plant samples against at least one or more pathogen, thus validating the ethnobotanical use as an anti-infective to treat sexually transmitted diseases.
TI  - Chronic vulvitis in pre-pubertal girls.
AB  - Pre-pubertal girls with inflammatory chronic vulval disease excluding lichen sclerosus are often described as having 'non-specific vulvovaginitis'. The aim of this retrospective case series was to determine the aetiology of chronic vulvovaginitis in pre-pubertal (Tanner Stage 1) girls, with particular reference to candidiasis. A chart review recorded and compared the characteristics of 38 girls and 68 post-menarchal adolescents and pre-menopausal women with chronic vulvitis. Nineteen (50%) of the pre-pubertal children had been previously diagnosed with candidiasis and 21 (55%) had been treated unsuccessfully with topical antifungal agents. Candida albicans was isolated in two (5%) of the children and 37 (54%) of the adults (P < 0.001). A positive Candida culture was causally associated with chronic vulvovaginitis in 50% of the adults but in none of the children (P < 0.001). In 28 (74%) of the children and 28 (41%) of the adults, no pathogens were isolated on microbiological testing. General skin examination of the girls revealed signs of psoriasis in 27 (71%) and atopic dermatitis in nine (24%). Symptoms were controlled with topical anti-inflammatory treatment and environmental modification, including cessation of topical antifungals. Pre-pubertal girls with chronic vulvitis are likely to have either psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis is not seen in Tanner Stage 1 girls.
TI  - Drawing the line between commensal and pathogenic Gardnerella vaginalis through genome analysis and virulence studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder. It is associated with risk for preterm birth and HIV infection. The etiology of the condition has been debated for nearly half a century and the lack of knowledge about its cause and progression has stymied efforts to improve therapy and prevention. Gardnerella vaginalis was originally identified as the causative agent, but subsequent findings that it is commonly isolated from seemingly healthy women cast doubt on this claim. Recent studies shedding light on the virulence properties of G. vaginalis, however, have drawn the species back into the spotlight. RESULTS: In this study, we sequenced the genomes of a strain of G. vaginalis from a healthy woman, and one from a woman with bacterial vaginosis. Comparative analysis of the genomes revealed significant divergence and in vitro studies indicated disparities in the virulence potential of the two strains. The commensal isolate exhibited reduced cytotoxicity and yet the cytolysin proteins encoded by the two strains were nearly identical, differing at a single amino acid, and were transcribed at similar levels. The BV-associated strain encoded a different variant of a biofilm associated protein gene and demonstrated greater adherence, aggregation, and biofilm formation. Using filters with different pore sizes, we found that direct contact between the bacteria and epithelial cells is required for cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that contact is required for cytotoxicity and suggested that reduced cytotoxicity in the commensal isolate could be due to impaired adherence. This study outlines two distinct genotypic variants of G. vaginalis, one apparently commensal and one pathogenic, and presents evidence for disparate virulence potentials.
TI  - Antagonism and synergism in Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Antagonistic and synergistic substances are important for interactions between micro-organisms associated with human body surfaces, either in healthy or in diseased conditions. In the present study, such compounds produced by Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) were detected in vitro and the antagonistic ones were partially characterized. Among 11 G. vaginalis strains tested, all showed antagonistic activity against at least one of the 22 indicator bacteria assayed. Interestingly, for some of these strains, antagonism reverted to synergism, favouring one of the indicator strains (Peptostreptococcus anaerobius) when the growth medium was changed. Partial characterization of antagonistic substances suggested a bacteriocin-like chemical nature. Depending on growth conditions, G. vaginalis isolated from women with BV produced antagonistic or synergistic compounds for other bacterial components of the vaginal ecosystem. This is the first report to our knowledge of the production of antagonistic and/or synergistic substances by G. vaginalis. This ability may be a pivotal factor in understanding BV and the ecological role of this bacterium in the vaginal environment.
TI  - Diagnosis of vulvovaginitis: comparison of clinical and microbiological diagnosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to compare the current diagnostic clinical and laboratory approaches to women with vulvovaginal discharge complaint. The secondary outcomes were to determine the prevalence of infections in our setting and to look for the relation between vulvovaginal infections and predisposing factors if present. METHOD: Premenopausal women applying to our gynecology outpatient clinic with vaginal discharge complaint were enrolled prospectively into the study. Each patient evaluated clinically with direct observation of vaginal secretions, wet mount examination, whiff test, vaginal pH testing and chlamydia rapid antigen test. Each patient also evaluated microbiologically with vaginal discharge culture and gram staining. Clinical diagnosis was compared with the microbiological diagnosis (the gold standard). Diagnostic accuracy was measured with sensitivity, specificity, positive (ppv) and negative predictive values (npv). RESULTS: 460 patients were included in the study. 89.8% of patients received a clinical diagnosis whereas only 36% of them had microbiological diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv of clinical diagnosis over microbiological culture results were 95, 13, 38, 82%, respectively. The most commonly encountered microorganisms by culture were Candida species (17.4%) and Gardnerella vaginalis (10.2%). Clinically, the most commonly made diagnoses were mixed infection (34.1%), bacterial vaginosis (32.4%) and fungal infection (14.1%). Symptoms did not predict laboratory results. Predisposing factors (DM, vaginal douching practice, presence of IUD and usage of oral contraceptive pills) were not found to be statistically important influencing factors for vaginal infections. CONCLUSION: Clinical diagnosis based on combining symptoms with office-based testing improves diagnostic accuracy but is insufficient. The most effective approach also incorporates laboratory testing as an adjunct when a diagnosis is in question or treatment is failing.
TI  - Temporal variability of human vaginal bacteria and relationship with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about short-term bacterial fluctuations in the human  vagina. This study used PCR to assess the variability in concentrations of key vaginal bacteria in healthy women and the immediate response to antibiotic treatment in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-two women assessed for BV using Amsel's criteria were evaluated daily for 7 or 14 days, then at 2, 3 and 4 weeks, using a panel of 11 bacterium-specific quantitative PCR assays. Participants with BV were treated with 5 days of intravaginal metronidazole. Participants without BV had vaginal biotas dominated by lactobacilli, whose levels fluctuated with menses. With onset of menstruation, quantities of Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus crispatus decreased and were found to be inversely related to Gardnerella vaginalis concentrations (p<0.001). Women with BV had a variety of fastidious bacteria whose concentrations dropped below detection thresholds 1-5 days after starting metronidazole. Recurrent BV was characterized by initial profound decreases of BV-associated bacteria after treatment followed by subsequent increases at relapse. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The microbiota of the human vagina can be highly dynamic. Healthy women are colonized with Lactobacillus species, but levels can change dramatically over a month. Marked increases in G. vaginalis were observed during menses. Participants with BV have diverse communities of fastidious bacteria that are depleted by vaginal metronidazole therapy. Women with recurrent BV initially respond to antibiotic treatment with steep declines in bacterial concentrations, but these bacteria later reemerge, suggesting that antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is not an important factor mediating BV recurrence.
TI  - Gardnerella, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in the genital discharge of symptomatic fertile and asymptomatic infertile women.
AB  - This study aimed to establish the different prevalence of the microorganisms investigated in the two groups considered: fertile women with symptoms and asymptomatic women with infertility problems. The data from women (n= 952) investigated for two years for quality of genital discharge and the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyiticum and Chlamydia trachomatis were retrospectively analyzed. In the population of fertile women with symptoms the microrganisms most frequently involved are Gardnerella vaginalis (26.6%), Candida species (12.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (9.2%). The genital discharges of asymptomatic women with infertility problems are characterized by a prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis (19.7%), Enterobacteriaceae or Enterococci (12.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (8.6%). The reduction of vaginal lactobacilli flora and the presence of an elevated number of polymorphonucleates in the vaginal discharge are important parameters to consider for the evaluation of the health status of the human female urogenital tract. Our results indicate that is important to culture the vaginal discharge for Streptococcus agalactiae and for prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci. Lastly, the reasons for the prevalence of some microorganisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococci, Streptococcus agalactiae) in the population of infertile asymptomatic women need to be better analyzed especially after the recent studies correlating idiopathic infertility with the presence of cervical cytokines in women with an abnormal vaginal flora.
TI  - [Evaluation of microbiological diagnostics in urogenital infections in postmenopausal women].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the percentage of infections in postmenopausal women with urinary symptoms which can be confirmed by microbiological analysis, the most common causative agents and whether the urethra and vagina in patients with cystitis are concurrently colonized by pathogenic microorganisms. METHODS: Laboratories of the Croatian National Institute of Public Health in Zagreb, in the period of two years, analyzed 245 samples taken from patients with urinary symptoms who had been postmenopausal at least for a year. Urine samples, as well as urethral and vaginal swabs were taken from each patient and tested for causative agents of urogenital infections, genital mycoplasma and Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS: Cystitis was confirmed by microbiological analysis in 31.4% women, urethritis in 24.8%, and vaginitis in 15.1%. The most common causative agent of urethritis was Ureaplasma urealyticum, while Gardnerella vaginalis was the most common in vaginal infections. E. coli was concurrently isolated in urine, urethral and vaginal samples in 65.1% of patients with E. coli cystitis, while Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in urethral and vaginal samples in each patient with Streptococcus agalactiae cystitis. CONCLUSION: Mucosal colonization of the urethra and vagina contributes to the incidence of cystitis in postmenopausal women. Microbiological diagnostics is necessary to distinguish between the symptoms of ageing of the urogenital system and infection, with a view to preventing unnecessary antibiotic therapy.
TI  - The epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis in relation to sexual behaviour.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) has been most consistently linked to sexual  behaviour, and the epidemiological profile of BV mirrors that of established sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It remains a matter of debate however whether BV pathogenesis does actually involve sexual transmission of pathogenic micro-organisms from men to women. We therefore made a critical appraisal of the literature on BV in relation to sexual behaviour. DISCUSSION: G. vaginalis carriage and BV occurs rarely with children, but has been observed among adolescent, even sexually non-experienced girls, contradicting that sexual transmission is a necessary prerequisite to disease acquisition. G. vaginalis carriage is enhanced by penetrative sexual contact but also by non-penetrative digito-genital contact and oral sex, again indicating that sex per se, but not necessarily coital transmission is involved. Several observations also point at female-to-male rather than at male-to-female transmission of G. vaginalis, presumably explaining the high concordance rates of G. vaginalis carriage among couples. Male antibiotic treatment has not been found to protect against BV, condom use is slightly protective, whereas male circumcision might protect against BV. BV is also common among women-who-have-sex-with-women and this relates at least in part to non-coital sexual behaviours. Though male-to-female transmission cannot be ruled out, overall there is little evidence that BV acts as an STD. Rather, we suggest BV may be considered a sexually enhanced disease (SED), with frequency of intercourse being a critical factor. This may relate to two distinct pathogenetic mechanisms: (1) in case of unprotected intercourse alkalinisation of the vaginal niche enhances a shift from lactobacilli-dominated microflora to a BV-like type of microflora and (2) in case of unprotected and protected intercourse mechanical transfer of perineal enteric bacteria is enhanced by coitus. A similar mechanism of mechanical transfer may explain the consistent link between non-coital sexual acts and BV. Similar observations supporting the SED pathogenetic model have been made for vaginal candidiasis and for urinary tract infection. SUMMARY: Though male-to-female transmission cannot be ruled out, overall there is incomplete evidence that BV acts as an STI. We believe however that BV may be considered a sexually enhanced disease, with frequency of intercourse being a critical factor.
TI  - Correlation of Trichomonas vaginalis to bacterial vaginosis: a laboratory-based study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to define the occurrence of different organisms causing vulvovaginitis; to evaluate different laboratory methods used for diagnosis of Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis); and to evaluate the direct score system and clue cell method compared with culture for diagnosis of bacterial and T. vaginalis vaginosis. METHODOLOGY: Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed for 110 patients. Laboratory methods used for bacteriological diagnosis were direct Gram staining for clue cells and scoring by Nugent score system and bacterial culture. T. vaginalis was identified by wet mount microscopic examination, culture, direct Gram, Giemsa staining and acridine orange (AO). RESULTS: The Nugent score method revealed that the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of vaginal discharge by direct rapid microscopic methods were 30% and 80% and for clue cells sensitivity and specificity were 37% and 75% respectively for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis compared to culture. For diagnosis of T. vaginalis, the Nugent score method revealed that the sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 90% respectively, and for clue cells 75% and 80% respectively. For microcopic methods used for T. vaginalis only, the Gram stain and Giemsa stain sensitivities were poor (15.2% and 48.5%, respectively). Wet mount showed reasonable sensitivity of 75.8%. Acridine orange sensitivity was 93.9% and specificity was 97.5%, CONCLUSION: Prevalent pathogens associated with vaginitis were (Gardnerella vaginalis) G. vaginalis, T. vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis (M. hominis). Wet mount microscopic examination, acridine orange, and high Nugent score were found as rapid and sensitive methods for diagnosis of T. vaginalis.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - PURPOSE: to study the clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis participating in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, which compared the vaginal use of preparations from red pepper tree and metronidazole for the treatment of genital discharge. METHODS: the study was conducted on a series of 277 women with bacterial vaginosis concomitantly diagnosed by the criteria of Amsel and Nugent, selected from a total of 462 recruited patients using the information obtained before intervention. Data were analyzed with the Epi-Info 3.32 software. In order to compare the outcomes frequencies between the intervention groups, the chi2 test was used and the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. The intention to treat analysis was performed. In addition to the determination of diagnostic parameters, the culture of vaginal content and a Papanicolaou cytology test were also performed. RESULTS: the most frequent clinical complaints were genital discharge, observed in 206 participants (74.4%) and the fish odor of the vaginal secretion, which occurred in 68.6% of the cases (190 patients). Among the diagnostic clinical criteria, the presence of clue-cells was positive in 275 women (99.3%), the Whiff test, in 266 (96.0%), followed by pH >4.5, which occurred in 92.8% of the cases, and by the presence of fluid grayish discharge reported by 206 participants (74.4%). Regarding the Nugent criterion, the median score was 8.0. Culture of the vaginal content permitted the identification of Gardnerella vaginalis in 96.8% of cases and of Mobiluncus in 53.1%. Only one third of the exams showed the presence of Lactobacillus (89 women - 32.1%). Fungal growth occurred in the cultures of 14 participants (5.1%). In most cases, culture revealed the presence of Corynebacterium (94.2%), Gram-positive cocci (98.2%), as well as Gram-positive (99.3%) and Gram-negative (91.0%) bacilli. Oncotic colposcopy revealed a very scarce presence of lactobacilli, which were present in only 8 cytological exams (2.9%) out of the total of 273 exams performed. CONCLUSIONS: the results of the present study did not differ from the literature regarding the symptoms reported by the women, the clinical criteria most frequently observed in the diagnosis, or the bacterial species detected in cultures of vaginal content. These findings indicate the need for further studies that might better elucidate the interrelations between the microbiological findings and the clinical expression of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against vaginolysin: mapping of a region critical for its cytolytic activity.
AB  - Vaginolysin (VLY) is a protein toxin released by Gardnerella vaginalis. VLY belongs to the group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs). We have generated a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against VLY. For the generation of MAbs, we have used recombinant VLY expressed in Escherichia coli. The functional activity of recombinant VLY was confirmed by an in vitro hemolytic assay using human erythrocytes. The MAbs raised against recombinant VLY were reactive with VLY from G. vaginalis both by Western blot and ELISA. The cross-reactivity of MAbs with other CDCs was investigated. For this purpose, recombinant cytolysins perfringolysin, listeriolysin, intermedilysin, pneumolysin and streptolysin were expressed in E. coli. The MAbs were specific exclusively to VLY and did not react with other CDCs. All MAbs were studied for the ability to neutralize hemolytic activity of VLY in vitro and several neutralizing MAbs were identified. The MAb produced by clone 9B4 showed the most potent neutralizing activity. The epitope for this MAb was localized near the N-terminus of VLY, between amino acid (aa) residues 112 and 268. The region recognized by the neutralizing MAb 9B4 includes the conserved motif (VAARMQYD, aa 189-196) supposed to be involved in VLY oligomerization. Selected MAbs were employed to develop a sandwich ELISA for VLY quantification. The MAb-based immunoassay was suitable for the detection of VLY in the cultures of G. vaginalis. In conclusion, the MAbs described in the current study may be useful for structural and functional studies of VLY as well as immunodetection of VLY in biological specimens.
TI  - Prevalence of clue cells suggestive for Gardnerella vaginalis in population-based cervical screening in the public versus private health care in Maringa, Parana, Brazil.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of clue cells suggestive for Gardnerella  vaginalis in population-based cervical screening in the public (SUS) versus private (RP) health care utilization in Maringa, Parana, Brazil. METHODS: A retrospective study on the results of 133,966 cytology examinations of patients from the Brazilian Public Health System-SUS (better socio-economic status-SES) and from the Private Network-RP (low SES) done by the Souza Anatomy Laboratory in Maringa, Brazil, from 2004 to 2007. RESULTS: In patients using the SUS, the prevalence of clue cells was 6.75% (n = 3,573), higher (p < 0.05) than for RP users (3.53%, n = 2,813). The clue cells predominated in age range of the 20-49 years from the SUS and RP (p > 0.05). In both the populations, the prevalence and age range did not vary among the 4 years (p > 0.05) and the prevalence declines in age above 45 years (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of clue cells was low and stable in both populations in the 4 years, indicating equilibrium in terms of numbers of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in this localization. The results indicate that SES may influence the epidemiology of BV and that the prevalence declines expressively in older women.
TI  - [Vaginal ectopia of urethra as a cause of chronic recurrent cystitis in women: diagnosis and treatment].
AB  - Ectopia of the urethral opening (female hypospadia) often causes chronic recurrent cystitis in women because of a retrograde delivery of urogenital infection from the introitus and vagina to the short wide urethra and urinary bladder. Etiologically, cystitis develops due to pathogenic vaginal microflora: Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma, urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida, E. coli and other gram-negative bacteria. In 64 female patients aged 16-57 years with female hypospadia (FH) the diagnosis was made by O'Donnel-Hirchhorn symptom. Identification of urinary and vaginal microflora was made using polymerase chain reaction. Radical treatment of chronic recurrent cystitis in FH is surgical transposition of the distal urethra and its opening in the typical place with pre- and perioperative anti-inflammatory therapy according to the pathogen or with drugs having combined antimycotic and antiprotosoic properties. One of such drugs safocid demonstrates a rapid therapeutic effect in mixed urogenital infections causing chronic recurrent cystitis in women.
TI  - Prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis infection in women attending a major gynaecological hospital in Greece: a cross-sectional study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis is not accurately estimated,  since it is not a reportable disease. AIMS: To assess the prevalence of T vaginalis infection in women attending a Greek gynaecological hospital and to evaluate four diagnostic methods for T vaginalis infection. METHODS: 255 symptomatic and 247 asymptomatic women were included in the study during 2006-07; 372 were Greek and 130 were immigrants. T vaginalis was detected in vaginal samples, using wet mount, culture in modified Diamond's medium, antigen detection and two PCR assays, targeting different regions of T vaginalis genome. Specimens were considered positive for T vaginalis, when tested positive either by culture or by both PCRs. RESULTS: 23 women (4.6%) were positive for T vaginalis. Seven of the 23 positive samples (30.4%) were only PCR-positive. Infection was more prevalent in symptomatic women (6.7%) than in asymptomatic ones (2.4%). T vaginalis was more frequently detected in immigrants (7.9%) than in Greek women (3.3%). Gardnerella vaginalis infection was significantly more frequent in women infected with T vaginalis. PCR was the most sensitive method (100%), followed by culture (69.6%), wet mount (69.6%) and latex agglutination (54.6%). Agreement between PCR and culture as well as wet mount examination was very good (kappa=0.79). CONCLUSIONS: The study shows a relatively low percentage of trichomoniasis in the female population living in Athens. The infection was more prevalent among immigrants, and a proportion of the infected women was asymptomatic. The tested methods had good agreement and PCR was found to improve the diagnostic yield considerably.
TI  - Individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC933 and vaginal strain Lactobacillus gasseri KS120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  - The mechanism underlying the killing activity of Lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. Here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. In co-culture, the human intestinal strain Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC933 and human vaginal strain Lactobacillus gasseri KS120.1 strains killed enteric Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344, vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis DSM 4944 and urinary tract Escherichia coli CFT073 pathogens. The cell-free culture supernatants (CFCSs) produced the same reduction in SL1344, DSM 4944 and CFT073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. The killing activity of CFCSs was heat-stable. In the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, CFCSs were less effective at killing of the pathogens. Catalase-treated CFCSs displayed a strong decreased activity. Tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. Lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only at concentrations higher than that present in CFCSs. In the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in Lactobacillus CFCSs, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of Lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.
TI  - Metronidazole is still the drug of choice for treatment of anaerobic infections.
AB  - Metronidazole has been used for the treatment of infections for >45 years and is  still successfully used for the treatment of trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, and giardiasis. Anaerobic bacterial infections caused by Bacteroides species, fusobacteria, and clostridia respond favorably to metronidazole therapy. Good clinical results in the treatment of vaginosis due to Gardnerella vaginalis have also been reported. Rates of resistance to metronidazole are still generally low; however, several studies have reported decreased susceptibility among Bacteroides species, as well as different mechanisms of resistance. Metronidazole-resistant Helicobacter pylori strains have been described, but combination therapy (eg, metronidazole, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin plus omeprazole) is still recommended for eradication of this pathogen in patients with gastroduodenal ulcers. Metronidazole is considered to be a cost-effective drug because of its low cost, good activity against pathogenic anaerobic bacteria, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and minor adverse effects. Metronidazole is still the criterion standard for therapy of anaerobic infections, as was described by Tally and colleagues 35 years ago.
TI  - High vaginal concentrations of Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis in women undergoing preterm labor.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relationship between vaginal quantification of the main microorganisms related with bacterial vaginosis and the risk of preterm delivery among women with preterm labor. METHODS: Molecular methods were used to prospectively quantify Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Mycoplasma hominis in vaginal fluid samples from women admitted for spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes from July 2007 through July 2008. The primary outcome measure was the relationship between bacterial concentration at admission and preterm delivery, before 37 weeks of gestation. Sensitivity and specificity of molecular cutoff values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the University of British Columbia Bayesian Calculator type 2. RESULTS: Of the 90 women included, 36 delivered before 37 weeks of gestation (40%). Preterm delivery was not associated with the presence of Lactobacillus species, G vaginalis, A vaginae, or M hominis. In contrast, molecular quantification detected high concentrations of A vaginae (10(6)/mL or more: 25.0% in the preterm group and 9.3% in the term group, P=.04) and G vaginalis (10(7)/mL or more: 16.7% and 3.7%, P=.03) more often in women with preterm deliveries compared with term deliveries. Moreover, high vaginal concentrations of these two microorganisms together were associated with a significantly (P=.03) shorter interval between preterm labor and delivery (46 days, 95% CI 30-61) than were lower concentrations (85 days, 95% CI 75-95). The hazard ratio for a short preterm labor-to-delivery interval was three times higher for high vaginal fluid concentrations of A vaginae and G vaginalis than for lower concentrations (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-9.5, P=.03). CONCLUSION: The risk of preterm delivery is significantly associated with high vaginal concentrations of A vaginae and G vaginalis in women with preterm labor.

TI  - Glycerol monolaurate inhibits Candida and Gardnerella vaginalis in vitro and in vivo but not Lactobacillus.
AB  - We investigated the effects of glycerol monolaurate (GML) on Lactobacillus, Candida, and Gardnerella vaginalis human vaginal microflora. Our previous work demonstrated that 6 months of GML treatment vaginally does not alter lactobacillus counts in monkeys. Candida and G. vaginalis are commonly associated with vaginal infections in women, many becoming chronic or recurrent. In vitro growth inhibition studies determined the effects of GML (0 to 500 microg/ml) against multiple Candida species and G. vaginalis. A randomized, double-blind study investigated the effects of GML on vaginal microflora Lactobacillus, Candida, and G. vaginalis in colonized or infected women (n=36). Women self-administered intravaginal gels containing 0% (n=14), 0.5% (n=13), or 5% (n=9) GML every 12 h for 2 days. Vaginal swabs were collected before and immediately after the first gel administration and 12 h after the final gel administration. Swabs were tested for Lactobacillus, Candida, G. vaginalis, and GML. In vitro GML concentrations of 500 microg/ml were candicidal for all species tested, while a concentration of 10 microg/ml was bactericidal for G. vaginalis. Control and GML gels applied vaginally in women did not alter vaginal pH or Lactobacillus counts. Control gels reduced G. vaginalis counts but not Candida counts, whereas GML gels reduced both Candida and G. vaginalis. No adverse events were reported by participating women. GML is antimicrobial for Candida and G. vaginalis in vitro. Vaginal GML gels in women do not affect Lactobacillus negatively but significantly reduce Candida and G. vaginalis.
TI  - Comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. Thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. This study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) by quantitative culture and PCR methods. Main lactobacillus species include L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. jensenii and L. iners. METHODS: A total of 150 women attending Gynecology Outpatient Clinic of Beijing Friendship Hospital, were diagnosed as having BV because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of Amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal pH (pH > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of "clue" cells. Those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. Simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and Gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade I), intermediate (grade II), or consistent with BV (grade III). Gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using Vitek 2 Compact and PCR methods. Lactobacillus species were identified by PCR methods. Gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. RESULTS: BV was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. The majority of patients with BV had a smear assessed as grade III (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade II (9%, 4/46). The majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade I (64%, 67/104). Smears assessed as grade II were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. L. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with BV, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). L. gasseri, L. iners, and L. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of BV women, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The quantities of four lactobacillus species except L. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with BV. Our results provide support for the negative association between L. iners and L. gasseri. Although L. crispatus were existent both in healthy and BV positive women's vagina, the numbers of L. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. Smears of vaginal fluid and Gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.
TI  - In vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in Kenyan women.
AB  - Lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. We sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess H2O2 production. Vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following BV treatment. One hundred and fifty eight Lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of the 107 women. Lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). Among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against BV-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth of Bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. respectively. The lactobacilli produced supernatants with a pH range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (pH 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. There was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). Acid, bacteriocins and H2O2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. These substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.
TI  - Analysis of adherence, biofilm formation and cytotoxicity suggests a greater virulence potential of Gardnerella vaginalis relative to other bacterial-vaginosis-associated anaerobes.
AB  - Worldwide, bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder in women  of childbearing age. BV is characterized by a dramatic shift in the vaginal microflora, involving a relative decrease in lactobacilli, and a proliferation of anaerobes. In most cases of BV, the predominant bacterial species found is Gardnerella vaginalis. However, pure cultures of G. vaginalis do not always result in BV, and asymptomatic women are sometimes colonized with low numbers of G. vaginalis. Thus, there is controversy about whether G. vaginalis is an opportunistic pathogen and the causative agent of many cases of BV, or whether BV is a polymicrobial condition caused by the collective effects of an altered microbial flora. Recent studies of the biofilm-forming potential and cytotoxic activity of G. vaginalis have renewed interest in the virulence potential of this organism. In an effort to tease apart the aetiology of this disorder, we utilized in vitro assays to compare three virulence properties of G. vaginalis relative to other BV-associated anaerobes. We designed a viable assay to analyse bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells, we compared biofilm-producing capacities, and we assessed cytotoxic activity. Of the BV-associated anaerobes tested, only G. vaginalis demonstrated all three virulence properties combined. This study suggests that G. vaginalis is more virulent than other BV-associated anaerobes, and that many of the bacterial species frequently isolated from BV may be relatively avirulent opportunists that colonize the vagina after G. vaginalis has initiated an infection.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: a cause of infertility?
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common disorder of the genital tract in women characterized by an alteration of the normal acidic lactobacilli-predominant vaginal ecosystem to a vaginal environment dominated by Gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma species and anaerobes, with an increase in pH. The present study evaluated whether BV is associated with reproductive complications in women. BV was screened with a Gram stain of vaginal smear and interpretation was done using the Nugent score. Wet mount and polymerase chain reaction were used to screen other infections. Among 510 enrolled women, 72 (14.1%) had BV. Statistical analysis between the BV negative and positive population revealed a significant association (P = 0.0001) with infertility. In pregnant women, the infection rate was low (P = 0.01). Multiple infections such as Candida, Chlamydia and human papilloma virus were observed in 4.2%, 15.3% and 8.3% of BV-infected women, respectively. Results suggest that BV infection is associated with infertility and its absence leads to pregnancy, emphasizing its screening and treatment.
TI  - Inflammatory events as detected in cervical smears and squamous intraepithelial lesions.
AB  - The Dutch cytological coding system, KOPAC, enables to code for eight inflammatory events, that is koilocytosis (related to human papillomavirus (HPV)), Trichomonas, dysbacteriosis [related to bacterial vaginosis (BV)], Candida, Gardnerella, Actinomyces, Chlamydia, and non-specific inflammation (leucocytosis). This study presents an analysis of 1,008,879 smears. Of each smear, the age of the woman and the reason for smear taking (screening or indication) was available. The cytoscores (per mille) for these codes were calculated. For the screening smears, the cytoscores were for koilocytosis (HPV) 2.6, for Trichomonas vaginalis 1.9, for dysbacteriosis 31.4, for Candida albicans 9.8, for Gardnerella vaginalis 0.7, for Actinomyces 6.9, for Chlamydia 0.8, and for non-specific inflammatory changes 66.4. For the calculation of the Odds Ratio (OR), normal smears were used as a reference. The cytoscores for Chlamydia and Gardnerella covaried with high grade SIL (HSIL), with an OR of 7 and 12, respectively. In addition, the OR for Trichomonas vaginalis, for dysbacteriosis, and for leucocytosis proved to be significantly high in the indication smears. This study provides an oversight of HSIL and the full range of cervical infections as detected by cytology, proving that this infectious byproduct of screening can be very valuable.
TI  - Multiplex detection of bacteria associated with normal microbiota and with bacterial vaginosis in vaginal swabs by use of oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a recurrent condition that is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases, preterm births, and pelvic inflammatory disease. In contrast to the Lactobacillus-dominated normal vaginal microbiota, BV is characterized by a lack of lactobacilli and an abundance of anaerobic and gram-negative organisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. To date, the laboratory diagnosis of BV has relied upon the fulfillment of criteria determined by microscopic observation of Gram-stained vaginal swabs. We describe a molecular-based method for the easy determination of the species profile within the vaginal microbiota based on the amplification of the chaperonin-60 genes of all bacteria present in the swab and hybridization of the amplicon to species-specific oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads that are identified by flow cytometry with a Luminex instrument. We designed a nineplex Luminex array for characterization of the vaginal microbiota and applied it to the analysis of vaginal swabs from individuals from Africa and North America. Using the presence of A. vaginae or G. vaginalis, or both, as the defining criterion for BV, we found that the method was highly specific and sensitive for the diagnosis of BV using microscopy as a gold standard.
TI  - Gardnerella infection as distinguished from cervical dysbacteriosis: the advantageous spin-off of cervical screening.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cytologic diagnoses of dysbacteriosis and Gardnerella infection and to obtain insight into the diagnostic problems of Gardnerella. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred randomly selected samples of each of 3 diagnostic series were rescreened by 2 pathologists, resulting in 2 rescreening diagnoses and a consensus diagnosis. A smear was considered unequivocal when the original O code and the O code of the consensus diagnoses were equal and discordant when the flora diagnoses of the 2 pathologists differed. RESULTS: Discordance was highest in the dysbacteriotic series (20%) and lowest in the healthy group (4%). Unequivocal diagnoses were established in 65% of the dysbacteriotic smears, 80% of the Gardnerella smears and 93% of the healthy smears. Misclassification of Gardnerella occurred in the presence of clusters of bacteria mixed with spermatozoa. CONCLUSION: Blue mountain cells in Gardnerella infection can be identified unequivocally in cervical smears. Because of the clinical importance of treating Gardnerella, such advantageous spin-offs of cervical screening should be exploited.
TI  - Changes in genital anatomy and microbiology in girls between age 6 and age 12 years: a longitudinal study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study changes in genital anatomy and occurrence of human papillomavirus and Gardnerella vaginalis in girls resulting from growth and development. DESIGN: At age 11-12 years, an invitation was sent to 180 girls to attend a follow-up examination. All girls had previously participated in a study exploring anogenital anatomy and microbiology in children selected for non-abuse at age 5 and 6. The genital area was examined with a colposcope and microbiological samples for Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) were collected. GV was identified by conventional criteria and HPV by a PCR method. RESULTS: Thirty-one girls were examined twice, at mean age 5.7 and 12.0 years. At first examination all were pre-pubertal. At second examination 21 girls were B2/P2 or above. Significantly more girls had developed a structure called a fossa groove. A thick and redundant hymen with a tendency of folding outward was more common at the second examination. Two girls had GV and one girl had HPV-16 identified. Another girl was classified to have a deep notch and a probable transection in her hymen, and this girl reported a painful insertion of a tampon. All girls denied sexual activity. CONCLUSION: The main genital finding in girls entering puberty is the hymen becoming thick and redundant with a tendency of folding out. In the study findings associated with sexual activity were discovered in two girls, and the possibility of alternative explanations is discussed.
TI  - Colonization of Gardnerella vaginalis in semen of infertile men: prevalence, influence on sperm characteristics, relationship with leukocyte concentration and clinical significance.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in semen from infertile men and their negative effects on semen quality. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 24/108 infertile men (22.2%) and negative in controls. Infected semen showed no significant difference compared with non-infected semen. On the other hand, infected and non-infected semen presented significant differences in vitality, rapid and total progressive motility, normal head and mid-piece defects (p < 0.01) and combined anomalies (p < 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively) in comparison with the control group. Infected semen also presented significant differences in severely amorphous (p = 0.02) and tapered sperm (p < 0.01). Bacteriospermia and cells with attached bacteria (clue cells morphotype) were remarkable features observed. CONCLUSION: G. vaginalis in semen is not associated with either abnormal sperm characteristics or inflammatory response in infected men.
TI  - In vitro activity of secnidazole against Atopobium vaginae, an anaerobic pathogen involved in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial syndrome. The most important marker for bacterial vaginosis is the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. In this study, the in vitro susceptibilities to metronidazole and secnidazole of 16 strains of A. vaginae were tested with the agar dilution method. We observed an MIC range for metronidazole of 4-64 mg/L (MIC(50), 8 mg/L; MIC(90), 32 mg/L) and an MIC range for secnidazole of 4-128 mg/L (MIC(50), 16 mg/L; MIC(90), 64 mg/L). According to these findings, we can conclude that the activity of secnidazole is similar to that of metronidazole.
TI  - Vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis due to Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is a facultative anaerobic Gram-variable pleomorphic rod that forms part of the normal vaginal flora. It is most commonly associated with infection of the genital tract in women, but recognition of extravaginal G. vaginalis infection is becoming more frequent. We describe an unusual case of G. vaginalis vertebral osteomyelitis and discitis in a 38-year-old woman with no apparent predisposing factors.
TI  - Comparison of oral and vaginal metronidazole for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: impact on fastidious bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition that is associated with preterm birth and acquisition of complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include several fastidious species. Treatment of BV in pregnancy has mixed effects on the risk of preterm delivery, which some hypothesize is due to variable antibiotic efficacy for the fastidious bacteria. Both oral and intravaginal metronidazole can be used to treat bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, but little is known about the impact of different routes of antibiotic administration on concentrations of fastidious vaginal bacteria. METHODS: This was a sub-study of a larger randomized trial of oral versus vaginal metronidazole for treatment of BV in pregnancy. Fifty-three women were evaluated, including 30 women who received oral metronidazole and 23 who received intravaginal metronidazole. Bacterial taxon-specific quantitative PCR assays were used to measure concentrations of bacterial vaginosis associated bacterium (BVAB) 1, 2, and 3, Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium species, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Megasphaera species, and Lactobacillus crispatus before and after antibiotic treatment. RESULTS: Concentrations of Leptotrichia and Sneathia spp. and the fastidious Clostridia-like bacterium designated BVAB1 decreased significantly with oral (p = .002, p = .02) but not vaginal therapy (p = .141, p = .126). The fastidious bacterium BVAB3 did not significantly decrease with either treatment. Concentrations of Atopobium spp., reportedly resistant to metronidazole in vitro, dropped significantly with oral (p = .002) and vaginal (p = .001) treatment. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of change in bacterial concentrations between oral and vaginal treatment arms for any of the bacterial species. Lactobacillus crispatus concentrations did not change. CONCLUSION: Both oral and vaginal metronidazole therapy in pregnant women result in a significant decrease in concentrations of most BV-associated anaerobic bacteria, with the exception that Leptotrichia, Sneathia and BVAB1 do not significantly decrease with vaginal metronidazole therapy. These data suggest that the route of antibiotic administration has a minor impact on bacterial eradication in pregnant women with BV. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00153517.
TI  - Microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. Yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. The primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. Secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. RESULTS: Based on Gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (BV) microflora and that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous Gram-negative and Gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. Candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. On average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. The species most often found were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus anginosus group spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp., Mobiluncus curtisii and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. There was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. There was however a highly significant correlation between the presence of E. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). Respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with M. curtisii, Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis primer sets. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. It reveals a mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a BV microflora.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: an overview for 2009.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis has been appreciated as a unique clinical entity for well over 50 years. Its essential manifestations are well established: a loss of the normal bacterial population of the vagina and their replacement by other species. Investigations into this condition have led to a better understanding of its prevalence and epidemiology. Microbiologic and biochemical studies have exposed the remarkably complex pathophysiologic events that occur with bacterial vaginosis. Several major morbidities accompany this condition. Advances have been made in treatment, including the recent availability of a new therapeutic agent, tinidazole. However, the root cause of the condition is elusive, and as a result managing bacterial vaginosis and its complications is unsatisfactory; moreover, data suggest that therapy now is less successful than in the past. This article brings together the current fund of knowledge about bacterial vaginosis in a way that offers clinicians a realistic view of our capabilities and concerns.
TI  - Oleate lipase activity in Gardnerella vaginalis and reconsideration of existing biotype schemes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gardnerella vaginalis is a facultative gram positive organism that requires subculture every 1-2 days to maintain viability. It has been linked with bacterial vaginosis (BV), a syndrome that has been associated with increased risk for preterm delivery, pelvic inflammatory disease and HIV acquisition. About 10% of the G. vaginalis isolates have been reported to produce sialidase, but there have not been any studies relating sialidase production and biotype. Sialidase activity is dramatically increased in the vaginal fluid of women with BV and bacterial sialidases have been shown to increase the infectivity of HIV in vitro. There are 8 different biotypes of G. vaginalis. Biotypes 1-4 produce lipase and were reported to be associated with BV and the association of these biotypes with BV is under dispute. Other studies have demonstrated that G. vaginalis biotype 1 can stimulate HIV-1 production. Because of the discrepancies in the literature we compared the methods used to biotype G. vaginalis and investigated the relationship of biotype and sialidase production. RESULTS: A new medium for maintenance of Gardnerella vaginalis which allows survival for longer than one week is described. Some isolates only grew well under anaerobic conditions. Sialidase producing isolates were observed in 5 of the 6 biotypes tested. Using 4-methylumbelliferyl-oleate to determine lipase activity, instead of egg yolk agar, resulted in erroneous biotypes and does not provide reliable results. CONCLUSION: Previous studies associating G. vaginalis biotype with bacterial vaginosis were methodologically flawed, suggesting there is not an association of G. vaginalis biotypes and bacterial vaginosis. Sialidase activity was observed in 5 of the 8 biotypes.
TI  - Antibody-based detection and inhibition of vaginolysin, the Gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection worldwide and is associated with significant adverse sequelae. We have recently characterized vaginolysin (VLY), the human-specific cytotoxin produced by Gardnerella vaginalis and believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of BV and its associated morbidities. We hypothesize that novel antibody-based strategies may be useful for detection of VLY and for inhibition of its toxic effects on human cells. Using purified toxin as an immunogen, we generated polyclonal rabbit immune serum (IS) against VLY. A western blot of G. vaginalis lysate was probed with IS and a single band (57 kD) identified. Immunofluorescence techniques using IS detected VLY production by G. vaginalis. In addition, we have developed a sandwich ELISA assay capable of VLY quantification at ng/ml concentrations in the supernatant of growing G. vaginalis. To investigate the potential inhibitory role of IS on VLY-mediated cell lysis, we exposed human erythrocytes to VLY or VLY pretreated with IS and determined the percent hemolysis. Pretreatment with IS resulted in a significant reduction in VLY-mediated lysis. Similarly, both human cervical carcinoma cells and vaginal epithelial cells exhibited reduced cytolysis following exposure to VLY with IS compared to VLY alone. These results confirm that antibody-based techniques are an effective means of VLY detection. Furthermore, VLY antiserum functions as an inhibitor of VLY-CD59 interaction, mitigating cell lysis. These strategies may have a potential role in the diagnosis and treatment of BV.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of 14 genital microorganisms in urine by use of a multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot assay.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely Trichomonas vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma parvum, U. urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and HSV2, N. meningitidis, Mycoplasma hominis, M. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. The method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. The limits of detection for the mPCR/RLB assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic DNA. There were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. This method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with and without urethritis attending two Sydney sexual health clinics. One or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. Of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mPCR/RLB and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific PCR), 9 were positive only by mPCR/RLB, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. The mPCR/RLB method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.
TI  - Evaluation of common organisms causing vaginal discharge.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal discharge is very common problem among females. Alteration in balance of normal vaginal organisms can cause the overgrowth of the bacteria that creates vaginal discharge. It is common among sexually active women yet there still remain gaps in our knowledge of this infectious disorder. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of bacterial vaginosis (BV), vaginal candidiasis (VC), vaginal trichomoniasis and Group B streptococcus in women complaining of vaginal discharge in our setup. METHOD: A total of 100 women of reproductive age group with the complaint of vaginal discharge were included in the study. After filling proforma patients were examined by speculum examination and two high vaginal swabs (HVS) were collected aseptically from each patient. One swab was used for making wet mount for clue cells, pus cells and for motility of Trichomonas vaginalis. The other swab was used to check pH and Amine test. The growth was confirmed by Gram staining in each case. RESULTS: Gardnerrella vaginalis were isolated in 28%, Group B streptococcus in 5% and T. vaginolis in 4% of women. CONCLUSION: Gardnerella vaginalis causing BV is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age group in our setup.
TI  - Retinal vasculitis associated with asymptomatic Gardnerella vaginalis infection:  a new clinical entity.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report on 3 cases of retinal vasculitis associated with asymptomatic  Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) infection. METHODS: Review of 3 consecutive patients who presented with central retinal vasculitis without signs or symptoms of systemic disease. The vasculitis involved the central branches of the retinal vessels bilaterally and was steroid-dependent. RESULTS: During treatment, patients developed clinically significant vaginitis, which the gynecologist considered to be exacerbated by the steroid treatment, leading to its withdrawal. All 3 vaginal specimens were positive for GV. Antibiotic susceptibility testing led to administration of oral ampicillin (2 g/day for 10 days), which resolved both the vaginal infection and the retinal vasculitis. CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic retinal vasculitis can be triggered by several agents. In this case series, GV was associated with retinal vasculitis, which was resolved by oral ampicillin. GV infection may be one of a number of triggers of retinal vasculitis. Appropriate treatment and full resolution of ocular inflammation requires exclusion of possible underlying infections.
TI  - Does progesterone inhibit bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by lower genital tract epithelial cells?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Progesterone (P(4)) has been clinically shown to prevent the recurrence of preterm birth. The mechanism(s) of action is unclear, but may involve modulation of the immunologic inflammatory response of the lower genital tract. We evaluated the effects of P(4) on interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by vaginal and cervical epithelial cells stimulated with bacterial species that are commonly associated with preterm birth. METHODS: Vaginal and endocervical epithelial cells were incubated with up to 10,000 ng/mL P(4) overnight and stimulated with heat-killed Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, or Ureaplasma urealyticum. Concentrations of IL-8 in conditioned medium were quantified by ELISA and viability of the cell cultures was measured by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt. RESULTS: E. coli, G. vaginalis and U. urealyticum-stimulated IL-8 production for both cell lines. P(4) inhibited basal and bacteria-stimulated IL-8 production for vaginal epithelial cells but enhanced IL-8 production by endocervical cells. P(4) reduced the number of viable cells for both cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: P(4) inhibits IL-8 production by vaginal epithelial cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, possibly by reducing the number of viable cells or by inhibiting their proliferation. Although P(4) also reduces proliferation of endocervical cells it also increases their production of IL-8.
TI  - [Septic shock caused by Gardnerella vaginalis and Peptostreptococcus species after Cesarean section].
AB  - A 41-year old multisectio patient got a life-threatening postoperative infection  with Gardnerella vaginalis and Peptostreptococcus spp. Perioperative treatment with cefuroxime and metronidazol is recommended.
TI  - Effect of sulfasalazine on basal and bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by endocervical epithelial cells.
AB  - PROBLEM: Sulfasalazine (SASP) inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear-factor  kappa B activation and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by cultured explants of placenta, amnion and choriodecidua. Bacteria-induced IL-8 production in the cervix is a potential mechanism for premature cervical ripening that may lead to preterm birth. Our objective was to determine if SASP inhibits IL-8 production by endocervical cells stimulated with bacterial pathogens associated with preterm birth. METHOD OF STUDY: Human endocervical cells were incubated with 0-1.6 mm SASP and then stimulated with Ureaplasma parvum, Escherichia coli, or Gardnerella vaginalis. Conditioned medium was then harvested and production of IL-8 was quantified by ELISA. Viability of the cells was ascertained at the end of the experiment with the MTT-assay. RESULTS: At the highest concentration tested (1.6 mm), SASP significantly inhibited IL-8 production by cultures stimulated with E. coli (P < 0.001), U. parvum (P < 0.001), and G. vaginalis (P < 0.001). Viability of the cells, however, was significantly reduced by SASP at 0.8 and 1.6 mm in both the presence and absence of bacteria for all experiments. CONCLUSION: Although high concentrations of SASP inhibit IL-8 production by cultures of endocervical cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, this effect may be because of toxicity of the antibiotic on the cells.
TI  - Validation of an immunologic diagnostic kit for infectious vaginitis by Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida spp., and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - FemPure is a kit for the rapid diagnosis of vaginitis by Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida spp., and Gardnerella vaginalis, based on aggregation of latex particles joined to specific antibodies. The validation of the method involved the parameters specificity, detection limit, robustness, clinical sensitivity, and clinical specificity. Also, samples analyzed in parallel by the validated test and other recognized tests conducted by external laboratory were included. The method was specific for the 3 infectious agents, and no cross-reaction with other microorganisms usually present in vaginal exudates. The detection limit > or =1 x 10(6) CFU/mL for Candida albicans and G. vaginalis avoids the detection of concentrations considered normal flora, whereas T. vaginalis was detected until 1 x 10(5) cells/mL. Values of clinical sensitivity > or =80% and clinical specificity > or =90% and concordance > or =90% were found between samples evaluated in parallel by different methods. Robustness showed that the test can be used in laboratories with different management systems; its simple implementation without equipment allows the use in primary health care areas.
TI  - Gene polymorphisms of Toll-like and related recognition receptors in relation to  the vaginal carriage of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae.
AB  - Host genetic factors have previously been found to act as determinants of differential susceptibility to major infectious diseases. It is less clear whether such polymorphisms may also impose on pathogen recognition in mucosal overgrowth conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, an anaerobic overgrowth condition characterised by the presence of a vaginal biofilm consisting of the Gram-positive anaerobes Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. We selected 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms pertaining to 9 genes involved with Toll-like receptor-mediated pathogen recognition and/or regulation (LBP, CD14, TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, MD2, CARD15 and SIGIRR) and assessed in a nested case-control study their putative association with bacterial vaginosis, as diagnosed by Gram staining, and with the vaginal carriage of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis, as determined by species-specific PCR, among 144 pregnant women. Carriage of G. vaginalis during early pregnancy was associated with the -1155A>G substitution in the promoter region of the MD2 gene (p=0.041). The presence of A. vaginae during the first half of the pregnancy was significantly associated with the CD14 intron 2 1342G>T (p=0.039), the TLR1 exon 4 743A>G (p=0.038), and the CARD15 exon 4 14772A>T (p=0.012) polymorphisms, and marginally significantly associated with the LBP exon13 26842C>T (p=0.056), the CD14 promoter -260C>T (p=0.052), and the TLR1 promoter -7202A>G (p=0.062) polymorphisms. However, no association between gene polymorphisms and bacterial vaginosis as such could be documented. Our data suggest that some degree of genetic susceptibility involving pathogen recognition may occur with the key bacterial vaginosis organism, A. vaginae.
TI  - Adhesion of human probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus to cervical and vaginal cells and interaction with vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The ability of a probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (Lcr35) to  adhere to cervical and vaginal cells and to affect the viability of two main vaginosis-associated pathogens, Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis, as well as Candida albicans was investigated. METHODS: Adhesion ability was determined in vitro with immortalized epithelial cells from the endocervix, ectocervix, and vagina. Coculture experiments were performed to count viable pathogens cells in the presence of Lcr35. RESULTS: Lcr35 was able to specifically and rapidly adhere to the three cell lines. In coculture assays, a decrease in pathogen cell division rate was observed as from 4 hours of incubation and bactericidal activity after a longer period of incubation, mostly with P. bivia. CONCLUSION: The ability of Lcr35 to adhere to cervicovaginal cells and its antagonist activities against vaginosis-associated pathogens suggest that this probiotic strain is a promising candidate for use in therapy.
TI  - Cervicovaginal cytological abnormalities in patients with human immunodeficiency  virus infection, in relation to disease stage, CD4 cell count and viral load.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess infections and cytologic abnormalities in cervicovaginal smears from 153 HIV-positive women and 169 HIV-negative followed up at the UFTM School of Medicine between May 1999 and May 2002. The medical records and cervicovaginal smears were reviewed and the HIV-positive group was classified according to CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy and HIV subgroups (with or without disease; with or without therapy) and compared to HIV-negative group. We conclude that the frequency of Candida sp, Trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis in cervicovaginal smear, is not different between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women, even if the HIV-group is subdivided according to CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy and HIV subgroups. The frequency of LSIL, in cervicovaginal smears, was greater in the HIV-group (17.6%) than in the HIV-negative (4.1%); there was no difference between the two groups according to frequency of HSIL (4.6% versus 1.8%), ASCUS/AGUS (7.8% versus 3.5%) and invasive carcinoma (1.3% versus 0.6%). The frequency of LSIL was greater in the HIV positive group with CD4 cell count < 350 cells/mm(3). The viral load, therapeutic regimen and HIV subgroups (HIV-positive without therapy, HIV-positive with therapy, AIDS by immunological criteria and AIDS by clinical criteria) have not shown relationship with LSIL frequency, until now.
TI  - Lactocin 160, a Bacteriocin Produced by Vaginal Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Targets  Cytoplasmic Membranes of the Vaginal Pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a commonly occurring vaginal infection that is associated with a variety of serious risks related to the reproductive health of women. Conventional antibiotic treatment for this condition is frequently ineffective because the antibiotics tend to inhibit healthy vaginal microflora along with the pathogens. Lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by healthy vaginal lactobacilli, is a promising alternative to antibiotics; this compound specifically inhibits the BV-associated vaginal pathogens such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia without affecting the healthy microflora. This study investigates the molecular mechanism of action for lactocin 160 and reveals that this compound targets the cytoplasmic membrane of G. vaginalis, causing the efflux of ATP molecules and dissipation of the proton motive force.
TI  - Changes in vaginal bacterial concentrations with intravaginal metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis as assessed by quantitative PCR.
AB  - Several fastidious bacteria have been associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) using broad-range bacterial PCR methods such as consensus sequence 16S rRNA gene PCR, but their role in BV remains poorly defined. We describe changes in vaginal bacterial concentrations following metronidazole therapy for BV. Vaginal swabs were collected from women with BV diagnosed using Amsel clinical criteria, and vaginal fluid was assessed by Gram stain to generate Nugent scores. Follow-up swabs were collected 1 month after a 5-day course of vaginal 0.75% metronidazole gel and analyzed for 24 subjects with cured BV and 24 subjects with persistent BV. Changes in bacterial concentrations were measured using eight bacterium-specific 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assays. DNA from several fastidious BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) were present at high concentrations in the vagina prior to treatment. Successful antibiotic therapy resulted in 3- to 4-log reductions in median bacterial loads of BVAB1 (P=0.02), BVAB2 (P=0.0004), BVAB3 (P=0.03), a Megasphaera-like bacterium (P<0.0001), Atopobium species (P<0.0001), Leptotrichia/Sneathia species (P=0.0002), and Gardnerella vaginalis (P<0.0001). Median posttreatment bacterial levels did not change significantly in subjects with persistent BV except for a decline in levels of BVAB3. The presence or absence of BV is reflected by vaginal concentrations of BV-associated bacteria such as BVAB1, BVAB2, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Atopobium species, Gardnerella vaginalis, and a Megasphaera-like bacterium, suggesting that these bacteria play an important role in BV pathogenesis and may be suitable markers of disease and treatment response.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis presence in sexually active women in Tuzla Canton area.
AB  - The goal of our research was to determine the presence of bacterial vaginosis in  sexually active women in Tuzla Canton area. Diagnosis determination for bacterial vaginosis was conducted on the basis of three out of four internationally accepted criteria according to Amsel and isolation and identification of Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) by standard microbiological procedures. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 20,5 % (41/200) women who asked for gynaecologist's help due to their personal discomfort, since significantly higher percentage of diagnosed bacterial vaginosis of 48,80% (41/84) was determined in women with personal discomfort typical for this disease. All relevant factors, according to available literature, for genesis of bacterial vaginosis were processed in this research. In respect to the obtained outputs, bacterial vaginosis is significantly more frequent occurrence in women who are not married, since the number of sexual partners, the time of the first sexual intercourse, the use of intrauterine contraceptive device and smoking do not cause the genesis of bacterial vaginosis. According to Nugent, an increased vaginal discharge with unpleasant odour after sexual discourse, its pH>4,5, a positive amino odour test, an occurrence of clue cells in a direct microscopic concoction of vaginal discharge and assessment of the state of vaginal flora for bacterial vaginosis are significantly more frequent occurrences in women with individual discomforts. It was proved that G. vaginalis is a dominant micro organism in 95% of women with clinical signs of vaginosis although it was isolated from vaginal discharge in 40 to 50% of healthy women. In our research, G. vaginalis was isolated in 63,41% of examined women with all signs of bacterial vaginosis, in 36,59% of examined women with one or more clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis and in 2,58% of examined women of control group without clinical signs.
TI  - Accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis compared with a DNA probe laboratory standard.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of the three most common causes of acute vulvovaginal symptoms (bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis vaginitis, and trichomoniasis vaginalis) using a traditional, standardized clinical diagnostic protocol compared with a DNA probe laboratory standard. METHODS: This prospective clinical comparative study had a sample of 535 active-duty United States military women presenting with vulvovaginal symptoms. Clinical diagnoses were made by research staff using a standardized protocol of history, physical examination including pelvic examination, determination of vaginal pH, vaginal fluid amines test, and wet-prep microscopy. Vaginal fluid samples were obtained for DNA analysis. The research clinicians were blinded to the DNA results. RESULTS: The participants described a presenting symptom of abnormal discharge (50%), itching/irritation (33%), malodor (10%), burning (4%), or others such as vulvar pain and vaginal discomfort. According to laboratory standard, there were 225 cases (42%) of bacterial vaginosis, 76 cases (14%) of candidiasis vaginitis, 8 cases (1.5%) of trichomoniasis vaginalis, 87 cases of mixed infections (16%), and 139 negative cases (26%). For each single infection, the clinical diagnosis had a sensitivity and specificity of 80.8% and 70.0% for bacterial vaginosis, 83.8% and 84.8% for candidiasis vaginitis, and 84.6% and 99.6% for trichomoniasis vaginalis when compared with the DNA probe standard. CONCLUSION: Compared with a DNA probe standard, clinical diagnosis is 81-85% sensitive and 70-99% specific for bacterial vaginosis, Candida vaginitis, and trichomoniasis. Even under research conditions that provided clinicians with sufficient time and materials to conduct a thorough and standardized clinical evaluation, the diagnosis and, therefore, subsequent treatment of these common vaginal problems remains difficult. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.
TI  - What's the treatment for bacterial vaginosis?
AB  - A 28-weeks-pregnant patient complained of vaginal irritation and a malodorous white discharge that didn't improve after she used an over-the-counter cream indicated for yeast infections. What's a more effective treatment?
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis acute hip arthritis in a renal transplant recipient.
AB  - We report the case of an acute hip septic arthritis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis in a 48-year-old woman under immunosuppressive therapy for kidney transplantation. After surgical resection of the hip and 6 weeks of combination antibiotic therapy, a total hip prosthesis was successfully implanted with no recurrence after 4 years.
TI  - Preterm labor and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria among urban women.
AB  - AIMS: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) affects millions of women, is extremely prevalent  and is frequently chronic. We recognize numerous microbiologic variations among women with BV and this variability may explain the limited effectiveness of metronidazole in curing BV and/or reducing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) among BV-positive pregnant women. We assessed the independent role of seven common BV-associated bacteria on the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) among urban pregnant women. METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted within an urban obstetrics practice at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, PA. Fifty pregnant women with documented singleton pregnancies between 25-36 weeks' gestation from February 2007 through June 2007 who presented to the Labor and Delivery Unit for evaluation of uterine contractions/preterm labor were enrolled. RESULTS: We found that high median levels of Gardnerella vaginalis and low median levels of Lactobacillus crispatus were significantly predictive of SPTB. Slightly higher levels of Megasphaera-like species were also found among the group of women experiencing a SPTB during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Further identification of the individual attributable risk for separate BV-associated bacteria may be most useful in developing successful treatments to prevent SPTB among BV positive women.
TI  - Utility of reflexive semen cultures for detecting bacterial infections in patients with infertility and leukocytospermia.
AB  - This study evaluated the benefit of reflexive semen cultures in peroxidase-positive samples drawn from 17,142 consecutive samples analyzed, in which 4.7% (807/17,142) had leukocytospermia and 12.7% of those (103/807) grew significant bacterial colonies on culture. Considering the potential ramifications of the use of samples with bacteriospermia, we conclude that reflexive culture results are cost-effective and prudent.
TI  - Longitudinal trajectory of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to characterize the course of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and to discern the bacterial morphotypes responsible for infection. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal secretions were obtained in each trimester of pregnancy and were evaluated for bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain, categorized as normal or any of the following: Lactobacillus deficient, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, or Mobiluncus positive and by Nugent score. Results were evaluated for trends of bacterial vaginosis and Gram stain over pregnancy. RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight women were evaluated. Seventy-one women (48%) were bacterial vaginosis negative in all trimesters, compared with 14 (9.4%) who were positive throughout pregnancy. Among the 14 women who remained bacterial vaginosis positive, Gram stain findings were Gardnerella+Bacteroides+Lactobacillus, with approximately 50% harboring Mobiluncus. Few women become bacterial vaginosis positive as pregnancy progressed (6.1%). With each increasing week of pregnancy, the risk of becoming bacterial vaginosis positive decreased (0.93: 0.91-0.95; P < .001). CONCLUSION: In this population, the majority of pregnant women trend toward bacterial vaginosis negative status. Few women are bacterial vaginosis positive across their pregnancy.
TI  - Spermicidal activity of the safe natural antimicrobial peptide subtilosin.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition affecting millions of women each year, is primarily caused by the gram-variable organism Gardnerella vaginalis. A number of organisms associated with BV cases have been reported to develop multidrug resistance, leading to the need for alternative therapies. Previously, we reported the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin has proven antimicrobial activity against G. vaginalis, but not against the tested healthy vaginal microbiota of lactobacilli. After conducting tissue sensitivity assays using an ectocervical tissue model, we determined that human cells remained viable after prolonged exposures to partially-purified subtilosin, indicating the compound is safe for human use. Subtilosin was shown to eliminate the motility and forward progression of human spermatozoa in a dose-dependent manner, and can therefore be considered a general spermicidal agent. These results suggest subtilosin would be a valuable component in topical personal care products aimed at contraception and BV prophylaxis and treatment.
TI  - Prevotella bivia as a source of lipopolysaccharide in the vagina.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare vaginal lipopolysaccharides (LPS) concentrations between patients with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV), to evaluate the correlation between Prevotella bivia colonization density and LPS concentration, and to determine the impact of LPS on loss of dopamine neurons (DA). METHODS: Vaginal washes obtained from patients with (n=43) and without (n=59) BV were tested for quantity of P. bivia cells using quantitative PCR and for concentrations of LPS using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate gel clot method. Prevotella bivia, Gardnerella vaginalis and Escherichia coli sonicated cell extracts were also tested for LPS production. DA neuron cells obtained from embryonic day (E) 14.5 pregnant rats were exposed to fluid from eight vaginal washes; tyrosine hydrolase immunoreactive staining was applied for visualization and cell counts. RESULTS: The median LPS concentrations were dramatically higher among patients who had symptoms of BV compared to those who did not have symptoms (3235.0 vs 46.4 EU/ml, respectively, P<0.001); patients who had BV also had much higher colonization densities of P. bivia (0.06+/-0.36 vs 5.4+/-2.2 log(10) CFU/ml, respectively, P<0.001). Prevotella bivia cell lysates resulted in a higher LPS concentration (10,713.0+/-306.6 EU/ml) than either E. coli (4679.0+/-585.3 EU/ml) or G. vaginalis (0.07+/-0.01 EU/ml of LPS). The loss of DA neuron was 20-27% in cultures treated with vaginal washes from BV-negative patients and 58-97% in cultures treated with vaginal washes from patients with BV. CONCLUSION: P. bivia produces high LPS concentration, which may create a toxic vaginal environment that damages DA neurons.
TI  - Importance of isolation and biotypization of Gardnerella vaginalis in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The natural habitat of Gardnerella vaginalis is a vagina since it could be located among 69% of women who have no signs of vaginal infection and in the vagina of as many as 13.5% girls. G. vaginalis is almost certainly identified among women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis as well as in the urethra of their sexual partner. The increase in prevalence and concentration of G. vaginalis among patients diagnosed with this syndrome confirms that G. vaginalis plays a significant role in its pathogenesis. In our research, based on Amsel criteria for three or more clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis, it was diagnosed in 20.5% of women with subjective problems of vaginal infection, and in 48.80% of women with subjective symptoms characteristic of this disease. G. vaginalis was isolated from vaginal secretion of women without clinical signs characteristic of bacterial vaginosis. In 2.58% of cases it was solitary, while in 1.28% it was found in combination with other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and, in 1.28% women combined with Candida albicans. The isolation of G. vaginalis was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the group of women with clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis in comparison to the group of women without these signs. Frequent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis, which is found in 20-30% of women within a three months treatment, is explained as reinfection with other biotype of G. vaginalis, different from a source biotype or as a consequence of wrong treatment. Following Piot biotype scheme, biotypes 2., 3. and 7. G. vaginalis are significantly more often isolated from women who suffer from bacterial vaginosis. Biotype 7. G. vaginalis, isolated from the group of women without clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis, accounted for 2.58% cases. Following Benit biotype scheme, biotypes IVa, IVc and IIc were identified in 12.90% cases, while biotypes IIIa, IIa, Ia, IVb, IIb were found in 6.45% cases. Lipase-positive isolates of G. vaginalis were significantly more frequently accompanied by the syndrome of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in male sexual partners of women with and without bacterial vaginosis.

TI  - Quantitative variations in the vaginal bacterial population associated with asymptomatic infections: a real-time polymerase chain reaction study.
AB  - The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) quantification of several vaginal bacterial groups in healthy women and patients developing asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV) and candidiasis (CA) was performed. Statistical analysis revealed that the BV condition is characterised by a great variability among subjects and that it is associated with a significant increase of Prevotella, Atopobium, Veillonella and Gardnerella vaginalis, and a drop in Lactobacillus. On the contrary, the vaginal microflora of healthy women and patients developing CA was found to be homogeneous and stable over time.

TI  - Efficacy and tolerance of metronidazole and miconazole nitrate in treatment of vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a vaginal pessary containing 750 mg of metronidazole and 200 mg of miconazole nitrate used daily for 7 days in the treatment of vaginitis. METHODS: Ninety-two women with vaginitis participated in this phase 3 study using one vaginal pessary daily for 7 days. Gynecological and microbiological evaluations were carried out prior to and following treatment. RESULTS: Reductions occurred in symptoms and signs of vaginitis. Clinical cure rate was 87.7%, while the cure rates according to microscopy and Candida albicans culture were 81.8% and 73.9%, respectively. The cure rate for bacterial vaginosis was 75% and culture of Gardnerella vaginalis turned negative in 63.6% of cases following treatment. The medication was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Use of a combination of 750 mg of metronidazole and 200 mg of miconazole in a single daily application was found to be effective in the treatment of the most common causes of vaginitis.
TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - Cytologically diagnosed Gardnerella vaginalis infection and cervical (pre)neoplasia as established in population-based cervical screening.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cervical inflammation has been proposed as a cofactor in the development of cervical cancer. The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence of cervical (pre)neoplastic changes in asymptomatic women with a cytologically diagnosed Gardnerella vaginalis infection. STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from 800,498 Dutch asymptomatic women, participating in the Dutch national screening program. Prevalences of (pre)neoplasia were calculated for G vaginalis smears using a healthy flora as reference. RESULTS: The prevalence of G vaginalis infection was 0.6 per thousand. The odds ratio for (pre)neoplasia was significantly higher in smears with G vaginalis infection compared with smears of women with a healthy vaginal flora (odds ratio, 10.3; 95% confidence interval, 6.6-16.1). CONCLUSION: Cytologically diagnosed G vaginalis smears show a strong covariation with the presence of cervical (pre)neoplasia. Future research should therefore focus on the exact causal relation between cytologic G vaginalis infection and the presence of (pre)neoplastic changes of the cervix.
TI  - Molecular quantification of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. METHODS: Molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by Gram stain-based Nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for BV; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. A quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 BV-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. The targeted microorganisms were Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus species, Mobiluncus curtisii, Mobiluncus mulieris, and Candida albicans (which can be identified by Gram staining), as well as Atopobium vaginae, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by Gram staining). RESULTS: With use of the Nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as BV, and 44 were classified as intermediate. Except for U. urealyticum, M. mulieris, and Lactobacillus species, DNA of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating BV, but the predictive value of such detection was low. The molecular quantification of A. vaginae (DNA level, > or = 10(8) copies/mL) and G. vaginalis (DNA level, > or = 10(9) copies/mL) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of BV, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a BV profile. When applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Frequency of infectious agents for vaginitis in patients with a cytological diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the presence of infectious agents for vaginitis in patients with ASCUS. METHODS: 33,388 patients who underwent cervical-vaginal cytology from 08/1993 to 05/2002 were included in the study, and 1,104 (3.4%) presented positive ASCUS. The appraised infectious agents were Coccobacilli, Candida sp, Trichomonas vaginalis, and clue cells (Gardnerella vaginalis). RESULTS: In the group with ASCUS a larger frequency of Coccobacilli (22.37%) and Trichomonas vaginalis (5.25%) was found when compared with the group with negative ASCUS (17.79% and 3.98%, respectively; p < 0.05). Cytolysis occurred more frequently in patients with ASCUS (3.8 vs 6.3%, first phase and 4.5 vs 10%, second phase). CONCLUSIONS: We believe that some diagnoses of ASCUS can be induced by the presence of infectious agents for vaginitis, mainly cocci and coccoides. ASCUS occurs more frequently in the first phase of the menstrual cycle, therefore in less acid vaginal pH.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of Gardnerella vaginalis in recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Fifty strains of Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from 321 high vaginal swabs over  a period of five months were tested for their antibiotic sensitivity. Sixty eight per cent of all isolates were resistant to metronidazole while 76% were sensitive to clindamycin. All the strains isolated from cases with recurrence of infection were resistant to metronidazole. Clindamycin therapy has a better clinical efficacy than metronidazole in cases of recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus sp in liquid-based cervical samples in healthy and disturbed vaginal flora using cultivation-independent methods.
AB  - Our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (LBC) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. And to use PCR technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish DNA patterns of the 16S RNA genes of the bacteria in the sample. Thirty samples were randomly selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(BoonFix)." PCR was used to amplify DNA of five bacterial species: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis. The LBC slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. DNA of lactobacilli was detected in all cell samples. Seventeen smears showed colonization with Gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul BoonFix sample). Two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high DNA values for Gardnerella vaginalis and low values for Lactobacillus crispatus. The sample with the highest concentration for Gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal Gardnerella infection. This study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative PCR analysis. This cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal Gardnerella infection.
TI  - Atopobium vaginae triggers an innate immune response in an in vitro model of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder among women of reproductive age. The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis is poorly understood, but is defined by a transition in the vaginal flora from the predominant Lactobacillus species to other bacterial species such as Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis. This change is associated with an increase in vaginal cytokine secretion. We hypothesize that vaginal epithelial cells respond to bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria by triggering an innate immune response. We observed that vaginal epithelial cells secreted interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in response to Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis, but not to Lactobacillus crispatus. Atopobium vaginae induced increased levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 transcripts, as well as increased transcripts for the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin 4. This innate immune response required live bacteria capable of protein synthesis in direct contact with vaginal epithelial cells. The response of vaginal epithelial cells was mediated by Toll-like receptor 2, required the adaptor protein MyD88, and involved activation of the NFkappaB signaling pathway. These results suggest that Atopobium vaginae stimulates an innate immune response from vaginal epithelial cells, leading to localized cytokine and defensin production, and possibly contributes to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - The polymicrobial hypothesis of bacterial vaginosis causation: a reassessment.
AB  - The cause of bacterial vaginosis remains controversial. The two leading hypotheses are that Gardnerella vaginalis is the specific aetiologic agent versus the polymicrobial hypothesis that G. vaginalis acts in concert with other bacteria, principally anaerobes, to produce the disease. Here we reassess the prevailing polymicrobial hypothesis, finding it conceptually problematical. No host initiating factors as postulated have been identified, nor is there conclusive evidence that G. vaginalis lacks diagnostic specificity for the disease. The polymicrobial hypothesis, presupposing a unique disruption of vaginal microecology, is inconsistent with the epidemiological profile of the syndrome, which is that of a sexually transmitted disease. The epidemiological and clinical similarities between bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis suggest a similar pathogenetic process; i.e., primary causation by a specific agent, with secondary anaerobic activation and resultant amine production.
TI  - The lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, SLPI- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (CDH).
AB  - In the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. Also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique (CDH) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (Bacteroides ureolyticus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella disiens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Atopobium vaginae, Lactobacillus iners, Staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Streptococcus agalactiae). The bacterial species found by either culture or CDH were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. Grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (BV) as based on Gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable counts of lactobacilli (L. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. In BV, particularly the high concentrations of Actinomyces urogenitalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Peptoniphilus harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). The total viable counts correlated with both cervical IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. A strong negative correlation was observed between L. iners and total viable counts, G. vaginalis, or cervical IL-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with SLPI. Analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by CDH showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by CDH compared to culture. By this method, A. vaginae correlated with G. vaginalis, and L. iners with S. aureus. With regard to cytokines, B. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal IL-1 alpha as well as with cervical IL-8, while F. nucleatum, S. agalactiae, S. anginosus, or S. aureus correlated with vaginal IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, all Gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by CDH, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal SLPI. The significance of the results is discussed. In summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. CDH appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.
TI  - Functional and phylogenetic characterization of Vaginolysin, the human-specific cytolysin from Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Pore-forming toxins are essential to the virulence of a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria. Gardnerella vaginalis is a bacterial species associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and its significant adverse sequelae, including preterm birth and acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus. G. vaginalis makes a protein toxin that generates host immune responses and has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of BV. We demonstrate that G. vaginalis produces a toxin (vaginolysin [VLY]) that is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) family, most closely related to intermedilysin from Streptococcus intermedius. Consistent with this predicted relationship, VLY lyses target cells in a species-specific manner, dependent upon the complement regulatory molecule CD59. In addition to causing erythrocyte lysis, VLY activates the conserved epithelial p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and induces interleukin-8 production by human epithelial cells. Transfection of human CD59 into nonsusceptible cells renders them sensitive to VLY-mediated lysis. In addition, a single amino acid substitution in the VLY undecapeptide [VLY(P480W)] generates a toxoid that does not form pores, and introduction of the analogous proline residue into another CDC, pneumolysin, significantly decreases its cytolytic activity. Further investigation of the mechanism of action of VLY may improve understanding of the functions of the CDC family as well as diagnosis and therapy for BV.
TI  - A retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private Greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. Through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. This study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in Greece. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "Lito" Private Obstetric/Gynecological Hospital, Athens, Greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During this period, 1632 women were examined. The mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. Three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. Of the isolates, in which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were Gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) Candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) Trichomonas vaginalis. Less usual isolates were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus saprophyticus. CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in Greece. Ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic Greek women included Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.
TI  - [Protease and phospholipase activities of Candida albicans isolated from vaginal  secretions with different pH values].
AB  - Even though vulvovaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis are seldom simultaneously found, we have detected this association at an above average frequency. Thus, we set out to study the activity of proteinases and phospholipases, virulence factors of Candida albicans, to assess their role in the above mentioned association. Of a total of 70 Candida isolates were retrieved from samples of vaginal secretions analyzed at our Diagnostic Service, 65 were identified as C. albicans (a group of n=26 obtained from clinical samples of pH>4.5 and a group of n=39 from clinical samples of pH=or<4.5). The evaluation of phospholipases activity was performed on malt agar and Sabouraud dextrose agar with the addition of egg yolk as substrate. The proteolytic activity was detected on plates of agar base medium with the addition of bovine albumin serum as substrate as sole nitrogen source. Phospholipases activity was essentially the same in both groups of samples (p=0.2003). Proteolytic activity was detected in 61.5% of the isolates from the group with pH=or<4.5 and in 96.2% in the group with pH>4.5; being the former much higher than the latter (p=0.0001). Based on these results we postulate that the simultaneous occurrence of bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis could be related to the proteolytic activity but unrelated to phospholipases activity.

TI  - Placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in Latvia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (RTI) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. METHODS: In a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis (GDS) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). At delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta was studied. RESULTS: Some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had RTI or endogenous vaginal flora. Placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract colonisation with G. vaginalis (p =0.013), BV (p =0.031), S. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). BV and BV-related G. vaginalis correlated with the presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. Genital tract colonisation with GDS and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. Mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other RTIs (p =0.023). CONCLUSION: Histological placental inflammation is associated with both BV and genital tract colonisation with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.
TI  - Vaginal IL-8 levels are positively associated with Candida albicans and inversely with lactobacilli in HIV-infected women.
AB  - IL-8/CXCL8 is induced during infections, but has not been reported for Candida albicans colonization of the female genital tract. Cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples were collected from 406 HIV-infected women. IL-8 levels were evaluated by ELISA and compared with levels of C. albicans detected by potassium hydroxide (KOH) and PCR. Levels of lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis were also determined by PCR. IL-8 was significantly higher in samples from women with Candida, and regression analysis showed a positive association between IL-8 and Candida. In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between lactobacilli and IL-8. G. vaginalis and M. hominis were not significantly associated with IL-8. This study has shown an association between C. albicans and levels of IL-8 in mucosal genital fluid.
TI  - NATURAL ANTIMICROBIALS AND THEIR ROLE IN VAGINAL HEALTH: A SHORT REVIEW.
AB  - Lactobacillus species maintain the vaginal ecosystem in a healthy condition by production of antimicrobial substances. Depletion of lactobacilli in the vagina results in bacterial vaginosis (BV), where the normal flora is replaced by several bacterial pathogens, usually Gardnerella vaginalis and obligate anaerobes. BV may cause complications such as premature labor, low birth weight and increased risk of HIV acquisition. The currently recommended antibiotic treatments for BV are not always effective and often lead to reoccurrence of the infection. In many cases, this is due to the antibiotic-resistant forms of the pathogens. Therefore, there is an interest in the development of treatments using antimicrobials derived primarily from Lactobacillus spp., such as ribosomally produced antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) and lactic acid. These substances effectively inhibit pathogenic bacteria, are safe and do not pose any threat to healthy vaginal Lactobacillus spp. It may be possible to find an effective treatment against BV while reducing the infection's reoccurrence and the treatment-related complications through hurdle technology. This would be achieved by combining antimicrobials produced by Lactobacillus spp. with different natural antimicrobials obtained from plants or other non-pathogenic organisms.
TI  - The human vaginal bacterial biota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The bacterial biota of the human vagina can have a profound impact on the health  of women and their neonates. Changes in the vaginal microbiota have been associated with several adverse health outcomes including premature birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of HIV infection. Cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided new insights regarding bacterial diversity in this important niche, particularly in women with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (BV). PCR methods have shown that women with BV have complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include many fastidious species, particularly from the phyla Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Healthy women are mostly colonized with lactobacilli such as Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus iners, though a variety of other bacteria may be present. The microbiology of BV is heterogeneous. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae coating the vaginal epithelium in some subjects with BV suggests that biofilms may contribute to this condition.
TI  - Quantitative determination by real-time PCR of four vaginal Lactobacillus species, Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between L. gasseri and L. iners.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. Here we applied existing real-time PCR formats for Lactobacillus crispatus, L. gasseri and Gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for Atopobium vaginae, L. iners and L. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years. RESULTS: The 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the Ison and Hay criteria, as refined by Verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade Ia: 8 samples, grade Iab: 10, grade Ib: 13, grade I-like: 10, grade II: 11, grade III: 12 and grade IV: 7.L. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent Lactobacillus species detected. A significantly lower concentration of L. crispatus was found in grades II (p < 0.0001) and III (p = 0.002) compared to grade I. L. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade Iab than in grade Ia (p = 0.024). A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade III, with log10 median concentrations (log10 MC), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. Twenty (38.5%) of the 52 G. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for A. vaginae. In grade II we found almost no L. iners (log10 MC: 0/ml) but a high concentration of L. gasseri (log10 MC: 8.7/ml). By contrast, in grade III we found a high concentration of L. iners (log10 MC: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of L. gasseri (log10 MC: 0/ml). These results show a negative association between L. gasseri and L. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between L. gasseri and A. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In our study we found a clear negative association between L. iners and L. gasseri and between A. vaginae and L. gasseri. Our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade II is an intermediate stage between grades I and III, because L. gasseri, abundant in grade II is not predominant in grade III, whereas L. iners, abundant in grade III is present only in low numbers in grade II samples.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia in a previously healthy man: case report and characterization of the isolate.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis in women causes vaginitis or infections in other sites, such as the urinary tract, but is an infrequent cause of bacteremia. Bacteremia in men is very rare and is typically associated with immunocompromised states. Here we describe G. vaginalis bacteremia in a previously healthy man with renal calculi and urosepsis.
TI  - An adherent Gardnerella vaginalis biofilm persists on the vaginal epithelium after standard therapy with oral metronidazole.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of standard treatment with oral metronidazole in the eradication of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted an interventional follow-up study in which 18 patients with bacterial vaginosis were treated with oral metronidazole during 1 week and subsequently had a single random follow-up assessment at 1-week intervals, up to 5 weeks, with 3 patients representing each point in time. Follow-up assessment included conventional scoring of the vaginal microflora and determination of bacterial biofilm characteristics on a vaginal biopsy through bacterial 16/23S recombinant DNA-based fluorescence in-situ hybridization. RESULTS: Although all patients recovered, we consistently observed the resurgence with treatment cessation of a dense and active bacterial biofilm on the vaginal mucosa, primarily consisting of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. CONCLUSION: A large reservoir of the core bacteria to bacterial vaginosis persists as a biofilm after metronidazole treatment.
TI  - Isolation of the Bacillus subtilis antimicrobial peptide subtilosin from the dairy product-derived Bacillus amyloliquefaciens.
AB  - AIMS: To purify and characterize an antimicrobial protein (bacteriocin) isolated  from the dairy product-derived Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. METHODS AND RESULTS: An unknown bacterial species cultured from the Yogu Farm probiotic dairy beverage was identified through 16S ribosomal RNA analysis as B. amyloliquefaciens, a phylogenetically close relative of Bacillus subtilis. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) of overnight cultures was active against Listeria monocytogenes and also against clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis and Streptococcus agalactiae. At the same time, several isolates of vaginal probiotic Lactobacilli were resistant to the CFS. The nature of the compound causing inhibitory activity was confirmed as proteinaceous by enzymatic digestion. The protein was isolated using ammonium sulfate precipitation, and further purified via column chromatography. PCR analysis was conducted to determine relatedness to other bacteriocins produced by Bacillus spp. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial protein isolated from B. amyloliquefaciens was shown to be subtilosin, a bacteriocin previously reported as produced only by B. subtilis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report of intra-species horizontal gene transfer for subtilosin and the first fully characterized bacteriocin isolated from B. amyloliquefaciens. Finally, this is the first report on subtilosin's activity against bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens.
TI  - [Streptococcus group B--association with Aerobic vaginitis and ability to human cell lines activation].
AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate: the frequency of aerobic vaginitis, susceptibility of the GBS isolated from vagina of non-pregnant women with and without cervicitis to selected antibiotics and chemotherapeutics and the proinflammatory cytokines production by HeLa, THP-I, U - 937 cells after stimulation by vaginal GBS. Our results indicated low frequency of the aerobic vaginitis -4.5% among non-pregnant young women and ability of the vaginal GBS to release proinflammatory cytokines by human cell lines in vitro.
TI  - Rapid detection of Atopobium vaginae and association with organisms implicated in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Atopobium vaginae, a fastidious, anaerobic, Gram-positive cocci-shaped bacterium  that generates large quantities of lactic acid, is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Published nucleic acid amplification tests for identifying A. vaginae are directed toward the 16S ribosomal DNA with suboptimal specificity and require isolation of the organism. Here, sequencing of an A. vaginae genomic library has led to the development of a highly specific and sensitive real-time PCR test for detection of A. vaginae directly from gynecological cervicovaginal swab samples. The real-time PCR did not cross-react with DNA extracted from other members of the Atopobium genus, species with closely related 16S ribosomal DNA, and a panel of 51 other human pathogens. The DNA extraction and PCR assembly were amenable to automation using Corbett Robotics X-tractor Gene and CAS-4200N liquid handling systems. The real-time PCR was used to analyze 96 cervicovaginal swab samples submitted to our clinical laboratory for detection of organisms associated with BV. Of those samples, 28 were positive for A. vaginae. Of the 28 positive samples, 23 were concomitant with Gardnerella vaginalis detection. These results suggest that further clinical study of the relationship of A. vaginae with G. vaginalis and the development of BV should be performed.
TI  - Clinical trial of interconceptional antibiotics to prevent preterm birth: subgroup analyses and possible adverse antibiotic-microbial interaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore whether endometrial microbial colonization and plasma cell endometritis are risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, and whether these outcomes are influenced by interactions between interconceptional antibiotics and the micro-flora. STUDY DESIGN: Subgroup analyses of data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a course of metronidazole plus azithromycin given every 4 months to women with a prior preterm delivery to prevent recurrent preterm delivery. Endometrial cultures and histology were obtained at randomization and repeated 2 weeks after the first treatment. Fifty-nine on antibiotics versus 65 on placebo had pregnancy outcomes. Prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (pregnancy loss or preterm birth < 37 weeks) was stratified by treatment group and endometrial characteristics. Subgroups were assessed and screened for potential interaction (P values for significance set a priori at < .01), prior to formal statistical testing for interaction (P values < .05). RESULTS: The prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcome was 62.7% in the presence of endometrial microbial colonization at baseline (any microbe) and 50% in the absence of colonization (RR = 1.25; 99% CI 0.42-3.7). Prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes was 61.9% with plasma cell endometritis, and 70.8% without; RR = 0.87 (0.50-1.5). There was a nonsignificant reduction in adverse pregnancy outcome in the absence of Gardnerella vaginalis or gram-negative rods with RR (95% CI) = 0.60 (0.3-1.2) and 0.66 (0.4-1.2), respectively. In the presence of these microbes, antibiotics appeared to increase adverse outcomes: RR = 1.5 (1.1-2.0) and 1.5 (1.1-2.1), respectively. This reversal of impact represents a crossover interaction. CONCLUSION: Neither baseline endometrial microbial colonization nor plasma cell endometritis were risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome. However, colonization with specific microbes interacted with antibiotics to increase adverse outcomes.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  Gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. Gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. The aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. METHODS: Data were collected from 1996 to 2006. Medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range 1-16, SD 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. SPSS software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. Sexually transmitted diseases were documented: Gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), Chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), Syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), Trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and HIV 0 (0%, 27 tested). Bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): Gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), Enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), Haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), Streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), Streptococcus Group B 8 (6.6%), Staphylococcus Koag neg. 37 (30.6%), Staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), Bacteroides 19 (15.7%), Prevotella 24 (19.8%), Klebsiella 4 (3.3%), Corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and Ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Sexually transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. Bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms (except for Bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.
TI  - Symptomatic candidiasis: Using self sampled vaginal smears to establish the presence of Candida, lactobacilli, and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - In a prospective cohort study, 10 symptomatic women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis were taught how to prepare vaginal smears of their own vaginal fluids on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. The 40 smears were stained with the PAS-method and examined by three different cytopathologists for presence of Candida. Thereafter, the smears were restained with Giemsa-stain to determine presence of lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis ("clue cells") and neutrophils. All three cytopathologists unequivocally established Candida blastospores and (pseudo)hyphae in 27 out of the 40 PAS-stained vaginal smears, whereas in the remaining 13 smears Candida was not found. All 10 patients had Candida in their smears during the second half of their menstrual cycle.Self sampled smears prove to be reliable for establishing the presence of Candida in symptomatic patients with candidiasis. Candida is associated with a lactobacillus-predominated vaginal flora, but with the absence of Gardnerella vaginalis. Further studies may be directed towards the interaction between the various members of the vaginal flora. This study should open molecular methodology for determining the possible interactions of lactobacilli and Candida.
TI  - [Vulvovaginitis: vaginal pH changes and associated microflora].
AB  - PURPOSE: To establish a correlation between pH vaginal and the microflora associated in carriers of vulvovaginites. METHODS: In the present study, the cytopathological examination and the vaginal flow in a group of 65 sexually active women had been carried through, 20 and 72 years, taken care of in the Laboratorio de Citologia Clinica do Departamento de Analises Clinicas e Toxicologicas da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, for determination of microorganisms in cervicovaginal sample and of pH in the vaginal flow. RESULTS: Associating pH vaginal with the presence of vulvovaginitis, it was evidenced that the Candida sp. occurred more frequently in pH 4.0, Trichomonas vaginalis in pH 6.0, Gardnerella vaginalis in pH 5.0, coconuts in pH 5.0, bacilli in pH 4.0 and cocos/bacilos in pH 6.0. It was observed that all the patients had presented at least one type of ethiological agent of vulvovaginiti and an associated microflora. CONCLUSION: The joint accomplishment of the cytological examinations and the determination of pH revealed important for directing the microflora associated with the vulvovaginiti, suggesting, of this form, that pH vaginal plays preponderant role how much to the presence of the infectious agents in the vaginal ecosystem.
TI  - Effect of biofilm phenotype on resistance of Gardnerella vaginalis to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder worldwide. Certain lactobacilli produce H2O2 and lactic acid, which normally suppress growth of anaerobes; however, in bacterial vaginosis, Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes proliferate, and the number of lactobacilli decreases. G. vaginalis colonizes the vaginal epithelium as a biofilm, which likely plays a role in colonization and relapsing infection. STUDY DESIGN: We developed an in vitro model for G. vaginalis biofilm formation and compared susceptibilities of biofilms vs planktonic cultures to H2O2 and lactic acid. The structure and composition of the biofilm matrix were studied in order to design a method for biofilm dissolution. RESULTS: Biofilms tolerated 5-fold and 4-8 fold higher concentrations of H2O2 and lactic acid (respectively) than planktonic cultures. Proteolytic dissolution of biofilms reduced sensitivity to H2O2 and lactic acid. CONCLUSION: Increased tolerance to H2O2 and lactic acid suggests that biofilm formation contributes to the survival of G. vaginalis in the presence of lactobacilli.
TI  - Targeted PCR for detection of vaginal bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Several novel bacterial species have been detected in subjects with bacterial vaginosis (BV) by using broad-range PCR assays, but this approach is insensitive for detecting minority species. We developed a series of taxon-directed 16S rRNA gene PCR assays for more sensitive detection of key vaginal bacteria. We sought to determine the prevalence of each species in the vagina, its association with BV, and the utility of PCR for the microbiological diagnosis of BV. Targeted PCR assays were developed for 17 vaginal bacterial species and applied to 264 vaginal-fluid samples from 81 subjects with and 183 subjects without BV. The results were compared to those of two widely accepted methods for diagnosing BV, the use of clinical findings (Amsel criteria) and the interpretation of vaginal-fluid Gram stains (Nugent criteria). Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Atopobium vaginae, an Eggerthella-like bacterium, Megasphaera species, and three novel bacteria in the order Clostridiales are among the bacterial species significantly associated with BV. PCR detection of either a Megasphaera species or one of the Clostridiales bacteria yielded a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 89% for diagnosis of BV compared to the Amsel clinical criteria and a sensitivity of 95.9% and a specificity of 93.7% compared to the Nugent criteria (Gram stain). PCR detection of one or more fastidious bacterial species is a more reliable indicator of BV than detection of bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, previously linked to BV, highlighting the potential of PCR for the diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (BV). There seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of BV. Many studies have suggested that the presence of H2O2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against BV, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. In-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce H2O2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing BV. Clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of L. acidophilus or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of BV (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to Amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of BV, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. However, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of BV and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. Thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of BV are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.
TI  - Alloscardovia omnicolens gen. nov., sp. nov., from human clinical samples.
AB  - The taxonomic position of 12 isolates tentatively assigned to the genus Bifidobacterium on the basis of a limited phenotypic characterization was examined. The isolates were collected between 1978 and 2005 in Belgium, Sweden and Norway, and originated from various human clinical samples, including urine, blood, urethra, oral cavity, tonsil, and abscesses of lung and aortic valve. On the basis of band number and clustering analysis, repetitive DNA element-based PCR fingerprinting using the BOXA1R and (GTG)(5) primers indicated that the clinical isolates represented a taxon probably not belonging to the genus Bifidobacterium. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities revealed that the isolates were most closely affiliated to Parascardovia denticolens LMG 18312(T) (93.0-93.2 %), Scardovia inopinata LMG 18313(T) (92.9-93.1 %) and other members of the Bifidobacteriaceae, indicating that the isolates belong to a novel genus within that family. This observation was further substantiated by the results of partial sequencing of the heat-shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) and determination of the DNA G+C contents (47.3-48.3 mol%). Members of the novel taxon can be phenotypically distinguished from S. inopinata, P. denticolens and Gardnerella vaginalis by the ability to grow on agar under aerobic conditions and on the basis of positive reactions for acid production from L-arabinose, raffinose, salicin and D-xylose. Unambiguous phenotypic differentiation from Aeriscardovia aeriphila and Bifidobacterium species may be difficult, so phenotypic analyses should be complemented by molecular methods. The values for DNA-DNA binding among four members of the novel genus were in the range of 89-100 %, indicating that the strains should be considered as a single novel species of a novel genus, for which the name Alloscardovia omnicolens gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Alloscardovia omnicolens is CCUG 31649(T) (=LMG 23792(T)).
TI  - [The bacterial vaginosis--treatment problems].
AB  - The changes in vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of H2O2 producing Lactobacillus spp. and increasing number of Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp.) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Bacterial vaginosis is associated with infectious complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and increasing risk of STI. The preventive role of natural vaginal microflora and problems of BV treatment are discussed in the light of the recent publications.
TI  - [Conjunctivitis due to Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  
TI  - Altered expression of adhesion molecules in inflammatory cervical smears.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of pan-cadherin and beta-catenin in cervical smears with various types of infectious agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cervical smears obtained from 53 women, aged 21-65 years, with a diagnosis of specific inflammation were examined in our study. Eighteen subjects were infected by Candida albicans, 18 by Gardnerella vaginalis, nine by Bacteroides spp. and eight by Chlamydia trachomatis. All infectious agents found in the smears were at the same time confirmed by the microbiological laboratory methods. We performed a biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase immunocytochemical method using anti-beta-catenin (Clone 12F7) and anti-pan-cadherin (pan, polyclonal) antibodies. RESULTS: Aberrant expression of pan-cadherin was found in the cytoplasmic membrane of glandular, metaplastic, superficial and intermediate squamous cells in all types of infections. With regard to beta-catenin, this was expressed in majority (90%) of glandular and metaplastic cells in all types of infections and in a small proportion (15%) of superficial and intermediate squamous cells in infections caused by C. albicans and G. vaginalis. CONCLUSION: Our data show that infectious agents may cause alterations in the expression and distribution of these adhesive molecules, which can be recognized in cervical smears. Additional studies in larger sets of patients should help clarify this issue further.
TI  - [Frequency of Gardnerella vaginalis in vaginal smears of hysterectomized women].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work intended to evaluate the frequency of Gardnerella vaginallis in cervicalvaginal smears of hysterectomized women when compared to smears of non-hysterectomized women. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in the laboratory of pathology of the Western Sao Paulo University - Unoeste and 39,447 cervical/vaginal cytology reports were reviewed. Of these, 1934 women were totally hysterectomized and 37,513 were non-hysterectomized. Only data from Gardnerella vaginalis patients were collected (n=755) among the non-hysterectomized patients. RESULTS: There was a predominance of Lactobacillus species (60% of the cases) in the vaginal microbiota of hysterectomized patients with an incidence of Gardnerella vaginalis in 7.08% of the cases with a prevalence among the 41 to 50 year old age group (38 %). Among non-hysterectomized patients, 755 (2 %) had Gardnerella vaginalis and most patients were under 40 years of age (62%). CONCLUSION: Hysterectomized women are more than 3.71 times more likely to have Gardnerella vaginalis. Gardnerella vaginalis predominated in the 41 to 50 year old age group of hysterectomized women, and in the group of non-hysterectomized women with less than 40 years of age. Maintenance of the vaginal pH is important to prevent Gardnerella vaginalis infections and hysterectomized patients must take preventive care against this infection.
TI  - Rapid characterization of the normal and disturbed vaginal microbiota by application of 16S rRNA gene terminal RFLP fingerprinting.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent infection in women of reproductive age associated with numerous sequelae, including preterm delivery, amniotic fluid infections and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. The vaginal microbiota in BV patients is characterized by a shift from lactobacilli to a diverse spectrum of mostly anaerobic bacteria. In this study, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used to characterize the vaginal bacterial communities from 50 women with BV and 20 healthy subjects. In the BV samples, 23 species or phylotypes from 17 genera could be identified, including Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera sp., Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis and three recently described phylotypes from the order Clostridiales. The number of detected species or phylotypes was on average 6.3 per sample (range 2-14). In contrast, in normal samples, only Lactobacillus species could be identified. In conclusion, T-RFLP provides a rapid and reliable technique to investigate the diversity of the predominant vaginal microbiota and allows differentiation of the flora of BV and healthy women. As such, T-RFLP may be helpful both in the diagnosis of BV from vaginal fluids and in a better understanding of the bacterial succession involved in the aetiology of BV.
TI  - [Biotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns of Gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - As Gardnerella vaginalis is accepted as a member of normal vaginal flora, it is one of the dominant species which has been related to bacterial vaginosis (BV). The aim of this study was to determine the isolation rate, biotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns of G.vaginalis from the vaginal swab samples of 408 women who were admitted to the outpatient clinics of Family Planning Center. Hippurate hydrolysis, lipase and beta-galactosidase tests were performed for biotyping the isolates, and agar dilution (for metronidazole) and disk diffusion (for clindamycin) tests were used for the detection of antibiotic resistance patterns. As a result, by Nugent's BV scoring protocol, 122 (29.9%), 20 (29.4%), 137 (33.6%), and 18 (4.4%) of the women were diagnosed as BV, intermediate form, normal vaginal flora (NVF) and mycotic vaginosis, respectively. The overall isolation rate of G.vaginalis was found as 23% (94/408). Of them, 56.4% (53/94) and 8.5% (8/94) were isolated from samples of BV cases and subjects with NVF, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). The biotyping results showed that the most frequently detected types were biotype 1 (44%), 5 (20%) and 4 (18%). There was no statistically significant difference between the biotype distribution of BV patients and the subjects who have NVF (p=0.687). The results of antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that 70% and 53% of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole and clindamycin, respectively. It was of interest that MIC values for metronidazole was > or =128 microg/ml in 57% of resistant strains. The data of this study has emphasized that the metronidazole resistance is very high in our population, and the large scale studies are needed to clarify the relationship between BV and G.vaginalis biotypes, which can be found in the normal vaginal flora.
TI  - [Progress in the studies of Gardnerella vaginal].
AB  - Gardnerella vaginal is one of the main pathogenic floras of female bacterial vaginosis. Sexually transmitted, it causes fallopian pregnancy, premature rupture of the foetal membrane, neonate premature delivery and other bad pregnancy outcome. Gardnerella vaginal is also involved in male urogenital tract infection. This review summarizes the recent advances in the studies of Gardnerella vaginal in such aspects as its categorization, biocharacteristics, biogrouping, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, detection, treatment and clinical significance.
TI  - The role of gene-environment interaction in predicting adverse pregnancy outcome.
AB  - This article focuses on the influence of gene-environment interaction on pregnancy outcome. In particular, we focus on those adverse outcomes related to subclinical infection and the resultant inflammation of gestational tissues. We identify genetic association studies on pregnancy-related disorders with an infectious/inflammatory etiology. All studies in this field have focused on spontaneous preterm delivery and/or preterm and premature rupture of membranes. We discuss those articles where an environmental (infectious) exposure was studied in relation to genetic variability. In these studies, infectious exposure was defined as altered vaginal flora or bacterial vaginosis (BV). Maternal genomic variations influence both tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta response to BV-related organisms (anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis in particular) in the vagina and the risk of spontaneous preterm birth. Further studies are warranted to confirm these associations, stratify disease risk, and delineate interventions for achieving population health benefits.
TI  - Impact of interconception antibiotics on the endometrial microbial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of an interconception antibiotic regimen on endometrial microbial flora and histologic type. STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of prophylactic metronidazole plus azithromycin that was given to 241 women (antibiotics, 118 women; placebo, 123 women) with a previous preterm delivery to prevent recurrent preterm delivery. Endometrial cultures and histologic types were obtained at randomization and 2 weeks after treatment. The prevalence of either the new acquisition or the resolution of individual microbes, categories of microbes, and plasma cell endometritis were compared by chi-square or Fishers' exact tests. RESULTS: Overall, antibiotics were associated with lower acquisition and higher resolution of microbes. Of women without Gardnerella at baseline, 14% of the women who received antibiotics vs 34% of the women who received placebo had positive endometrial culture for the organism after treatment (P < .05); of those women with G. vaginalis at baseline, 57% of the women who received antibiotics vs 33% of the women who received placebo (P < .05) had a negative follow-up culture. Other gram-negative rods, especially aerobes in general, manifested similar patterns. The impact on anaerobes and plasma cell endometritis was not definitive, but there was a trend toward the increased resolution of the former (77% vs 55%) and reduced acquisition of the latter (28% vs 50%). CONCLUSION: The antibiotic regimen prevented the acquisition and promoted the resolution, but not the eradication, of gram-negative rods such as G. vaginalis and the aerobic subcategory.
TI  - Modulation of vaginal immune response among pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis by Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and yeast.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to examine the influence of coinfections on  vaginal innate and adaptive immunity, and microbial enzyme activities of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). STUDY DESIGN: The population consisted of 265 singleton pregnant women in early gestation (<20 weeks) with BV (Nugent 7-10) who had vaginal fluid collected for measurement of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-8 concentrations, number of neutrophils, immunoglobulin A against Gardnerella vaginalis (anti-Gvh IgA), and activities of microbial sialidase and prolidase. RESULTS: Among women with BV, median levels of vaginal IL-1beta (4-fold, P = .005), IL-8 (4-fold, P < .001), and neutrophils (6-fold, P = .013) were greatly increased in women with T vaginalis with respect to women without any coinfection. Yeast increased the level of IL-8 (5-fold, P < .001), but not IL-1beta (P = .239) and neutrophils (P = .060). Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae had no effect on vaginal cytokines. None of the coinfections influenced vaginal anti-Gvh IgA, sialidase and prolidase activities. CONCLUSION: The strong proinflammatory cytokine induction by T. vaginalis may contribute to the observed increase in preterm birth among BV positive women coinfected with T. vaginalis treated with metronidazole.
TI  - [Causation and treatment of infectious leucorrhoea at the Cocody University Hospital (Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire)].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to determine the frequency of different bacteria causing infectious leucorrhoea and to calculate the percentage of cures after standard treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 7-month prospective descriptive study took place from October 2003 through April 2004 in the gynaecology department of Cocody University Hospital and in the department of sexually-transmitted infections of the Pasteur Institute of Cote d'Ivoire. After identification of the organism causing each case of leucorrhoea, we prescribed treatment according to a standard protocol. Vaginal samples were taken after treatment and tested to assess its success. RESULTS: The most frequent bacteria discovered, in descending order, were: Gardnerella vaginalis (47%), Candida albicans (29.4%), Chlamydia trachomatis (13.7%), Trichomonas vaginalis (6.9%), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2.9%). The overall cure rate was 87%. Treatment failure was most common for C. trachomatis (8 of 14 cases, 57.1%), N. gonorrhoeae (1 of 3 cases) and T. vaginalis (2 of 7 cases, 28.6%). Treatment was 100% effective for G. vaginalis and C. albicans. CONCLUSION: The fight against sexually-transmitted infections should be intensified, and patients and physicians cautioned about use of doubtful generic drugs.
TI  - An altered immunity hypothesis for the development of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The hypothesis is advanced that the transition from a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microflora to a microflora characteristic of bacterial vaginosis (BV), as well as development of the adverse consequences of BV in some women but not in others, are due to alterations in innate immunity. A microbial-induced inhibition of Toll-like receptor expression and/or activity may block induction of proinflammatory immunity and lead to the proliferation of atypical vaginal bacteria. A lack of 70-kDa heat-shock protein production and release in response to abnormal flora would compound this failure to activate antimicrobial immune responses. A deficit in vaginal mannose-binding lectin concentrations would further decrease the capacity for microbial killing and increase the likelihood of bacterial migration from the vagina to the upper genital tract.
TI  - Effect of Lactobacillus challenge on Gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common infectious condition in women. It is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal pH, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. Gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. Microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable G. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). They maintained these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 produced the biggest displacement of Gardnerella. This was not due to pH, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain L. reuteri RC-14, high amounts by L. crispatus 33820 and not at all by L. rhamnosus GR-1. Deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense Gardnerella biofilm pods. For the first time, a strain of L. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal Lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. It was found to disrupt Gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than L. reuteri RC-14. These studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with Gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Use of DNA hybridization test for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis in women with symptoms suggestive of infection.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate a DNA hybridization test (Affirm VPIII) as an alternative to Gram stain for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in women with clinical signs of vaginal infection. Vaginal specimens were collected from 321 symptomatic women, and analyzed for bacterial vaginosis by both Gram stain using Nugent criteria and DNA hybridization test. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the DNA hybridization test were determined using the Gram staining as the standard for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Of the 321 patients, 115 (35.8%) were Gram positive for bacterial vaginosis and 126 (39.2%) were negative. 80 patients (25.0%) demonstrated intermediate Gram staining that was also considered negative. The Affirm system detected G. vaginalis in 107 (93.0%) of 115 vaginal specimens positive for bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by Gram stain. Compared to the Gram stain, DNA hybridization test had a sensitivity of 87.7% and a specificity of 96.0%. Positive and negative predictive values of the DNA hybridization test were 93.0% and 92.7%, respectively. In conclusion, Affirm VPIII hybridization test correlated well with Gram stain and may be used as a rapid diagnostic tool to exclude bacterial vaginosis in women with genital complaints.
TI  - The International Infections in Pregnancy (IIP) study: variations in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of morphotypes in vaginal smears among pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and the distribution of associated morphotypes among asymptomatic pregnant women in different countries. STUDY DESIGN: In 8 institutions participating in the Global Network for Perinatal and Reproductive Health (www.gnprh.org) from July 1999 to September 2001, 1466 women were enrolled. Vaginal smears were Gram stained and scored with Nugent's method at a reference laboratory. The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and bacterial morphotype distributions were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 12.3% of women had bacterial vaginosis according to Nugent's criteria. Zimbabwe had the highest prevalence (24.4%) when compared with all other sites, except Myanmar (P < .05). Among bacterial vaginosis cases, 98.9% of vaginal smears had more than 30 Gardnerella/Bacteroides morphotypes present per oil immersion field. Individual centers showed significant differences in the number of Mobiluncus and lactobacillus morphotypes (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of bacterial morphotypes in vaginal smears among asymptomatic pregnant women vary significantly in populations from different countries.
TI  - Epidemiology of sexually transmitted diseases in Rio Cuarto, Argentina.
AB  - Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are a group of transmittable diseases acquired fundamentally through sexual contact. STD are a social problem resulting from demographic explosion and changes in sexual conduct, which affects teenagers and adults of all socioeconomic strata. The goal of this work was to establish the actual state of the different STD within the studied population. Samples of vaginal fluids, endocervical materials and urethral exudates taken from 2,630 patients during five years were processed. 1,341 samples tested positive to one or more of the microorganisms, 1,099 corresponding to female patients and 242 to male patients. The microorganisms found in women were: Gardnerella vaginalis (39.1%), Candida albicans (21.3%), Trichomonas vaginalis (16.8%), Chlamydia trachomatis (11.5%); Neisseria gonorrhoeae (3.4%), Mycoplasma hominis (2.6%); Ureaplasma urealyticum (4.1%) and Treponema pallidum (1.6%). Associations were: Gardnerella vaginalis with Trichomonas vaginalis (6%), Gardnerella vaginalis with Candida albicans (5.1%); Trichomonas vaginalis with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2.2%) and Gardnerella vaginalis with Chlamydia trachomatis (2.1%). In men, gonococcic urethritis represented 37.8%, non-gonococcic urethritis 55.4% and Treponema pallidum 6.8%. A decrease in syphilis, gonococcic urethritis and gonococcic cervicitis was observed, increasing the prevalence of non-gonococcic urethritis and cervicitis. This study showed that in our environment the actual tendency of STD is still high.
TI  - Treatment of urinary tract infection by Gardnerella vaginalis: a comparison of oral metronidazole versus ampicillin.
AB  - Treatment options for bacterial vaginosis are numerous, however for urinary tract infection (UTI) by Gardnerella vaginalis have been not reported. Our purpose was to compare the efficacy and treatment complications of oral metronidazole versus oral ampicillin for treatment of this condition in a prospective randomized, nonblinded study. Fifty-seven women who had symptoms of UTI and a positive culture for G. vaginalis were enrolled in the study. Only forty-five subjects were considered valuable: 25 treated with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, and 20 with oral ampicillin 2 g for 10 days. Positive culture was defined as the presence of 10(4) or 10(5) UFC/ml of G. vaginalis in pure culture in HBT media. The clinical and bacteriological cure rates were 92% and 96% respectively for metronidazole and 90% in both for ampicillin. Chi-squared analysis reveals no statistical significance between two treatments. Adverse events were common in-patients treated with metronidazole whereas relatively few side effects were experienced in-patients treated with ampicillin. Ampicillin is effective, safe and well-tolerated therapy for UTI by G. vaginalis. In contrast oral metronidazole is effective but no safe and bad-tolerated therapy for the same condition.
TI  - Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit Prevotella bivia and Gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia. Results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of G. vaginalis and P. bivia, but with differing degrees of efficacy. The treatment of G. vaginalis- and P. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial HeLa cells with L. gasseri strain KS120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (CFCS) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. The mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low pH and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the CFCSs. In addition, coculture of G. vaginalis or P. bivia with L. gasseri KS120.1 culture or KS120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto HeLa cells.
TI  - [Vaginosis in patients with antenatal foetus death].
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of bacterial vaginosis as well as of vaginal anaerobe flora (Mycoplasma Hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus curtisii) was performed in women with antenatal foetus death. Specimens from forty women with this pathology were studied. Control group consisted of 100 pregnant women of the adequate age groups and gestation periods, but with live foetus. Vaginal smears treated by the use of polymerase chain reaction method showed that in the cases of antenatal foetus death in 70% of women Lactobacillus spp. was completely absent. This bacterium was observed only in 30% of these women. In 75% of women with live foetus Lactobacillus spp. was observed, while in 25% it was not present. Increase of quantity of anaerobic vaginal flora was observed in women, where the antenatal death of foetus was diagnosed. Percentage significance of these indices in women with live foetus was comparatively lower.

TI  - Etiologic agents of cervicovaginitis in Turkish women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of microbiologic agents causing cervicovaginitis. METHODS: We conducted the study between October 2002 and December 2004 in Abant Izzet Baysal University, Duzce School of Medicine Hospital, Turkey. The samples were obtained from the posterior vaginal fornix and cervix by swabs in 828 patients. Direct microscopic examination, culture and enzyme immune assay (EIA) methods were performed in all patients for diagnosis of microbiologic agents. RESULTS: Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) were diagnosed in 254 (30.7%) patients, Candida albicans (C. albicans) in 152 (18.4%), Candida glabrata (C. glabrata) in 36 (4.3%), Candida species in 52 (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in 62 (7.5%), Streptococcus group B in 28 (3.4%), Escherichia coli (E. coli) in 42 (5.1%), Klebsiella species in 24 (2.9%), and Streptococcus group D in 8 (1%) patients in culture. Less frequent enterobacteria in 30 (3.6%) were: Pseudomonas species, Proteus species Enterobacter species, Hafnia alvei and Nonfermenter species. Neisseria gonorrheae (N. gonorrheae) was detected in one patient (0.1%) in culture. The Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) antigen was detected by EIA methods in 130 (15.7%) patients and Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis) was observed in 8 (1%) patients by direct microscopic examination. CONCLUSION: Performing the etiologic diagnosis of cervicovaginitis is necessary in order to take appropriate therapeutic and preventive measures. Therefore, we recommend G. vaginalis, C. albicans and C. trachomatis should be investigated in patients having a diagnosis of cervicovaginitis in our population, since these were detected in a considerable number of cases. Additionally, C. glabrata and T. vaginalis should be kept in mind as possible pathogens.
TI  - Reversible deficiency of antimicrobial polypeptides in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infections. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis has a much weaker association with sexually transmitted diseases. We found that vaginal lavage fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis is deficient in antimicrobial polypeptides and antimicrobial activity compared to fluid from healthy women or women with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Effective treatment normalized the concentrations of antimicrobial polypeptides in both bacterial vaginosis and in vulvovaginal candidiasis, suggesting that the abnormalities were a result of the diseases. Unlike in vulvovaginal candidiasis, the neutrophil attractant chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) was not increased in bacterial vaginosis, accounting for low concentrations of neutrophil-derived defensins in vaginal fluid. In organotypic cultures of human vaginal epithelium containing dendritic cells, treatment with Lactobacillus jensenii, a typical vaginal resident, induced the synthesis of IL-8 mRNA and the epithelial human beta-defensin-2 mRNA, but a typical bacterial vaginosis pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis, had no effect. When the two bacteria were combined, Gardnerella vaginalis did not interfere with the immunostimulatory effect of Lactobacillus jensenii. The loss of normal immunostimulatory flora in bacterial vaginosis is thus associated with a local deficiency of multiple innate immune factors, and this deficiency could predispose individuals to sexually transmitted diseases.
TI  - Selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  - Two strains of Lactobacillus crispatus (15L08 and 21L07) and one strain of Lactobacillus jensenii (5L08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of H2O2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. All three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans. Lactobacillus crispatus 15L08 was characterized as a potential H2O2 producer. A high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by L. jensenii 5L08, with a bactericidal mode of action for G. vaginalis, C. albicans and Escherichia coli. However, H2O2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of C. albicans. Simultaneous actions of H2O2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. These strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.
TI  - [Atopobium vaginae: characterization and association with pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Atopobium vaginae was described in 1999 by Rodriguez et al. It is a Gram-positive bacterium producing organic acids (lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid) as a results of glucose fermentation. It was first found in vaginal swab taken from a healthy woman using 16S rRNA analysis. A. vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis and its consequences in upper part of women reproductive organs.
TI  - Preterm birth due to maternal infection: Causative pathogens and modes of prevention.
AB  - Preterm birth represents a major problem for modern obstetrics due to its increasing frequency and the accompanying socioeconomic impact. Although several maternal characteristics related to preterm birth have been identified, the etiology in most cases remains inadequately understood. Various microorganisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of preterm birth. Microbes may reach the amniotic cavity and fetus by ascending from the vagina and cervix, by hematogenous distribution through the placenta, by migration from the abdominal cavity through the fallopian tubes, or through invasive medical procedures. Organisms commonly cultured from the amniotic cavity following preterm delivery include Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Bacteroides spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and group B hemolytic streptococci. Several trials have examined the effect of antibiotic administration to patients with preterm labor and intact membranes, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, genital mycoplasmal infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial vaginosis. The results of such studies, which were variable and often conflicting, are discussed here.
TI  - The association of Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis and recurrence after oral metronidazole therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated associations between Atopobium vaginae and bacterial  vaginosis (BV) and the role that A. vaginae plays in recurrent BV after oral metronidazole therapy. METHODS: Women with abnormal vaginal discharge or odor were enrolled in a cross-sectional study (n=358); the proportion of those infected with Gardnerella vaginalis and A. vaginae was determined by polymerase chain reaction. Women with BV (Nugent score [NS] 7-10 or 4-6 with > or =3 Amsel criteria; n=139) were treated with oral metronidazole (400 mg twice a day for 7 days) and examined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months or until they reached an NS of 7-10 and recurrence of A. vaginae and G. vaginalis infection was established. RESULTS: A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were highly sensitive for BV--96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 91%-98%) and 99% (95% CI, 97%-100%), respectively. However, A. vaginalis was more specific for BV (77% [95% CI, 71%-82%]) than was G. vaginalis (35% [95% CI, 29%-42%]). G. vaginalis was detected in 100% and A. vaginae in 75% of women with recurrent BV; higher organism loads were present in women with recurrent BV. A. vaginae was rarely detected without G. vaginalis, and women in whom both organisms were detected had higher rates of recurrent BV (83%) than women infected with G. vaginalis only (38%) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Infection with A. vaginae is more specific for BV than infection with G. vaginalis. The higher recurrence rates in women in whom both A. vaginae and G. vaginalis were detected suggest that A. vaginae makes a significant contribution to BV. However, its etiological role remains unclear.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus helveticus strain KS300 against  diarrhoeagenic, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study was to investigate in vitro the antibacterial activity of the Lactobacillus helveticus strain KS300 against vaginosis-associated bacteria including Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia, uropathogenic Escherichia coli, and diarrhoeagenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. METHODS AND RESULTS: The KS300 strain inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis, P. bivia, S. typhimurium, and pathogenic E. coli. After direct co-culture, data show that the Lactobacillus strain decreased the viability of G. vaginalis, P. bivia, S. typhimurium, and pathogenic E. coli. The adhering KS300 strain inhibited the adhesion of G. vaginalis DSM 4944 and uropathogenic Dr-positive E. coli IH11128 onto HeLa cells. Moreover, the KS300 strain inhibited the internalization of uropathogenic Dr-positive E. coli IH11128 within HeLa cells and S. typhimurium SL1344 within Caco-2/TC7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate that L. helveticus strain KS300 is adhesive onto cultured human cells and has antagonistic activities against vaginosis-associated, uropathogenic and diarrhoeagenic pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Adhering L. helveticus strain KS300 is a potential probiotic strain displaying a strain-specific array of in vitro antibacterial activities.
TI  - Clinical characteristics of vaginal discharge in bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by Nugent's criteria.
AB  - PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: To determine which clinical signs have an important contribution in bacterial vaginosis (BV) diagnosed by Nugent's criteria. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 58 women undergoing vaginal examination at Hayashi women's clinic, Hyogo Prefecture. Characteristics of vaginal discharge (color, amount, odor, and pH level) and the number of clue cells were compared among normal, intermediate, and BV groups. BV was diagnosed by using Nugent's criteria. RESULTS: The incidence of BV in our study population was 25.9%. Compared to the non-BV group, women in the BV group were found more often to have yellowish color and a moderate amount of discharge (66.67% vs 33.33%, NS; 55.56% vs 44.44%, NS), odorous discharge (100% vs 0%, p < 0.05) and furthermore, pH level and the number of clue cells were significantly higher. CONCLUSION: Odor, pH level and the number of clue cells in the vaginal discharge were helpful clinical signs for early detection of BV diagnosed by Nugent's criteria.
TI  - [Sialidase activity in women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (VB) is a syndrome characterized by overgrowth of endogenous  Gram negative bacterial flora and the lack of the normal flora. Within bacterial enzymes, sialidases have been considered a virulence factor of many pathogenic microorganisms colonizing the different mucous membranes. Their presence in vaginal discharges can be correlated with VB. The aim of this study was to detect the activity of this enzyme in women with this syndrome and without clinical evidence of genital infection. Out of a total 112 women studied, 51 were patients with VB and the other 61 women presented normal vaginal flora. For the quantification of enzyme activity, the technique based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of a derivative acid of the acetyl metoxifenil muramic acid was used. In the studied population both groups shared values from 0.5 to 5.1 nmoles of metoxifenol, whereas only 11 out of 52 patients with VB (21.17%), registered more than 5.1 nmoles. The presence of sialidase activity is not enough to confirm VB, except for values greater than 5.5 nmoles of the metoxifenol produced in the enzymatic reaction.
TI  - Prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. From vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. Then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. These six strains were found to belong to three distinct species: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. jensenii and L. vaginalis. One strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. These three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (FOS Actilight and FOS Raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 GOS and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 GOS). The test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as Candida albicans, Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis. Oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by HPLC analysis. This revealed that two oligosaccharide series (FOS Actilight DP3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 GOS DP > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. The selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.
TI  - Variation in vaginal immune parameters and microbial hydrolytic enzymes in bacterial vaginosis positive pregnant women with and without Mobiluncus species.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess if levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8, sialidase, prolidase and immunoglobulin A against Gardenerella vaginalis hemolysin (anti-Gvh IgA) in vaginal secretions differ between BV+ women with (M+) and without (M-) Mobiluncus spp. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal secretions were obtained from 265 women at their first prenatal care visit and assessed for all study parameters. Gram stain evaluation using Nugent criteria was performed and coinfection with sexually transmitted infections determined. Differences between BV+/M+ and BV+/M- women were evaluated using the chi2 statistic or Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Of the 265 BV+ women, 43% (n = 113) were M+ of which 97% (n = 110) had Nugent scores of 9 or 10 . BV+/M+ women had elevated levels of sialidase (median value: 4.11 nmol vs 1.91 nmol of converted substrate; P = .003) but no difference in prolidase, anti-Gvh IgA, IL-1beta, IL-8, levels were found between the two groups. BV+/M- women had significantly higher rates of coinfection with Trichomonas vaginalis. CONCLUSION: BV+/M+ women have higher vaginal concentrations of sialidase and lower rates of T. vaginalis compared with BV+/M- women. Further research is needed to assess the association of this, and other, microbiologic profiles to risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.
TI  - Probiotics for women's health.
AB  - GOALS: The goals of this research were 2-fold: (1) to determine whether a commercially available probiotic mixture (VSL-3) could survive and grow in a continuous culture system simulating the vaginal environment and (2) to determine whether the probiotic mixture was capable of suppressing the growth of a known vaginal vault pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis. BACKGROUND: An abnormal vaginal microflora, such as that associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an important health issue for women. In addition, the association of this condition with preterm labor and delivery suggests that control of BV may impact the number of preterm births. Interventional trials with antibiotics have received mixed reviews and other interventional options, including the use of probiotics, are being considered. STUDY: A well-documented continuous culture system has been used to determine whether VSL-3 can survive and grow in conditions simulating a vaginal environment. In addition, the ability of VSL-3 to inhibit the growth of a known vaginal vault pathogen, G. vaginalis, has been determined. RESULTS: The probiotic mixture was shown to survive and maintain itself within the fermentation vessel of the continuous culture system over an extended period of time. This mixture, when challenged with a known pathogen, was also shown to suppress the growth of G. vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: It may be feasible to use probiotics as interventional therapy to suppress the growth of pathogens within the vaginal vault associated with BV.

TI  - Prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae in virginal women.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study was to determine the prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae in virginal women and to establish if nonpenetrative sexual activity is associated with these organisms. GOAL: The goal of this study was to assess prevalence of G. vaginalis and A. vaginae in virginal women. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-four virginal female patients self-collected tampon specimens, which were tested for G. vaginalis and A. vaginae by polymerase chain reaction, and provided either brief or detailed information regarding sexual practices by self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty women (45%) had G. vaginalis and 3 (7%) A. vaginae detected. Among the 27 who provided detailed information, 12 (46%) had G. vaginalis and none had A. vaginae detected. G. vaginalis was significantly more likely to be detected in those who had participated in oral sex (odds ratio = 22; 95% confidence interval = 2.2-222) and hand-genital contact without penetration (P = 0.02), but not genital-genital contact. CONCLUSION: This study shows that nonpenetrative intimate sexual contact is associated with carriage of G. vaginalis in virginal women.
TI  - [Prevalence of the HIV infection and five other sexually-transmitted infections among sex workers in Niamey, Niger].
AB  - We performed a systematic screening of HIV infection and five other sexually transmitted infections on a consecutive sample of 529 female sex workers from Niamey. HIV seroprevalence rate was 30.1%, with HIV-1 profile in 93.1% of the cases. For curable STI, 4.7% of women had treponematosis, 7% gonorrhoea, 16.8% Gardnerella vaginalis, 36.9% Mycoplasma hominis and 68.2% Chlamydia trachomatis infection. The percentage of women with at least one STI was significantly higher in HIV positive's: 95.6% against 87.9%. Only 7.9% of women were free of any infection.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Atopobium vaginae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, Atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of BV. METHODS: Nine strains of Atopobium vaginae, four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of Lactobacillus iners and one strain each of Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the Etest. RESULTS: All nine strains of A. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). We found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2 to more than 256 microg/ml. The four G. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. All lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). CONCLUSION: Clindamycin has higher activity against G. vaginalis and A. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all A. vaginae isolates are metronidazole resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on a more limited number of strains.
TI  - Throwing the dice for the diagnosis of vaginal complaints?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis is among the most common conditions women are seeking medical care for. Although these infections can easily be treated, the relapse rate is high. This may be due to inadequate use of the diagnostic potential. METHODS: We evaluated the misjudgement rate of the aetiology of vaginal complaints. A total of 220 vaginal samples from women with a vaginal complaint were obtained and analysed for numbers of total lactobacilli, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, total aerobic cell counts and total anaerobic cell counts including bifidobacteria, Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp. Additionally, the presence of Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida spp. and Trichomonas vaginalis was evaluated by DNA-hybridisation using the PCR and Affirm VPIII Microbial Identification Test, respectively. RESULTS: The participating physicians diagnosed Bacterial vaginosis (BV) as origin of discomfort in 80 cases, candidiasis in 109 cases and mixed infections in 8 cases. However, a present BV, defined as lack of H2O2-lactobacilli, presence of marker organisms, such as G. vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. or Atopobium vaginae, and an elevated pH were identified in only 45 cases of the women examined. Candida spp. were detected in 46 cases. Interestingly, an elevated pH corresponded solely to the presence of Atopobium vaginae, which was detected in 11 cases. CONCLUSION: Errors in the diagnosis of BV and candida vulvovaginitis (CV) were high. Interestingly, the cases of misjudgement of CV (77%) were more numerous than that of BV (61%). The use of Amsel criteria or microscopy did not reduce the number of misinterpretations. The study reveals that the misdiagnosis of vaginal complaints is rather high.
TI  - Treatment and management of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: current and future  perspectives.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis accounts for the majority of cases of vaginal discharge and has been consistently linked to an increased risk of preterm delivery. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by the reduced number or absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp., which promotes the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Bacteroides spp., and Mobiluncus spp. Black race, higher-risk sexual activity, frequent vaginal douching and the substantial reduction of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus spp. are the main predictors of bacterial vaginosis development. Clinical- and laboratory-based bacterial vaginosis diagnostic tests are widely used to screen for bacterial vaginosis but, more recently, office-based bacterial vaginosis screening tools have been developed. Although systemic treatment for bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole or clindamycin has been demonstrated to be effective in the short-term cure of bacterial vaginosis, recurrence of bacterial vaginosis within 3 months of treatment is common, and treatment for bacterial vaginosis using these strategies has not been effective in reducing the risk of preterm delivery.
TI  - Etiologies of nongonococcal urethritis: bacteria, viruses, and the association with orogenital exposure.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to determine pathogens and behaviors associated with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and the usefulness of the urethral smear in predicting the presence of pathogens. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of men with and without symptoms of NGU. Sexual practices were measured by questionnaire. First-stream urine was tested for Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Ureaplasma parvum, U. urealyticum, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, HSV-2, adenoviruses, and Gardnerella vaginalis by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: C. trachomatis (20%), M. genitalium (9%), adenoviruses (4%), and HSV-1 (2%) were more common in cases with NGU (n = 329) after age and sexual risk were adjusted for (P< or =.01); U. urealyticum, U. parvum, and G. vaginalis were not. Infection with adenoviruses or HSV-1 was associated with distinct clinical features, oral sex, and male partners, whereas infection with M. genitalium or C. trachomatis was associated with unprotected vaginal sex. Oral sex was associated with NGU in which no pathogen was detected (P < or = .001). Fewer than 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) per high-power field (HPF) on urethral smear were present in 32%, 37%, 38%, and 44% of cases with C. trachomatis, M. genitalium, adenoviruses, and HSV, respectively. CONCLUSION: We identified adenoviruses and HSV-1 as significant causes of NGU with distinct clinical and behavioral characteristics and highlighted the association between insertive oral sex and NGU. A urethral PMNL count of > or =5 PMNLs/HPF is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude pathogens in men with urethral symptoms.
TI  - Relationship of U1 cell HIV-stimulatory activity to bacterial vaginosis and HIV genital tract virus load.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) has been associated with HIV sexual transmission and increased levels of genital tract HIV RNA. We postulated that BV induces the appearance of substances in the genital tract that stimulate HIV expression locally. To test this, we measured HIV RNA levels in genital mucosal fluid from women with or without BV (defined by Nugent score) and compared them with the ability of those fluids to stimulate HIV expression in the chronically HIV-infected monocytic line U1. The U1 activity was significantly higher in women with BV (median = 1320 pg/ml p24) than in women with normal flora (median = 103 pg/ml p24, p = 0.0001). However, levels of the U1 activity were not significantly associated with levels in the genital tract of HIV RNA. Levels of the U1 activity were also not associated with levels of Gardnerella vaginalis or Mycoplasma hominis in genital fluids, suggesting these bacteria were not the source of the activity. Thus, while these data show a strong association of U1 stimulatory activity with BV, no influence of the U1 activity on genital tract HIV expression was observed.
TI  - The bacteriology of pre-labour rupture of membranes in a Nigerian teaching hospital.
AB  - A prospective case control study that was conducted at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Nigeria, between 1st January and 31st December 2002. The purpose of this study was to determine the association and the pattern of bacteria/microorganisms in the aetiology of pre-labour premature rupture of membrane (PROM) in this centre. A total of 108 cases of PROM and 98 control cases that presented between 37 completed weeks' and 40 weeks' gestation were analysed. Pathogens were isolated in 48 patients, giving a recovery rate of 44.4%. The common pathogens include Gardnerella vaginalis (29.1%), Candida (23.0%) and Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%). Others were Streps. Pyogenes (16.6%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (CONS) (6.3%) and Klebsiella (6.3%). Only Candida and S. aureus were isolated in the controls. Ofloxacin and azithromycin were 100% active against all the isolated pathogens, while ampicillin was the least active. G. vaginalis was the most sensitive among the isolates while CONS and Klebsiella were the least sensitive. It is evident in this study that some pathogens were associated with PROM and that G. vaginalis was the most common organism and azithromycin was the only antibiotic with 100% sensitivity. We suggest that metronidazole should be added to azithromycin to cover for anaerobes in cases of PROM, where facilities for screening for anaerobes are not available.

TI  - [The correlation of inflammation and epithelial changes in the Pap smears of cervix uteri].
AB  - A modification of The Bethesda System classification of cytologic findings of uterine cervix named Zagreb 1990 has been accepted in Croatia as a unique classification, the use of which has begun after the publication and printing of the new, uniform method of cytologic examination. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the number and type of cytologic abnormalities of uterine cervix classified according to Zagreb 1990, on routinely examined Pap smears during the 6-year period, and to investigate the connection of these abnormalities with lower genital tract infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective study included Pap smears from the City of Zagreb and from the town of Imotski. A total of 59901 Pap smears (patients aged 17-79) were routinely examined: the cytopathologic diagnosis of CIN I or higher recorded in 3664 (6.12%) of them. The control group consisted of 401 Pap smears of age-matched women referred by the same gynecologists and free from cytologic abnormalities. The most frequently diagnosed epithelial change was CIN 1 (84.57% of all epithelial changes, and 5.17% of total study population), followed by CIN II (10.92%; 0.67%), CIN III (3.11%; 0.19%), and invasive squamous carcinoma (1.31%; 0.08%). Endocervical adenocarcinoma was cytologically diagnosed in only 0.0055% of all Pap smears examined. Inflammation was significantly more common in the group with epithelial dysplasia/carcinoma than in the control group (p < 0.01). Of specific causative agents HPV and Chlamydia trachomatis were significantly more frequently found in the group with epithelial dysplasia/carcinoma than in the control group (p < 0.05 both), however, Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis or Candida yielded no significant differences. It is concluded that inflammation very likely contributes to the development of precancerous lesions of the cervix, HPV and Chlamydia showing strongest correlation, at least in a part of our population.
TI  - Molecular identification of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis affects millions of women and is associated with  several serious health conditions. The cause of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood despite numerous studies based on cultures. Bacteria in microbial communities can be identified without cultivation by characterizing their ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences. METHODS: We identified bacteria in samples of vaginal fluid with a combination of broad-range polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplification of 16S rDNA with clone analysis, bacterium-specific PCR assay of 16S rDNA, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed directly on vaginal fluid from 27 subjects with bacterial vaginosis and 46 without the condition. Twenty-one subjects were studied with the use of broad-range PCR of 16S rDNA, and 73 subjects were studied with the use of bacterium-specific PCR. RESULTS: Women without bacterial vaginosis had 1 to 6 vaginal bacterial species (phylotypes) in each sample (mean, 3.3), as detected by broad-range PCR of 16S rDNA, and lactobacillus species were the predominant bacteria noted (83 to 100 percent of clones). Women with bacterial vaginosis had greater bacterial diversity (P<0.001), with 9 to 17 phylotypes (mean, 12.6) detected per sample and newly recognized species present in 32 to 89 percent of clones per sample library (mean, 58 percent). Thirty-five unique bacterial species were detected in the women with bacterial vaginosis, including several species with no close cultivated relatives. Bacterium-specific PCR assays showed that several bacteria that had not been previously described were highly prevalent in subjects with bacterial vaginosis but rare in healthy controls. FISH confirmed that newly recognized bacteria detected by PCR corresponded to specific bacterial morphotypes visible in vaginal fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Women with bacterial vaginosis have complex vaginal infections with many newly recognized species, including three bacteria in the Clostridiales order that were highly specific for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  - The physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. This prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. Semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and/or U. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) CCU ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. In standard aerobic cultures, Gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and Streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). Ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered, high (> or =10(4) CCU ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) CCU ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. Of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. This study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of U. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for U. urealyticum should be raised to > or =10(4) CFU ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before any treatment.
TI  - Adherent biofilms in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis is a common infectious disorder. Although known since ancient times, little progress has occurred in identifying causal factors. Our aims were to study the bacterial community structure and the spatial organization of microbiota on the epithelial surfaces of vaginal biopsy specimens. METHODS: We investigated the composition and spatial organization of bacteria associated with the vaginal epithelium in biopsy specimens from 20 patients with bacterial vaginosis and 40 normal premenopausal and postmenopausal controls using a broad range of fluorescent bacterial group-specific rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes. RESULTS: Bacterial vaginosis was associated with greater occurrence and higher concentrations of a variety of bacterial groups. However, only Gardnerella vaginalis developed a characteristic adherent biofilm that was specific for bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSION: A biofilm comprised of confluent G vaginalis with other bacterial groups incorporated in the adherent layer is a prominent feature of bacterial vaginosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2.
TI  - Comparison between Gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade I microflora and revised categorization of grade I microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using Nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on Gram stained slides of vaginal smears. Ison and Hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the Streptococcus cell type. Because in the Nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard Gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the Gram stain. To this purpose we compared Gram stain based categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific PCR for the detection of Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae and with ii) tDNA-PCR for the identification of most cultivable species. RESULTS: A total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade I microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade II, 22 (4.3%) as grade III and 8 (1.6%) as grade IV, according to the criteria of Ison and Hay. Another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade I-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. We found that 52.7% of the grade I-like samples contained Bifidobacterium spp. while L. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and G. vaginalis and A. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade II specimens.Based on the presence of different Lactobacillus cell types, grade I specimens were further characterized as grade Ia (40.2%), grade Iab (14.9%) and grade Ib (44.9%). We found that this classification was supported by the finding that L. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade Ia and Iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade Ib specimens, a category in which L. gasseri and L. iners were predominant. CONCLUSION: Further refinement of Gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade I smears (Ia, Iab and Ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade I-like. A strong correlation was found between grade Ia and the presence of L. crispatus and between grade I-like and the presence of bifidobacteria. This refinement of Gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.
TI  - [Sexually transmitted diseases].
AB  
TI  - A preliminary survey of Atopobium vaginae in women attending the Dunedin gynaecology out-patients clinic: is the contribution of the hard-to-culture microbiota overlooked in gynaecological disorders?
AB  - Preliminary studies have indicated that the recently described bacterium Atopobium vaginae may have an association with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Fifty-five women attending the gynaecology out-patient's clinic were tested for the presence of this micro-organism, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus and Bacteroides species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. The frequency of detection was 40%. PCR detection of Gardnerella vaginalis with A. vaginae, occurred in 50% of A. vaginae-positive cases. Due to the high detection rate of A. vaginae we believe that it is important to determine whether this and other hard-to-culture microorganisms have a role in gynaecological disorders.
TI  - Use of DNA hybridization to detect vaginal pathogens associated with bacterial vaginosis among asymptomatic pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether microbial DNA hybridization is a useful method to study bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal specimens were collected at <26 weeks' gestation from 230 women, and analyzed for bacterial vaginosis by both Gram stain using Nugent criteria and DNA hybridization for Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Mobiluncus curtisii. Results were analyzed using McNemar's paired test and chi-square test for trend, with significance set at P < .05. RESULTS: By Gram stain, 60 (26.1%) of 230 were positive for bacterial vaginosis, and 134 (58.3%) were negative. By DNA hybridization, 99 (43%) were positive for at least 1 pathogen, and DNA results were significantly associated with Gram-stain results (P < .01). As the Nugent score progressed from normal to abnormal flora, the proportion with >1 pathogen detected by DNA hybridization increased significantly (P < .001). CONCLUSION: DNA hybridization may be a useful method to study shifts in vaginal flora during pregnancy.
TI  - Variation in microbiologic profiles among pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if clinical findings and sociodemographic variables among bacterial vaginosis (BV)-positive pregnant women are associated with different microbiologic profiles. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women were assessed for BV by Nugent criteria. BV+ women were separated into 6 mutually exclusive microbiologic groups. In unadjusted analyses, we compared (1) sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and (2) 3 clinical characteristics among BV+ women with and without Mobiluncus (M+ vs M-). Unadjusted data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the likelihood of having clinical signs of BV in women with and without Mobiluncus spp while controlling for confounders. RESULTS: A total of 1756 BV+ pregnant women were followed. The M+ group (n=702) was significantly more likely than the M- group (n=1054) to be non-Hispanic black (80.9% vs 66.2%; P < .0001), older than 21 years (61.7% vs 48.7%; P < .0001), and to have had more than 3 lifetime sexual partners (66.4% vs 54.9%; P < .0001). The M+ group was also more likely to have clue cells on wet mount (63.9% vs 47.2%; P < .0001) and a positive amine odor after addition of KOH (57.2% vs 45.0%; P=.001). There was no difference in other demographic variables or physician diagnosis of abnormal vaginal discharge. In the adjusted analyses for each clinical outcome, all findings were consistent with the unadjusted analyses. CONCLUSION: BV+ pregnant women with Mobiluncus spp are more likely to have clue cells present on wet mount, a positive amine odor after KOH preparation, and to be older, non-Hispanic black, and have had more lifetime sexual partners compared to BV+ women without any Mobiluncus species.
TI  - Characterization of vaginal microflora of healthy, nonpregnant women by chaperonin-60 sequence-based methods.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. STUDY DESIGN: Asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. Total genomic DNA was isolated from the vaginal swabs. Degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic DNA and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. Library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. Presence of Chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by Nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. Vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to Lactobacillus spp L. crispatus, L. iners, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, and L. buchneri. Other sequences that were identified included representatives of Gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to Porphyromonas spp and Megasphaera spp and sequences identical to C psittaci. CONCLUSION: Culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that were not previously associated with vaginal flora.
TI  - Utility of Amsel criteria, Nugent score, and quantitative PCR for Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Lactobacillus spp. for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a clinical syndrome presenting with a malodorous vaginal discharge and increased vaginal pH. Diagnosis has been based on clinical Amsel criteria and direct Gram stain of vaginal secretions. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants in the Women's Interagency HIV Study contributed cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples. Lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis in cervicovaginal lavage samples were quantified by PCR. Gynecologic evaluation included Nugent score and Amsel criterion assessment. We compared the gold standard Nugent score to Amsel criteria and quantitative bacterial PCR for diagnosing BV in 203 CVL samples from women with Nugent scores of 7 to 10 (BV group) and 203 samples from women with BV Nugent scores of 0 to 3 ("No-BV" group). Only 75 of the 203 CVL samples from women with Nugent scores of 7 to 10 met positive Amsel criteria. Increasing levels of G. vaginalis and M. hominis and decreasing levels of lactobacilli were significantly associated with BV by Nugent score. Of the group with Nugent scores of 7 to 10, 83% and 81% had log(10) G. vaginalis counts and log(10) M. hominis counts greater than 6.81 and 4.82, respectively, while only 30% and 31% of the group with Nugent scores of 0 to 3 were above these thresholds, respectively. There was significant overlap in the log(10) lactobacillus counts between the two groups. Utilizing all three log(10) bacterial counts (G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and lactobacilli) in our model improved the sensitivity and specificity to 83% and 78%, respectively, in comparison with Nugent score. In this cohort, Amsel criteria were poorly predictive of BV. PCR quantification of G. vaginalis and M. hominis from CVL is significantly more sensitive than Amsel criteria for diagnosing BV.
TI  - Microbiologic response to treatment of bacterial vaginosis with topical clindamycin or metronidazole.
AB  - To compare the frequencies, concentrations, and antimicrobial susceptibilities of vaginal microbes isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) before and after therapy, 119 nonpregnant women aged 18 to 45 with clinical and Gram stain evidence of BV were randomized to receive intravaginal clindamycin or metronidazole. Vaginal swabs were collected at baseline and 7 to 12 days, 35 to 45 days, and 70 to 90 days following therapy for quantitative vaginal culture. For the 99 women completing all four visits, statistical analyses were performed comparing differences in vaginal microflora between the two treatment arms and between visits in the same treatment group. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the agar dilution method was performed for anaerobic gram-negative rods. Although both therapies resulted in decreased colonization by Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis, only metronidazole treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency and concentration of Prevotella bivia and black-pigmented Prevotella species. Of the 865 anaerobic gram-negative rods evaluated for susceptibility, only 3 (0.3%) were resistant to metronidazole, whereas clindamycin resistance increased significantly for P. bivia and black-pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods persisting following clindamycin therapy. Clindamycin-resistant subpopulations of P. bivia and black-pigmented Prevotella species emerged 7 to 12 days after therapy even among women colonized initially by clindamycin-susceptible strains. These resistant subpopulations persisted at high frequencies (42 to 50%) 70 to 90 days following therapy. The two topical agents for treatment of BV have differing microbiologic effects on the vaginal microflora. The emergence of clindamycin-resistant anaerobic gram-negative rods following therapy is of concern.
TI  - [Significance of clue cells in the diagnosis of male urogenital infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the significance of clue cells in the diagnosis of male urogenital infection. METHODS: Urethra swabs or prostatic fluid of 264 male outpatients were collected and smeared directly on the slice to find clue cells under the ultramicroscopy. Meanwhile, the positive patients' spouses were detected for bacterial vaginosis (BV). RESULTS: The positive rates of the urethra swabs and the prostatic fluid were 5.1% (11/215 ) and 2.0% (1/49), respectively. Nine cases in 11 of the patients' spouses (81.8%) were diagnosed as BV. CONCLUSION: BV pathogen can attack and attach to the epithelia of male genitals to form clue cells. Clue cells positive, along with clinical symptoms, contribute to the diagnosis of male urogenital bacterial infection.
TI  - A cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Women (N = 1,140) were ascertained at five US centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. Serial vaginal swabs were obtained for Gram's stain and cultures. PID was defined as 1) histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees C, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. Exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. The first correlated with BV by Gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to a lesser degree, Ureaplasma urealyticum. The second, unrelated to BV by Gram's stain, consisted of Enterococcus species and Escherichia coli. Being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of BV-associated microorganisms increased PID risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). Carriage of non-BV-associated microorganisms did not increase PID risk. Women with heavy growth of BV-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). When identified by microbial culture, a combination of BV-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring PID.
TI  - Complexity of vaginal microflora as analyzed by PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in a patient with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gardnerella vaginalis has long been the most common pathogen associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). We aimed to test our hypothesis that symptoms and signs of BV do not necessarily indicate colonization by this organism, and often will not respond to standard metronidazole or clindamycin treatment. METHODS: Using a relatively new molecular tool, PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), the vaginal microflora of a woman with recalcitrant signs and symptoms of BV was investigated over a 6-week timeframe. RESULTS: The vagina was colonized by pathogenic enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Candida albicans. The detection of the yeast by PCR-DGGE is particularly novel and enhances the ability of this tool to examine the true nature of the vaginal microflora. The patient had not responded to antifungal treatment, antibiotic therapy targeted at anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens such as Gardnerella, nor daily oral probiotic intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The failure to find the GG strain in the vagina indicated it did not reach the site, and the low counts of lactobacilli demonstrated that therapy with this probiotic did not appear to influence the vaginal flora. CONCLUSIONS: BV is not well understood in terms of its causative organisms, and further studies appear warranted using non-culture, molecular methods. Only when the identities of infecting organisms are confirmed can effective therapy be devized. Such therapy may include the use of probiotic lactobacilli, but only using strains which confer a benefit on the vagina of pre- and postmenopausal women.
TI  - Multiple abscesses caused by Gardnerella vaginalis in an immunocompetent man.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis causing significant infection in men is rare. We report a case of sepsis in a previously well man, who developed a perinephric abscess and empyema. G. vaginalis was isolated after prolonged culture of samples from both sites. The microbiological features of the case are discussed.
TI  - Frequency of infectious agents for vaginitis in non- and hysterectomized women.
AB  - The frequency of infectious agents for vaginitis has shown varying results. Bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis are infections related to vaginal pH alteration. Vaginal pH is related to endocervical pH in pre- and post-menopaused women, and vaginal pH in hysterectomized women is more acidic than in non-hysterectomized women. The aim of this paper is to verify differences in Papanicolaou smear diagnoses of infectious agents in hysterectomized women. A retrospective study was conducted at Faculdade de Medicina do Triangulo Mineiro (public tertiary referral centre). A total of 1,579 Papanicolaou reports for each group (hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized) was analysed. Clue cells, Candida sp., Trichomonas vaginalis, cytolysis, coccobacilli and lactobacilli were diagnosed by cytological criteria (Papanicolaou's method), statistical methods: the chi2 test and linear regression (significance level < 0.05). Clue cells decrease with the age in both the groups and are more frequent in non-hysterectomized women with > 59 years. There is an increased frequency of Coccobacilli and a decrease of lactobacillus as the age of women increases. The frequency of T. vaginalis is not influenced by hysterectomy but there is a decreased frequency between 40 years and 49 years old. Cytolysis was more frequent in women below 40 years old and between 50 years and 59 years old in both groups (P < 0.009). Candida sp. is a less common finding between 40 years and 49 years old in both groups and more frequent in hysterectomized women with > 60 years old (P = 0.002). Our results showed that the presence of infectious agents for vaginitis in Papanicolaou findings is associated with age. The frequency of finding of Candida sp. in women above 60 years old may be influenced by hysterectomy.
TI  - Normal ocular flora in newborns delivered in two hospital centers in Argentina and Paraguay.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the spectrum of normal conjunctival flora in newborns in two hospital centers in North Argentina and Paraguay. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, conjunctival specimens were obtained from the right eyes of newborns prior to the application of any topical medications. Culture samples were also obtained from the cervicovaginal secretions of the infants' mothers. All samples were directly inoculated into culture media and all growth were identified and quantified. RESULTS: Among the 190 newborns studied, 126 were delivered vaginally and 64 via caesarean section (C-section). A total of 180 different bacterial strains were acquired from the vaginally delivered infants and 77 from the C-section group (P=0.078, Student's t-test). Conjunctival cultures obtained within one hour of birth showed that 85 out of 101 samples (84%) from both the vaginal and C-section group had positive cultures, compared to 84 out of 89 samples (94%) obtained more than 1 h after birth (P<0.001). Among the vaginally delivered newborns, the most common bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (in 69 samples, 38%), Propionibacterium spp (36, 20%) and Corynebacterium spp (29, 16%). In the CES, the most common isolates were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (39, 51%), Propionibacterium spp (22, 29%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6, 8%). There was a significantly higher proportion of gram-positive rods (P=0.017) isolated from infants delivered vaginally (16%) than from those delivered by C-section (5%). No Neisseria gonorrhoeae were isolated in conjunctival samples. Among the 130 organisms isolated from cervicovaginal secretions in 81 out of 189 mothers, the most common organisms were Lactobacillus spp. (47%), Corynebacterium spp (21%), Gardnerella vaginalis (15%), and Candida spp (14%). No Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis were found in cervicovaginal samples. CONCLUSION: The most common conjunctival bacteria in newborns delivered by either vaginal birth or C-section were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. The proportion of positive conjunctival cultures was higher for infants delivered vaginally than for C-section delivery.
TI  - Frequency and diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in women with vaginal discharge, and to compare different diagnostic tests for its diagnosis. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Aga Khan University Hospital from June 1998 to May 2000. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All women attending the Obstetrics and Gynecology clinics at The Aga Khan University Hospital, with the complaints of vaginal discharge, were examined with the help of a speculum. The vaginal pH was measured, samples for bacterial cultures were obtained. A slide was prepared for the gram's stain and Whiff-test was also performed. BV was diagnosed, when the vaginal discharge fulfilled at least three of the composite clinical criteria (Amsel's criteria), a standard method for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis: homogenous (pasty) discharge, pH more than 4.5, positive Whiff-test and the presence of clue cells. RESULTS: The frequency of BV was observed to be 16.1% . The culture for Gardnerella vaginalis was compared with the composite clinical criteria. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the culture, calculated for the diagnosis of BV were 93.8%, 70%, 37.7% and 98% respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of laboratory tests in conjunction with clinical findings is necessary for diagnosis of BV. The composite clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BV are rapid, reliable and inexpensive method.
TI  - Induction of tumor necrosis factor- alpha secretion and toll-like receptor 2 and  4 mRNA expression by genital mucosal fluids from women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with complications of pregnancy and increased susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sexual transmission. METHODS: The ability of genital mucosal fluids from women with BV and of microbial flora associated with BV to induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha secretion and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 mRNA expression was assessed. RESULTS: Primary peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and THP-1 monocytic cells secreted TNF- alpha in response to cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples from women with BV. Mycoplasma hominis and Gardnerella vaginalis also stimulated TNF- alpha secretion. Strikingly, CVL samples from women with BV induced up to 60-fold increases in TLR4 mRNA expression, compared with CVL samples from women without BV and with bacteria not associated with BV. Anti-TNF- alpha antibody blocked increases in TLR4 mRNA expression induced by CVL samples from women with BV, indicating that TNF- alpha plays a critical role in induction of TLR4. Both TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA expression were approximately 60-fold higher in cells isolated from the lumen of the genital tract than in cervical mucosal tissue, but lumen TLR mRNA levels did not change significantly after BV treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments show that genital mucosal fluids and certain bacteria from women with BV stimulate TNF- alpha secretion and TLR4 mRNA expression, suggesting mechanisms whereby BV affects pregnancy and HIV transmission.
TI  - Rifaximin, a peculiar rifamycin derivative: established and potential clinical use outside the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed semisynthetic rifamycin derivative with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, both aerobes and anaerobes. Although originally developed for the treatment of infectious diarrhea, the appreciation of the pathogenic role of gut bacteria in several organic and functional gastrointestinal diseases has increasingly broadened its clinical use. The availability of a topical formulation (a cream containing 5% of the drug) and the lack of transcutaneous absorption pointed out in both animal and human studies has allowed its topical use in skin infections. Furthermore, since the spectrum of antibacterial action of rifaximin includes many organisms (e.g. Bacteroides bivius-disiens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi) causing genital infections, including Trichomonas vaginalis and Chlamydia trachomatis, its local application in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) has been attempted. Finally, since periodontal disease, caused by plaque (an aggregate of various bacteria), can be considered a 'local' infection, intrapocket rifaximin was tried in the treatment of periodontal infections. While the efficacy in pyogenic infections of the skin has been confirmed by several investigations, which showed an improvement of both subjective and objective parameters significantly better than that of the reference drug (i.e. chlortetracycline or oxytetracycline), the usefulness of rifaximin in BV and periodontal disease needs to be further studied in well-designed clinical trials.
TI  - [Evaluation of different liquid media for the culture of Gardnerella vaginalis and characterization of the protein profile with PAGE-SDS electrophoresis].
AB  - 3 liquid culture media: triptose soya broth supplemented with equine serum (TSB-es)/without supplement (TSB) and Casman broth (CB) were evaluated under different incubation conditions at 10% of CO2 and under aerobic conditions. There were no significant differences in the values of optic density for the TSB-es and CB media. However, on establishing the protein profile by PAGE-SDS for the evaluated conditions, the presence of protein of 14 kDa and the values of optic density allowed the selection of the CB medium for the culture of Gardnerella vaginalis. The sensitivity to different pH in this medium was studied. pH 7.2 proved to be optimum and it was established its growth cynetics. The analysis by PAGE-SDS of the complete cells corresponding to different clinical isolates of G. vaginalis with biochemical variations made possible to characterize the protein profile in this medium and showed similarity between the isolates.
TI  - Propolis solution for the treatment of chronic vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of 5% propolis solution in recurrent vaginitis. METHOD: Fifty-four patients with recurrent vaginal infections having undergone at least one cycle of antibiotic treatment were instructed to apply a 5% aqueous propolis solution as a vaginal douche for seven days. Vaginal smears and specific symptoms were evaluated at baseline and 14 days after treatment. Long-term well-being was assessed by telephone interview six months after follow-up. RESULT: At the follow-up, the vaginal smears of 41 patients (75.9%) had improved. Forty-seven patients (87%) reported reliefs concerning at least one complaint. Associated improvement of smear and well-being was observed in 36 women (66.7%). After 6 months, 33 patients (61.1%) were satisfied with their condition without having undergone further treatment. CONCLUSION: Propolis may have a role as an alternative treatment for chronic vaginal infection.
TI  - Symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis in heterosexual men: a case control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine microbial and behavioural factors contributing to non-gonococcal urethral symptoms in men. METHODS: Case-control study of heterosexual men with non-gonococcal urethral symptoms (cases) and without urethral symptoms (controls) attending Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, Australia. Sexual behaviour and condom use were measured by questionnaire. First stream urine was tested for potential pathogens: Chlamydia trachomatis (ligase chain reaction), Mycoplasma genitalium (polymerase chain reaction, PCR), Ureaplasma urealyticum (culture and PCR), and Streptococcus spp, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Haemophilus species (culture). Urethral smears from cases were examined for polymorphonuclear leucocytes. RESULTS: 80 cases and 79 controls were recruited over 4 months in 2002-3. 49 cases (61%) had urethritis by microscopic criteria, 17 (21%) had Chlamydia trachomatis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 27 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.4 to 222)), five (6%) had Mycoplasma genitalium (OR 6.1 (95% CI: 0.6 to 61)), and 11 (14%) had Gardnerella vaginalis (OR 9.0 (95% CI: 1.6 to 52)). Other organisms were not significantly associated with urethral symptoms. The presence of urethritis on urethral smear did not predict the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis (OR 1.7 (95% CI: 0.5 to 5.4)). Urethral symptoms were significantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex with more than one casual partner (OR 9.3 (95% CI: 1.3 to 65)) and unprotected anal sex with a regular partner in the past month (OR 3.5 (95% CI: 1.0 to 13)). CONCLUSION: Gardnerella vaginalis and unprotected anal sex may cause symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis. Microscopy of the urethral smear to diagnose urethritis in this population does not help to identify which men with urethral symptoms require treatment for chlamydia.
TI  - Induction of secretory aspartyl proteinase of Candida albicans by HIV-1 but not HSV-2 or some other microorganisms associated with vaginal environment.
AB  - The most common type of candidiasis involves mucosal sites such as the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. Among many of virulence factors, the production of secretory aspartyl proteinase (Sap) by Candida albicans (C. albicans) has gained much attention, and factors leading to Sap induction are thus under intense study. The aim of this study was to examine whether some microorganisms such as Lactobacillus, Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis), human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) and human herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) had any Sap inducing effect on C. albicans. Here we showed that among the microorganisms tested in vitro only HIV-1 induced Sap production from C. albicans.
TI  - Vaginal flora morphotypic profiles and assessment of bacterial vaginosis in women at risk for HIV infection.
AB  - Specific morphotypic profiles of normal and abnormal vaginal flora, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), were characterized. A prospective study of 350 women yielded concurrent Gram-stain data and clinical assessment (n = 3455 visits). Microbiological profiles were constructed by Gram stain. Eight profile definitions were based on dichotomizing the levels of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and curved, Gram-negative bacillus (Mobiluncus) morphotypes. Of these, two were rare, and the other six demonstrated a graded association with the clinical components of BV. The proposed profiles from the Gram stain reflect the morphotypic categories describing vaginal flora that may enable clearer elucidation of gynecologic and obstetric outcomes in various populations.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis, vaginal flora patterns and vaginal hygiene practices in patients presenting with vaginal discharge syndrome in The Gambia, West Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) - a syndrome characterised by a shift in vaginal flora - appears to be particularly common in sub-Saharan Africa, but little is known of the pattern of vaginal flora associated with BV in Africa. We conducted a study aimed at determining the prevalence of BV and patterns of BV-associated vaginal micro-flora among women with vaginal discharge syndrome (VDS) in The Gambia, West Africa. METHODS: We enrolled 227 women with VDS from a large genito-urinary medicine clinic in Fajara, The Gambia. BV was diagnosed by the Nugent's score and Amsel's clinical criteria. Vaginal swabs were collected for T vaginalis and vaginal flora microscopy, and for Lactobacillus spp, aerobic organisms, Candida spp and BV-associated bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma spp) cultures; and cervical swabs were collected for N gonorrhoeae culture and C trachomatis PCR. Sera were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Sexual health history including details on sexual hygiene were obtained by standardised questionnaire. RESULTS: BV prevalence was 47.6% by Nugent's score and 30.8% by Amsel's clinical criteria. Lactobacillus spp were isolated in 37.8% of women, and 70% of the isolates were hydrogen-peroxide (H202)-producing strains. Prevalence of BV-associated bacteria were: G vaginalis 44.4%; Bacteroides 16.7%; Prevotella 15.2%; Peptostretococcus 1.5%; Mobiluncus 0%; other anaerobes 3.1%; and Mycoplasma hominis 21.4%. BV was positively associated with isolation of G vaginalis (odds-ratio [OR] 19.42, 95%CI 7.91 - 47.6) and anaerobes (P = 0.001 [OR] could not be calculated), but not with M hominis. BV was negatively associated with presence of Lactobacillus (OR 0.07, 95%CI 0.03 - 0.15), and H2O2-producing lactobacilli (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05 - 0.28). Presence of H2O2-producing lactobacilli was associated with significantly lower prevalence of G vaginalis, anaerobes and C trachomatis. HIV prevalence was 12.8%. Overall, there was no association between BV and HIV, and among micro-organisms associated with BV, only Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. were associated with HIV. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with any of the factors relating to sexual hygiene practices (vaginal douching, menstrual hygiene, female genital cutting). CONCLUSION: In this population, BV prevalence was higher than in corresponding populations in industrialised countries, but the pattern of vaginal micro-flora associated with BV was similar. BV or vaginal flora patterns were not associated with HIV nor with any of the vaginal hygiene characteristics.
TI  - Low-dose secnidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bacterial vaginosis could be cured with a single  1-g oral dose of secnidazole. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 80 women were recruited at the outpatient gynecologic clinic of Manuel Noriega Hospital, Maracaibo, Venezuela. Diagnosis and patient enrollment were based on the Amsel criteria. The participants were randomized to 2 groups. In group 1 (n=44) participants received a single 1-g oral dose and in group 2 (n=32) participants received a single 2-g oral dose of secnidazole. Clinical cure was defined as the absence of the characteristic symptoms (a bad odor and a grossly abnormal discharge) and at least 2 of the following: vaginal pH less than 4.5, no fish odor on addition of KOH, and no Gardnerella vaginalis or clue cells on wet-mount examination. Cytologic cure was defined as an absence of G. vaginalis on a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. RESULTS: Clinical cure was experienced by 95.5% of the women who received the 1-g oral dose and by 97.4% of the women who received the 2-g oral dose of secnidazole. There was no significant difference between the groups in the clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis. Following treatment, results were negative for G. vaginalis in 94.7% of the women. In group 1, 41 women (93.2%), and in group 2, 31 women (96.9%) had cytologic cure. The Pap smear revealed G. vaginalis in 3 of the women in group 1 and 1 of the women in group 2 (P=0.47). Twenty-seven women (35.5%) reported mild side effects. More women had adverse effects in group 1 (n=16) than in group 2 (n=11) but this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This clinical study showed that a single 1-g oral dose of secnidazole is effective to cure bacterial vaginosis associated with G. vaginalis.
TI  - [Frequency, diagnostic criteria and consequences of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women].
AB  - Vaginal discharge based on changes in a vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of Lactobacillus and increasing number of Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with: preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid infection, endometritis, low-weight neonates. The role of natural microflora of vagina, the most important diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and immunological changes in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis are discussed in the light of the recent publications.
TI  - [Study of acute vulvovaginitis in sexually active adult women, with special reference to candidosis, in patients of the Francisco J. Muniz Infectious Diseases Hospital].
AB  - The results of microbiological vaginal secretions samples obtained from 749 women (from July 2001 to July 2002) were studied in the Bacteriology Unit of the Francisco Javier Muniz Hospital from Buenos Aires. All patients suffered acute vulvovaginitis were child bearing and sexually active women, 334 of them were HIV-positive. The following are the results of the microbiological studies: Lactobacillus spp 50.6%, Gardnerella vaginalis 25.6%, Candida spp 17.4%, Trichomonas vaginalis 5.3%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.3% and B group Streptococcus 0.8%. Candida vaginitis was significantly more frequent in HIV-positive patients, (21.6% vs 14%; p = 0.0086); meanwhile, trichomoniasis was less common although the difference was not statistically significant (3.6 vs 6.7%, p = 0.0810). The following Candida species were isolated in this study: Candida albicans 76.8%, Candida glabrata 15.6%, Candida parapsilosis 2.9%, Candida tropicalis 1.5% and Candida krusei 0.7%. Eight cases (6.2%) of vaginitis were produced by two Candida species (C. albicans and C. glabrata), and in three cases (2.17%) Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated. Five women suffering acute vaginitis with Candida spp presented another etiologic agent of vaginal infection, three cases T. vaginalis and two cases G. vaginalis. The following are some of the most important findings of this study: 1) Half of the patients presented a normal microbial biota; 2) Candida spp vaginitis was significantly more frequent among HIV-positive women; 3) we observed a high incidence of Candida glabrata infections (15.9%), 4) 6.2% of vaginal candidiasis were caused by more than one Candida species and, 5) the susceptibility pattern of C. albicans and C. glabrata isolates against fluconazole was similar to the one observed in other studies. The majority of C. albicans isolates were susceptible to fluconazole (MIC90 = 0.5 microg/ml) meanwhile C. glabrata strains were much less susceptible to this drug (MIC50 and MIC90 = 32 microg/ml).
TI  - Inflammatory smears--is there a correlation between microbiology and cytology findings?
AB  - Cervical smear results reporting the presence of inflammation are regularly encountered by smeartakers, yet the significance of this finding is not clear. We wished to evaluate whether the presence of inflammation on smear test was associated with a higher incidence of lower genital tract infection. A retrospective review was carried out on women attending our colposcopy unit for their first visit during 2001. Results of 256 women were available for analysis. Evidence of inflammation was found in 9.7% of smears. Genital tract infection was found in 29.2% of women overall. Infection with more than one micro-organism was present in 8.9 percent. Forty eight percent of women having inflammatory changes on smear test had genital tract infection. This compared with 27.3% of women whose smear tests showed no evidence of inflammation. Prevalence of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida, Bacteroides and Gardnerella vaginalis was higher in the inflammatory smear group. This study shows that women with an inflammatory smear are more likely to harbour genital tract infection than women whose smear shows no evidence of inflammation. Chlamydia infection in particular has long-term fertility consequences through its potential to cause asymptomatic tubal damage: it was present in a substantial proportion of women with inflammation on smear (20%). Screening for lower genital tract infection via high vaginal swab and either intracervical swab or urinary screening for Chlamydia infection should be carried out in all women with smear tests reporting the presence of inflammation.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of antibiotic resistance in obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Antibiotic resistance of microorganisms that cause infections of the urogenital tract is a clinically relevant problem in obstetrics and gynecology. Due to methodological difficulties, resistance testing is rarely used for the management of these infections. Therefore, solid epidemiological data on resistance rates of most involved pathogens are scarce. Antibiotic resistance of several microorganisms appears to be increasing in various areas of the world, mainly Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis (metronidazole),Streptococcus agalactiae (macrolides, clindamycin), Mycoplasma hominis (tetracyclines, intrinsically macrolide resistant). In addition,isolated cases of clinical infections caused by multi-resistant Chlamydia trachomatis have been reported. The presence of antibiotic resistance should therefore be considered in patients with an unfavorable course despite adequate antibiotic therapy. In light of the growing problem of antibiotic resistance and the large gaps in our knowledge in this particular area, research efforts in the field of anti-biotic resistance in gynecological infections should be markedly intensified.
TI  - Neisseria gonorrhoea, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Treponema pallidum infection in  antenatal and gynecological patients at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana.
AB  - Five hundred and seventeen women attending the gynecology and obstetrics clinics  of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital were examined for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Vaginal swabs were examined for Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, and Gardnerella vaginalis infection. Endocervical swabs were examined for Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia trachomatis using a recently developed RNA detection kit. Strain typing was performed to identify serovars of C. trachomatis. Sera were analyzed for Treponema pallidum with a passive-particle agglutination assay kit. The prevalence of infection with N. gonorrhoea was 0.6%, C. trachomatis 3.0%, and T. pallidum 5.6%. Eight samples were PCR-positive for C. trachomatis. Five of these were serovar G, and the rest were serovar E. All cases of mixed infections occurred in pregnant women. In conclusion, a high transmissible risk of T. pallidum infection was observed among our study population and in particular among our pregnant women. The absence of association between the presenting symptoms, clinical findings, and specific pathogens has implications for the syndromic approach to STI case management. The low prevalence of C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoea may be due to self medication and requires further research in primary health institutions in rural areas to compare rates.
TI  - Management of vaginitis.
AB  - Common infectious forms of vaginitis include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Vaginitis also can occur because of atrophic changes. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by proliferation of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes. The diagnosis is based primarily on the Amsel criteria (milky discharge, pH greater than 4.5, positive whiff test, clue cells in a wet-mount preparation). The standard treatment is oral metronidazole in a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for seven days. Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be difficult to diagnose because characteristic signs and symptoms (thick, white discharge, dysuria, vulvovaginal pruritus and swelling) are not specific for the infection. Diagnosis should rely on microscopic examination of a sample from the lateral vaginal wall (10 to 20 percent potassium hydroxide preparation). Cultures are helpful in women with recurrent or complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, because species other than Candida albicans (e.g., Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis) may be present. Topical azole and oral fluconazole are equally efficacious in the management of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, but a more extensive regimen may be required for complicated infections. Trichomoniasis may cause a foul-smelling, frothy discharge and, in most affected women, vaginal inflammatory changes. Culture and DNA probe testing are useful in diagnosing the infection; examinations of wet-mount preparations have a high false-negative rate. The standard treatment for trichomoniasis is a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole. Atrophic vaginitis results from estrogen deficiency. Treatment with topical estrogen is effective.
TI  - Female genital-tract HIV load correlates inversely with Lactobacillus species but positively with bacterial vaginosis and Mycoplasma hominis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition. We examined the association between BV and BV-associated bacteria and expression of HIV in the female genital tract. METHODS: HIV RNA, lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples were quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Gynecologic evaluation included Nugent score assessment, Amsel criteria assessment, detection of other genital-tract infections, and dysplasia grading. CD4 cell count, plasma HIV RNA level, and antiretroviral history were obtained. RESULTS: A total of 203 CVL samples from women with Nugent scores of 7-10 (BV group) and 203 samples from women with Nugent scores of 0-3 (no-BV group) were matched by plasma HIV RNA level and analyzed. After controlling for plasma HIV RNA level and Nugent score in univariate analyses, we found that G. vaginalis and M. hominis bacterial counts, Candida vaginitis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) were positively associated with CVL HIV RNA levels. In multivariate analysis, only lactobacilli bacterial counts (P=.006; inverse association), M. hominis bacterial counts (P=.0001; positive association), Candida vaginitis (P=.007), and HSV (P=.03) were significantly associated with CVL HIV RNA levels. CONCLUSION: Bacteria associated with BV increase genital-tract HIV RNA levels. Quantitative bacterial counts for lactobacilli and M. hominis are better correlates of CVL HIV RNA than are Nugent score or Amsel criteria. Since plasma virus and CD4 cell levels did not differ between the BV and no-BV groups, these data suggest that the bacterial flora associated with BV influence genital-tract HIV shedding.
TI  - Evolving issues in understanding and treating bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a synergistic polymicrobial syndrome characterized by depletion of Lactobacillus spp., especially those that produce hydrogen peroxide, and an intense increase in the quantity of commensal vaginal anaerobic bacteria to 100- to 1000-fold above normal levels. While the bacterial spectrum of these organisms has long been known to include Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella spp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, Mobiluncus spp. and Mycoplasma hominis, innovative use of molecular diagnostics has identified novel species apparently associated with this syndrome, including Atopobium vaginalis. Effecting resolution of bacterial vaginosis is important, in particular for the 8 to 23% of women afflicted with symptomatic disease during their reproductive years. Bacterial vaginosis has been consistently associated with numerous adverse sequelae related to the upper genital tract, including pelvic inflammatory disease and postsurgical infection in the setting of invasive gynecologic procedures, and may increase women's risk of acquiring HIV infection. Pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis experience a higher rate of preterm delivery and low-birth-weight infants. While antibiotics with activity against anaerobes--typically, metronidazole and clindamycin applied vaginally or taken orally--are the mainstays of therapy, bacterial vaginosis frequently recurs. For these reasons, innovative approaches to therapy are urgently required.
TI  - Vaginal Immunity in Bacterial Vaginosis.
AB  - Vaginal immunity in response to microbial perturbation is still poorly understood and may be crucial for protection from adverse outcomes associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is the most prevalent vaginal disorder in adult women worldwide. However, its pathogenesis is still elusive. In BV-positive women, inflammatory signs are scant--approximately 50% of women are asymptomatic. The number of vaginal neutrophils in the BV-positive patient is not increased with respect to healthy women. In contrast, vaginal interleukin (IL)-1beta levels are largely increased. Recent findings indicate that microbial hydrolytic enzymes could be responsible for dampening the expected proinflammatory response cascade after IL-1beta increase. In other words, BV causes a large increase of vaginal IL-1beta, which is not paralleled by an increase of IL-8 levels, suggesting that BV-associated factors specifically dampen IL-8. The impairment of IL-8 increase may explain the absence of neutrophil increase in most women exposed to a massive abnormal anaerobic vaginal colonization (BV). Among BV-positive women, vaginal innate immunity is strongly correlated to a specific adaptive immune response: the immunoglobulin A (IgA) against the hemolysin produced by Gardnerella vaginalis (anti-Gvh IgA), which is the main bacterium present in BV. High anti-Gvh IgA levels are protective for adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, an exaggerated inflammatory response, mainly attributed to genetic polymorphisms, is also implicated in BV-associated adverse outcomes.
TI  - Polymorphism in intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene, local midtrimester cytokine response to vaginal flora, and subsequent preterm birth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between polymorphism in intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene, midtrimester vaginal microflora, vaginal interleukin receptor antagonist and interleukin-1beta levels and subsequent spontaneous preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal samples from 212 women, collected at 18-22 weeks' gestation, were analyzed for the polymorphism in intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene by polymerase chain reaction, qualitative and quantitative vaginal microflora, and interleukin-1beta and interleukin-1ra concentrations by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Pregnancy outcome data were subsequently obtained. RESULTS: Carriage of intron 2 of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist allele 2 (IL1RN * 2) was associated with an elevated vaginal pH in black ( P < .001) and white ( P = .005) women, a reduced interleukin-1beta response to anaerobic Gram-negative rods and/or Gardnerella vaginalis ( P < .01), and a decreased rate of spontaneous preterm deliveries (6% versus 18%, P = .02). In black women, IL1RN * 2 carriage was associated with increased anaerobic Gram-negative rods, Mycoplasma, and Peptostreptococci and decreased Lactobacilli colonization. CONCLUSION: IL1RN * 2 carriage was associated with a blunted proinflammatory interleukin-1beta response to abnormal vaginal flora. This property may decrease susceptibility to infection-related preterm birth.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of vaginal microflora: the unrecognized association  of Atopobium vaginae with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Although the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains elusive, a few microorganisms, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, are considered markers on Gram stain or culture. Culture-independent analysis of vaginal microflora using 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing of total bacterial communities reveals the gram-positive Atopobium vaginae as a predominant species in disturbed vaginal flora.
TI  - Infections of the lower female genital tract during childhood and adolescence.
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of lower female genital tract infections at a young age. METHODS: Review study. CONCLUSIONS: Lower female genital tract infections at a young age may involve the vulva, the vagina and, less frequently, the fallopian tubes. Good knowledge of the physiology and anatomy of the respective areas plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of vulvovaginitis. Candida albicans is the most frequent cause of infection, while Gardnerella vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma, and Trichomonas vaginalis are rarer ones. The clinical presentation includes a variety of symptoms and signs, with vaginal discharge being the prominent one. Treatment should be causative after careful investigation while preventive advice is mandatory.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of affirm VPIII in the detection and identification of Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Candida species in vaginitis/vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the Affirm VPIII Microbial Identification Test for detection and identification of Candida species, Gardnerella vaginalis and Trichomonas vaginalis to clinical and microscopic criteria commonly used to diagnose vaginitis. METHODS: Women that were symptomatic for vaginitis/vaginosis and asymptomatic women being seen for routine obstetric or gynecological care were included in this study. Women treated with antibiotics or antifungals within one week or women who had douched within 24 hours were excluded. Two vaginal swab specimens were simultaneously obtained from each patient, one swab was placed in sterile physiological saline for immediate microscopic wet mount examination and KOH testing. The other swab was placed in the Affirm collection tube for Affirm VPIII testing based on previously demonstrated methods. RESULTS: The Affirm assay was significantly more likely to identify Gardnerella and Candida than wet mount. 190 (45%) were positive for Gardnerella by Affirm compared to 58 (14%) by wet mount; 45 (11%) were positive for Candida by Affirm compared to 31 (7%) by wet mount; and 30 (7%) were positive for Trichomonas by Affirm compared to 23 (5%) by wet mount. Symptomatic women were significantly more likely to be positive by Affirm only (23% vs. 10%), wet mount only (3% vs. 2%) or Affirm and wet mount (15% vs. 1%). Asymptomatic women were significantly more likely to be negative for Affirm and wet mount (43% vs. 5%). CONCLUSIONS: The Affirm VPIII test is a more sensitive diagnostic test for detection and identification of symptomatic vaginitis/vaginosis than conventional clinical examination and wet mount testing.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis commonly is found in women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), but it is unclear whether bacterial vaginosis leads to incident PID. METHODS: Women (n = 1,179) from 5 U.S. centers were evaluated for a median of 3 years. Every 6-12 months, vaginal swabs were obtained for gram stain and culture of microflora. A vaginal microflora gram stain score of 7-10 was categorized as bacterial vaginosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed by presence of either histologic endometritis or pelvic pain and tenderness plus one of the following: oral temperature greater than 38.3 degrees C; sedimentation rate greater than 15 mm/hour; white blood count greater than 10,000; or lower genital tract detection of leukorrhea, mucopus, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS: After adjustment for relevant demographic and lifestyle factors, baseline bacterial vaginosis was not associated with the development of PID (adjusted hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.55-1.45). Carriage of bacterial vaginosis in the previous 6 months before a diagnosis (adjusted risk ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.71-2.42) also was not significantly associated with PID. Similarly, neither absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus nor high levels of Gardnerella vaginalis significantly increased the risk of PID. Dense growth of pigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods in the 6 months before diagnosis did significantly increase a woman's risk of PID (P =.04). One subgroup of women, women with 2 or more recent sexual partners, demonstrated associations among bacterial vaginosis, Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and PID. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of high-risk women, after adjustment for confounding factors, we found no overall increased risk of developing incident PID among women with bacterial vaginosis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2
TI  - Relationship between a toll-like receptor-4 gene polymorphism, bacterial vaginosis-related flora and vaginal cytokine responses in pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between a single nucleotide polymorphism (TLR4 896 A  > G) in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) gene, qualitative and quantitative changes in vaginal micro-flora and vaginal interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) concentrations in pregnant women were evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative microbial methods were used to characterize vaginal micro-flora of 238 women at 18-22 weeks gestation. Polymerase chain reaction was used to determine TLR4 genotype. IL-1beta and IL-1ra concentrations in vaginal lavage samples were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: The TLR4 variant was identified in 10.3% of women. Carriage of this variant was associated with a median increase in vaginal pH (P = 0.05), a greater than 10-fold increase in vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis levels (P < 0.0001) and a 10-fold increase in the vaginal concentration of three species of anaerobic Gram-negative rods, Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Porphyromonas (P = 0.08 ). Colonization with G. vaginalis and/or the anaerobic Gram-negative rods resulted in elevated vaginal IL-1 (P = 0.01) and IL-1ra (P < 0.0002) concentrations in women who were TLR4 896A homozygotes, but not in TLR4 896G carriers. CONCLUSION: The TLR4 896 A > G polymorphism contributes to inter-individual differences in the vaginal immune defense against G. vaginalis and anaerobic Gram-negative rods.
TI  - [Molecular epidemiologic investigation of infertile male's semen infected by Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the status of the semen of the infertility patients infected by Gardnerella vaginalis (Gv). METHODS: Semen samples from 373 clinic patients of infertility and vaginal samples from 63 positive patients' wives were collected from April 2002 to May 2003. And the samples were tested by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). RESULTS: The positive rate of the infertile males' semen infected by Gv was 44.2%, while that of the postive patients' wives was 87.3%. CONCLUSION: The positive rate of the infertile male's semen infected by Gv is high and Gv can be spread by sexual intercourse.

TI  - [Role of Gardnerella vaginalis in the development of sexually transmitted diseases--diagnostic criteria].
AB  - The authors analyze the results from the clinical and microbiological investigations of Gardnerella vaginalis in two female groups: 28 patients with clinical manifestations of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and a control group of 25 females without any complaints. Along with the data from the anamnesis and the gynecological examination, the following parameters have been examined: a native preparation for "clue cells", pH of vaginal content, ratio between polymorphonuclear leukocytes and epithelial cells, specimens for the diagnosis by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) as well as cultural examination by using HBT agar (human blood two-layer Tween agar). The authors discuss five diagnostic criteria and emphasize that the diagnosis of BV requires the presence of at least four of them. Every criterion possesses a high frequency (between 67.86 and 100 per cent) among the female patients with clinical evidence of BV.
TI  - Nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a Gram stain of a vaginal smear. Treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. A study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of BV by the Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that Bacteroides or Prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. In one case, only Gardnerella vaginalis was found. These findings illustrate that BV remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either Gardnerella or Mobiluncus. Use of a FemExam system (Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT), based upon elevated pH and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the Gram stain method. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with BV but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14. These studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for BV. If such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains L. rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14.
TI  - Fenticonazole nitrate for treatment of vulvovaginitis: efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 1-gram ovules, administered as ultra-short 2-day regimen.
AB  - Because of its potential as a low cost first-line monotherapy for the most common vulvovaginal infections, we evaluated fenticonazole nitrate in a prospective, open-label, multicenter pilot study with 101 sexually active women (per-protocol; 16 to 61 years of age) with vulvovaginitis involving single or mixed infections with Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, and/or Gardnerella vaginalis. Fenticonazole nitrate (1 g) was administered as vaginal ovules, once daily on days 1 and 3. Eradication (direct phase-contrast microscopy of vaginal swabs and/or microbiological culture) on day 8 was 90% (C. albicans, 26/29, p < 0.001), 70% (T. vaginalis, 7/10, p = 0.161), 67% (G. vaginalis, 22/33, p < 0.009), and 45% (mixed infection, 13/29, p = 0.001). After 28 days, relapse was 0% for candidiasis and trichomoniasis, 27% (6/22) for G. vaginalis, and 23% (3/13) for mixed infection. Overall, eradication of all offending pathogens was achieved in 67% of the total per-protocol population, with a relapse rate of only 16%. Score sums for symptoms improved from 7.0 (baseline) to 1.7 (day 8), and 0.71 (day 28), (p < 0.001). Treatment was safe and well tolerated. The results of our pilot study suggest that application of fenticonazole nitrate 1 g intravaginal ovules on 2 alternate days is a suitable first-line treatment of vulvovaginitis with acceptable broad-spectrum efficacy against the most commonly involved pathogens and with a low rate of early relapse, reserving antibiotics for patients with treatment failure or relapse of infection. Our results should encourage further examination of this approach in larger and well controlled clinical trials.
TI  - A disproportionate increase in IL-1beta over IL-1ra in the cervicovaginal secretions of pregnant women with altered vaginal microflora correlates with preterm birth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This purpose of this study was to investigate the association between  vaginal microflora, concentrations of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and its natural receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in the cervicovaginal discharge, and spontaneous preterm birth. Study design Vaginal samples collected at 18 to 22 weeks' gestation from 207 women were analyzed to study qualitative and quantitative microbiologic aspects of vaginal microflora and IL-1beta and IL-1ra concentrations. RESULTS: Among women colonized with anaerobic Gram-negative rods and/or Gardnerella vaginalis, an elevated IL-1beta concentration, or a diminished IL-1ra:IL-1beta ratio were associated with preterm delivery. A cut-off IL-1ra:IL-1beta ratio of <8632:1 optimally discriminated the subjects with subsequent spontaneous preterm deliveries from subjects who delivered at term, with a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 51%, positive predictive value of 21%, and negative predictive value of 95%. CONCLUSION: A disproportionate increase in IL-1beta over IL-1ra in response to vaginal colonization with anaerobic Gram-negative rods and/or G. vaginalis at 18 to 22 weeks' gestation is associated with spontaneous preterm delivery.
TI  - [Studies on the infection status of seven species Mycoplasma, three species of Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Garderella vaginalis in 76 patients with sexual transmitted diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious status of seven species of Mycoplasma, three species of Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Garderella vaginalis in the 76 male sexual transmitted disease (STD) patients in Yangzhou city. METHODS: Twelve species of pathogens including Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu), Mycoplasma hominis (Mh), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mpn), Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg), Mycoplasma fermentans (Mf), Mycoplasma penetrans (Mpe), Mycoplasma prium (Mpi), Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn), Chlamydia psittaci (Cps), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) and Garderella vaginalis (GV) were detected by nested polymerase chain reaction including PPNG. RESULTS: The positive rates of Uu, Mh, Mpn, Mg, Mf, Mpe, Ct, Ng were 64.5%, 27.6%, 26.3%, 18.4%, 2.6%, 2.6%, 31.6%, 36.8%, in which Penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG) accounted for 14.3%, GV 15.8%. No Mpi, Cpn or Cps were found. There was more significant therapeutic effects on the detectable rate of Mycoplasma nucleic acid between positive gonococcus and negative gonococcus in male STDs patients (chi(2) = 3.848, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The infection rates of Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Ng and GV were high among male STD patients in Yangzhou city. In clinical practice, more attention should be paid on correct diagnosis and treatment for patients, with Gonococcus, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and GV.
TI  - [Abnormal bacterial colonisation of the vagina and implantation during assisted reproduction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of our treatment of vaginal infection for couples included in an IVF program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Microbiologic screening of vaginal flora and semen has been performed one month prior to in vitro fertilization for 951 couples in 2000. Antibiotic treatment was prescribed in case of positive culture. RESULTS: Positive microbial growths were observed from endocervical and vaginal cultures in 218 women (22.9%). The clinical pregnancy rate was 30.29% in the group of patients without growth and 30.27% in the group with positive microbial growth. The implantation rate was significantly diminished in case of bacterial growth: 14.6 compared to 19.3% (P <0.02) for sterile endocervical culture. Five main bacterial species were found at the cervical level: Candida albicans (69 cases), Ureaplasma urealyticum (49 cases), Gardnerella vaginalis (43 cases), Streptococcus B or D (24 cases) and Escherichia coli (22 cases). Positive cultures from both vagina and semen were observed for 77 couples whose clinical pregnancy rate was 19.5 vs 36.2% in case of vaginal infection alone (P <0.01) with a spontaneous miscarriage rate of 46.7 compared to 17.6% (P <0.01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Endocervical microorganisms, even treated with adapted antibiotics, may affect embryonic implantation. Positive culture from both female and male partner may enhance this negative effect. In this case, the best strategy would be to cancel the IVF treatment.
TI  - [Microbiological findings in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in  the Hradec Kralove Faculty Hospital 1995-2002].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the microbiological findings in the patients with the recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) with a focus on the establishment of fungal etiology and its in vitro antifungal susceptibility. DESIGN: Retrospective clinical and laboratory study. SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical Faculty Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Prague, Department of Clinical Microbiology, Medical Faculty Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Prague, Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Prague. METHODS: An analysis of clinical and anamnestic data in outpatients of the Dept. of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the laboratory data from the microbiological examinations performed in the Dept. of Clinical Microbiology from 1995 to 2002. RESULTS: Candida albicans accounted for 88.5% of the episodes of RVVC in the setting of 56 patients. Non-albicans Candida species were represented especially by C. glabrata (4.9%) and C. krusei (3.1%). There were no considerable differences between the spectrum of RVVC and acute vulvovaginal candidiasis with the exception of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.7% in RVVC vs. 3.7% in acute VVC). Mycological findings in 61 (20.5%) samples were accompanied by bacterial microbiota with the predominance of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 15) and Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 9). Decreased antifungal susceptibility determined by the disk test was observed in the strains of C. glabrata, C. krusei and S. cerevisiae, the other yeast isolates being susceptible to all ten antifungal drugs tested. CONCLUSION: The microbiological examination was decisive for the establishment of the diagnosis of RVVC in most cases. The most frequent etiological agents responsible for the attacks of RVVC as well as for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis was C. albicans, which was generally susceptible to antifungal drugs.
TI  - [Prevalence of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections among high-risk patients attending a free anonymous HIV-screening center].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among patients attending an anonymous HIV Screening Center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study was performed in the HIV Screening Center of University hospital in Reims (France) from May 1997 to December 1997. The inclusion criteria were the asymptomatic clinical presentation and the presence of risk factors for sexually transmitted infections referring to WHO criteria. The methods included clinical examination after application of acetic acid and urethral and endocervical swabs to identify:Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis in specific culture. Treponema pallidum and HIV-1 infection were both detected by Enzym Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). RESULTS: One hundred and one patients (62 men and 39 women) were included in the study. Their mean age was 27 +/- 4 Years. Risk factors for sexually transmitted infections were: multiple sexual partners 81 p. 100; homo or bisexuality 16 p. 100; intravenous drug use 3 p. 100. The sexually transmitted infections were: HIV-1 infection 1 p. 100;Ureaplasma urealyticum 25 p. 100; genital warts 5 p. 100;Chlamydia trachomatis 3 p. 100; Gardnerella vaginalis 3 p. 100; Mycoplasma hominis 2 p. 100; Treponema pallidum 0 p. 100; Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0 p. 100; Trichomonas vaginalis 0 p. 100. The prevalence of sexually transmitted infections was significantly higher among women (p<0.05). DISCUSSION: Classical sexually transmitted infections and HIV infection were rarely detected in this study; but prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (genital warts, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum) was high. Ureaplasma urealyticum is considered as a possible pathogenic agent in pregnant women (preterm delivery, decrease of birth weight, chorioamniotitis). These results suggest that other than sexually transmitted infections in high risk patients attending a HIV Screening Center other sexually transmitted infections should also be systematically screened for.
TI  - Cloning of 16S rRNA genes amplified from normal and disturbed vaginal microflora  suggests a strong association between Atopobium vaginae, Gardnerella vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains largely elusive, although some microorganisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis, are suspected of playing a role in the etiology of this disorder. Recently culture-independent analysis of microbial ecosystems has proven its efficacy in characterizing the diversity of bacterial populations. Here, we report on the results obtained by combining culture and PCR-based methods to characterize the normal and disturbed vaginal microflora. RESULTS: A total of 150 vaginal swab samples from healthy women (115 pregnant and 35 non-pregnant) were categorized on the basis of Gram stain of direct smear as grade I (n = 112), grade II (n = 26), grade III (n = 9) or grade IV (n = 3). The composition of the vaginal microbial community of eight of these vaginal swabs (three grade I, two grade II and three grade III), all from non-pregnant women, were studied by culture and by cloning of the 16S rRNA genes obtained after direct amplification. Forty-six cultured isolates were identified by tDNA-PCR, 854 cloned 16S rRNA gene fragments were analysed of which 156 by sequencing, yielding a total of 38 species, including 9 presumptively novel species with at least five species that have not been isolated previously from vaginal samples. Interestingly, cloning revealed that Atopobium vaginae was abundant in four out of the five non-grade I specimens. Finally, species specific PCR for A. vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis pointed to a statistically significant co-occurrence of both species in the bacterial vaginosis samples. CONCLUSIONS: Although historically the literature regarding bacterial vaginosis has largely focused on G. vaginalis in particular, several findings of this study--like the abundance of A. vaginae in disturbed vaginal microflora and the presence of several novel species--indicate that much is to be learned about the composition of the vaginal microflora and its relation to the etiology of BV.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: comparison of Pap smear and microbiological test results.
AB  - Our purpose was to determine the reliability of the Pap smear in making the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and to examine the characteristics of Pap smear vs vaginal culture in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, with the vaginal Gram stain used as the diagnostic standard. We performed a prospective, blinded study involving 245 women who referred to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics in our hospital for routine genital examination between September 2001 and September 2002. Exclusion criteria included vaginal bleeding and pregnancy. Each patient had standard Pap smear, Gram-stained vaginal smear and culture of vaginal swab. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic value of Pap smear and vaginal culture results were determined with Gram stain used as the standard for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Using Gram stain diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as the standard, Pap smear and vaginal culture test results had sensitivity of 43.1 and 77.8%, specificity of 93.6 and 97.7%, positive predictive value of 73.8 and 93.3%, negative predictive value of 79.8 and 91.4%, diagnostic value of 78.8 and 91.8%, respectively, for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Compared to the microbiological test results, Pap smear is not sensitive enough for screening of bacterial vaginosis. However, because of its high specificity, it may be an adequate diagnostic criteria when it is positive.
TI  - Prevalence of HIV among women with vaginal discharge in a gynecological clinic.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vaginal discharge is a common complaint among women with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in Nigeria. Given the association between STDs and HIV and the alarming rise in the prevalence of HIV in Nigeria, we performed this study to determine the prevalence of HIV in patients with vaginal discharge. STUDY DESIGN: Between April 2000 and August 2000, women who attended the Lagos University Teaching Hospital and complained of vaginal discharge were adequately counseled for HIV serotest. High vaginal/endocervical swabs and venous blood were taken for microbiological studies and HIV serotest, respectively. RESULTS: Out of the 230 women counseled for HIV serotest 140 (60.9%) consented. The mean age of the 140 was 31.1+/-6.9 years (range 18-50 years). In 31 (22.1%), Candida albicans was isolated, in 26 Gardnerella vaginalis (18.8%), in 17 Staphylococcal spp. (12.1%); and E. coli, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neisseria gonococcus in 7.9%, 4.3%, and 1.4%, respectively. Four (2.9%) of the 140 patients were HIV seropositive, and all had Candida albicans isolated. The prevalence of HIV among patients with Candida albicans was 12.9%. Association between HIV seropositivity and Candida albicans infection is significant (X2=14.48; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Candida albicans is a common cause of vaginal discharge among HIV-seropositive women in Lagos.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis-infected scalp hematoma associated with electronic fetal monitoring.
AB  - Infections in the neonate caused by the vaginal commensal Gardnerella vaginalis are rare and mostly consist of bacteremia. A 4130-g term neonate developed an infection of a scalp hematoma with G. vaginalis. The infection developed in association with electronic fetal monitoring. The only clinical sign was an increase in size of the hematoma.
TI  - Cervical immunoglobulin A and altered vaginal flora in pregnant women with threatened preterm delivery.
AB  - The aim of our study was to investigate the cervical immunoglobulin A concentration in women with threatened preterm delivery. Immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of 80 women with symptoms of preterm delivery was measured using radial immunodiffusion. The results were compared with those of 60 healthy pregnant women. Concentrations of immunoglobulins in maternal serum were also measured. There was no significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration between women with threatened preterm delivery and controls: 53.98 (0.0-189.7) mg/l vs. 61.7 (1.4-400.9; p<0.4) mg/l (median, range). The median of cervical IgA levels in the group of threatened preterm delivery did not differ significantly between patients delivered preterm (n=34) or at term (n=46): 38.3 (0.0-187.9) vs. 65.7 (1.4-189.7; p<0.2) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical IgA concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 72.7 (0.0-187.9) vs. 42.5 (0.0-189.7) mg/l. Patients with a pathological vaginal smear and preterm delivery had the lowest IgA levels (35.0; 0.0-187.9 mg/l). Measurement of cervical IgA concentration does not differentiate between women who deliver before or at term.
TI  - Light microscopy observation of lytic enzymatic activity of the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In this study, cervico-vaginal smears taken from 500 patients were examined cytologically using the Papanicolaou technique. Seventeen of the 500 were classified as having bacterial vaginosis. Lytic enzymatic activity of the organisms on clue cells were determined at light microscopic level. The integrity of the cell and the smoothness of the cell membrane were disrupted. Small cavities on the cell membrane and hollows in the cytoplasm were observed. Due to the loss of cytoplasm, very narrow and thin tracks around the nucleus and in the cytoplasm resembling a cobweb were seen. It is suggested that these lytic cellular changes might be formed by the organisms on clue cells.
TI  - Human papillomavirus cervical infection in Guarani Indians from the rainforest of Misiones, Argentina.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) cervical infection in women from the South American Guarani Indian tribe located in the rain forest of Misiones, north-eastern Argentina; a region with a high incidence of cervical carcinoma. METHODS: A cross-sectional cytological and HPV screening of sexually active Guarani women from nine Indian settlements was conducted. Demographic data, information about sexual behavior, and gynaecological history were recorded. Fresh cervical specimens from 239 patients were collected, of which 207 were included in this study. Cytology and microbiological detection were carried out by the Papanicolaou and Gram stain methods, respectively. HPV detection and typing were analyzed by PCR and RFLP. RESULTS: Pap smears in 96% of all patients showed an inflammatory pattern. A possible etiologic agent was found in 58% of cases: 52% Trichomonas vaginalis, 35% Gardnerella vaginalis and 13% Candida sp. Seven cases had cytological changes compatible with Low Grade Intraepithelial Lesion (LGSIL), one with High Grade Intraepithelial Lesion (HGSIL) and one in situ cervical cancer. The prevalence for generic HPV infection was 64% (133/207). Genotyping gave a 26% prevalence for HPV types 16/18, 13% for types 6/11 and 30% for other types, with nine mixed infections. CONCLUSION: This work reports for the first time the prevalence of cervical HPV infection in Guarani women. Nearly all Guarani women had some grade of cervical disease. Generic HPV infection prevalence was elevated (64%), with predominance of high risk types 16/18. A large variety of viral types was detected, including high to intermediate risk types not found previously in the region.
TI  - Culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  - Renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. In this study, a culture-independent 16S rRNA-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. Similarly sized amplicons encompassing the V6 to V8 region of the 16S rRNA were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) (WAVE System). Artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. We evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and DHPLC generated peak profiles. However, for culture-negative specimens, DHPLC facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. DNA sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. Thus, in PCR-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as Corynebacterium urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including Anaerococcus lactolyticus, Bacteroides vulgatus, Dialister invisus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus iners, Leptotrichia amnionii, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella ruminicola, Rahnella aquatilis, and Streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. The method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both DHPLC-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. A detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.
TI  - Prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases among pregnant women in Ilorin, Nigeria.
AB  - In a cross-sectional study, 230 pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic of  the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Ilorin, Nigeria from January 2000 to December 2000 were screened randomly to determine the prevalence of common STDs among them, using conventional methods. One hundred and fourteen (49.4%) of the subjects harboured various agents including Candida spp. (37.8%), Trichomonas vaginalis (4.7%), Gardnerella vaginalis (3.9%), syphilis (1.7%) and Neisseria gonorrhea (1.3%). Risk factors associated with significant infection were young age and level of education. The importance of routine STD screening in pregnancy especially among the young and illiterate is advocated. It is recommended that routine screening for STDs should be incorporated into antenatal care.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in the genital tract the last trimester of pregnancy].
AB  - Very widespread in our clinical setting, early-onset sepsis is due to organisms that commonly colonize or infect the maternal genital tract; identifying such organisms would help improve prevention and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial ecology and the pathological status of the genital organs during the last trimester of pregnancy, in order to evaluate the risk of materno-fetal infections and to improve the present prophylactic measures based on monitoring bacterial carriage during the first trimester. METHOD: Vaginal and endocervical samples, usually taken during the first trimester of pregnancy were delayed and taken during the last trimester of pregnancy, in patients with no signs of sepsis and not taking antibiotics. A macroscopic examination described the aspect of the vagina, the cervix uteri, leukorrhea and possible inflammatory lesions or ulcerations. A microscopic examination searched for parasites, epithelial cells, Clue cells and leukocytes. The appropriate bacteriological cultures were performed after reading the Gram stain and scoring the vaginal flora. The clinical and cytobacteriological aspects were used to identify the bacterial ecology and the pathological genital states. RESULTS: Genital samples were collected from 306 pregnant women. Among them 118 were at 29-32 weeks of gestation, 104 at 33-36 and 84 at 37-40. The most frequent germs were C. albicans (33.3%), Enterobacteriaceae (20.3%) including E. coli (10.9%), S. aureus (15.4%), Gardnerella (13.6%), and Trichomonas (10.6%), in monomicrobian (79.2%) or polymicrobian carriage (20.8%). Lower genital tract pathological states such as vaginitis (29.4%), bacterial vaginosis (21.5%) or cervicitis (10.4%) and asymptomatic bacterial carriage (23.5%) and normal genital flora (15%) were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of genital bacterial carriage in African women during the last trimester of pregnancy. Larger studies are required to evaluate the risk of maternofetal infections and to improve current prophylaxis measures.
TI  - The potential for probiotics to prevent bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor.
AB  - Infections of the urogenital tract in women represent a major burden on the quality of life of women and on the health care system of Canada and other countries. Complications arising from bacterial vaginosis (BV) include increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases including human immunodeficiency virus and elevated risk of preterm birth (PTB). Pharmaceutical interventions, such as antibiotics, have been suboptimally effective and have failed to reduce the incidence of PTB. The absence of lactobacilli in the vagina, a specific feature of BV, raises the question as to whether restoration of lactobacilli, by probiotic therapy, can restore the normal flora and improve the chances of having a healthy term pregnancy. The rationale for probiotic use in pregnant women is quite strong. Certain lactobacilli strains can safely colonize the vagina after oral and vaginal administration, displace and kill pathogens including Gardnerella vaginalis and Escherichia coli, and modulate the immune response to interfere with the inflammatory cascade that leads to PTB. Additional attributes of probiotics include their potential to degrade lipids and enhance cytokine levels, which promote embryo development. In a society that focuses on disease rather than health and drug therapy rather than natural preventive measures, it will take some effort to get remedies such as probiotics into mainstream care. Perhaps the escalating health care budgets and emergence of "superbugs" will provide the incentives to put in place clinical trials designed to evaluate how best to use the commensal organisms that, after all, make up more of our body than human cells, and without which none of us would survive.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginitis: general overview].
AB  - Bacteria are the most frequently detected agents in women, clinically complaining of vaginal discharge. The studies have shown that the vaginal microflora of women with bacterial vaginitis have altered from Lactobacillus spp. to various anaerobic bacteria. Gardnerella vaginalis is found in vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginitis as well as in healthy women, while anaerobic bacteria such as Mobiluncus and Prevotella are the causative agents for bacterial vaginosis. For the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginitis, direct microscopy is one of the most commonly used methods, and for this purpose cervicovaginal smears are examined by staining Papanicolaou and Gram stains. Because of the demonstration of bacterial vaginitis in association with the obstetric diseases such as preterm labor and postpartum endometritis, is a risk factor, its importance has increased recently. In this review article, the microorganisms that cause bacterial vaginitis, their biological characteristics, and the diagnostic laboratory methods of infection, have been discussed.

TI  - Can known risk factors explain racial differences in the occurrence of bacterial  vaginosis?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Black women are more likely to have bacterial vaginosis (BV) than are non-Hispanic white women. We examined whether this disparity can be explained by racial differences in known BV risk factors. METHODS: Nine hundred black and 235 white women were enrolled from five US sites. At baseline, structured interviews were conducted and vaginal swabs self-collected for Gram-stain and culture. RESULTS: Black women were more likely than white women to have BV/intermediate vaginal flora. They also were more likely to be older, have lower educational attainment and family incomes, have a history of a sexually transmitted disease, and douche. After adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors, blacks remained at elevated risk for BV/intermediate flora (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.1). Blacks also were more likely to have specific BV-related vaginal microflora, as well as gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.8) after adjustment for known BV risk factors. CONCLUSION: Risk factor differences did not explain the observed racial disparity in the occurrence of BV, BV-related microflora, or gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis. These findings highlight our limited understanding of the factors accounting for the occurrence of bacterial vaginosis and cervicitis among black and white women.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of Gardnerella vaginalis vaginosis.
AB  - An evaluation of various laboratory detection methods and characteristics of Gardnerella vaginalis was made using high vaginal swab samples of 470 out patient clinic--attending women. Gram stain for 'clue cells' showed positive results in 118 (25.1%)cases; culture, in 100 cases, (213%) and Amine Odour (213%), in 26 cases 5.5%, Majority, 71 cases, of the culture-positive results were associated with a pH value of 6 to 7. Gardnerella vaginalis grew predominantly in enriched culture media: Modified peptone-starch dextrose blood agar used for primary culture of organism, and also proteose peptone broth + cooked meat; Brain-heart infusion broth + 5% human serum; Brain heart infusion starch agar + 5% blood, and chocolate agar. Gardnerella vaginalis culture-positive samples also exhibited positive biochemical reactions with the hydrolysis of starch sensitivity to Bacitracin and 50 microg metronidazole, and haemolysis on human blood agar. Carbohydrate fermentation test was positive for all culture-positive cases, 100% for starch and maltose only, and negative for all the cases, 0% for Mannitol and glycerol.
TI  - Activity of Novispirin G-10, a novel antimicrobial peptide against Chlamydia trachomatis and vaginosis-associated bacteria.
AB  - We tested the activity of Novispirin G-10, a novel antimicrobial alpha-helical octadecapeptide structurally related to cathelicidins and other innate immunity peptides, against Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L2, D, and E and three organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). The peptide's activity against C. trachomatis was measured in 48-h shell vial assays with McCoy cell targets. Exposure to 100 micro g/ml of Novispirin G-10 reduced the infectivity of serovars D and E by 99.4-100% and serovar L2 by 91.7-99.1%. At the same concentration of 100 micro g/ml, Novispirin G-10 rapidly killed >99% of Mobiluncus curtisii, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Prevotella bivia, in standard colony-forming unit (CFU) assays. Given its simple structure and relative lack of cytotoxic and hemolytic activity, Novispirin G-10 may be a useful component of microbicide preparations designed to prevent chlamydial infection and/or remediate the abnormal vaginal flora associated with BV.
TI  - Increased risk of cervical canal infections with intracervical Foley catheter.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of intracervical Foley catheter insertion, for  the induction of labor, on cervical canal infection. DESIGN: A prospective interventional study with paired analysis. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The study was conducted in the department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Aga Khan University, Karachi, between June 1 and August 31, 2002. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In 45 women undergoing cervical ripening with intracervical Foley catheter for the induction of labour at term, cervical swabs were taken for culture and sensitivity before its insertion and again after its spontaneous expulsion or removal. RESULTS: Intracervical Foley catheter was retained for mean duration of 8.1 +/- 1.7 hours. There was a significant change in the pathogenic organisms (0 % v 16.3 %; p 0.016) from pre-Foley to post-Foley catheter cervical swab cultures. Growth of beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group-B, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata and Gardnerella vaginalis on cervical swab were considered pathogenic. One woman (2.2 %) developed fever following insertion of intracervical Foley catheter. No statistically significant effect of potential confounding factors was observed on change in growth of pathogenic organisms. CONCLUSION: Induction of labour at term with Foley catheter is associated with a significant increase in intracervical pathogenic organisms despite undertaking routine aseptic measures. We recommend evaluation of this technique for its potential infectious harm in larger studies. Meanwhile, extreme aseptic measures should be undertaken during its insertion to avoid maternal and possible neonatal infections.

TI  - Role of the vaginal microbiological ecosystem and cytokine profile in the promotion of cervical dysplasia: a case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify alterations in the cytokine profile and microbial ecosystem of the vagina in association with cervical dysplasia. METHODS: Demographics, lifestyle variables and Papanicolau (Pap) smear results of subjects presenting to the same site for gynecologic complaints, obstetric visits or colposcopy were prospectively recorded. Vaginal smear for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, pH, and wet mount and KOH examination for Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis and yeast organisms were performed. Vaginal lavage specimens were centrifuged, and the pellets and supernatants were assayed for human papillomavirus (HPV) by polymerase chain reaction and for cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Subjects with abnormal Pap smears underwent colposcopy and biopsy as indicated. RESULTS: Of 51 patients, 32 were referred for colposcopy, 12 presented with gynecologic needs, and seven presented for obstetric visits. Median age was 24 years. Demographics did not differ significantly between the dysplasia and control groups except for a trend towards more sexual partners in the dysplasia group. Biopsies were performed in 81% (26/32) of patients presenting for colposcopy and 17 revealed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-12 levels were elevated in 63% (20/32), 38% (15/39), 4% (2/49), and 0% of samples respectively. Elevated vaginal lavage IL-1beta was associated with a 6.1 odds ratio (95% confidence interval 1.06-35) of cervical dysplasia. Alterations in other variables studied were not associated with cervical dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated IL-1beta, possibly representing a complex host inflammatory response to multiple pathogens, was demonstrated in patients with cervical dysplasia.
TI  - [Role of bacteria associated with sexually transmitted infections in the etiology of lower urinary tract infection in primary care].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the second most frequent type of infectious pathology treated in primary care clinics. The participation of microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted infection has been reported as a cause of UTI; nevertheless this concept is still controversial. To gather data on this subject, we carried out a search for Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis and Streptococcus agalactiae besides the common microorganisms involved in UTI. METHODS: A total of 1507 urine cultures from patients with a clinical diagnosis of low UTI were analyzed. Samples were inoculated onto 5% sheep blood agar and McConkey agar, as well as HBT medium for G. vaginalis, and U9B broth and agar E broth for M. hominis and U. urealyticum. The following parameters were analyzed as possible risk factors: age, sex, pregnancy and diabetes status. RESULTS. There were 436 (28.9%) positive urine cultures. Escherichia coli was isolated in 44.34% of cases. Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in 162 (37%): G. vaginalis (25.7%), U. urealyticum (5.9%), S. agalactiae (3.4%) and M. hominis (2%). UTI were more frequent among the 20 to 40 year-old age group, in women and in diabetic patients. CONCLUSIONS: Microorganisms associated with sexually transmitted disease were found in a large percentage of cultures, indicating the need for studies to clarify their role in the etiology of UTI.
TI  - [Amplification of bacterial heat shock protein 60 gene using inverse PCR method].
AB  - A method is presented for rapid in vitro amplification of DNA sequences of bacterial HSP60 gene. In our previous work, using degenerate oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of HSP60 gene, a 600 bp fragment was amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. An inverse PCR method, with the primers oriented in the reversed direction of the usual orientation, is used to amplify the DNA sequences that flank the 600 bp known region. The feasibility of this method is shown by amplifying the complete HSP60 gene sequences of 4 bacterial strains, namely Bifidobacterium denticolens, Bifidobacterium inopinatum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Gardnerella vaginalis.
TI  - [Sexual transmissible diseases and "returning leukorrhea"].

TI  - Determination of immunoglobulin A against Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin, sialidase, and prolidase activities in vaginal fluid: implications for adverse pregnancy outcomes.
AB  - A nested case-control study of low birth weight and preterm delivery was performed with singleton women. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) against the Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin (anti-Gvh IgA) and sialidase and prolidase activities were determined in vaginal fluid at 17 weeks of gestation. Sialidase positivity and bacterial vaginosis with high prolidase activity were associated with 2- and 11-fold increased risks for low birth weight, respectively. No woman with bacterial vaginosis plus a strong anti-Gvh IgA response had an adverse outcome.
TI  - [Allelic polymorphism of the tem(M) determinant in Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical isolates resistant to tetracyclines].
AB  - Of the 130 clinical isolates of Mycoplasma hominis from patients with nonspecific inflammatory diseases of the urogenital tract (UGT), approximately 10% contained the tet(M) gene after the course of treatment with tetracyclines. This gene was found in nine (25%) of the 36 Ureaplasma urealyticum clinical isolates. The nucleotide sequence of 13 tet(M) genes in TcR clinical isolates of M. hominis and five genes in U. urealyticum TcR clinical isolates was determined. A comparison of nucleotide sequences of eight tetM genes of different origin and tet(M) genes of Gardnerella vaginalis and M. hominis and U. urealyticum clinical isolates showed that the mosaic structure of the tet(M) gene is completely identical in 11 of 13 M. hominis TcR isolates but belongs to an unidentified allele different from those described earlier, Another new allelic variant of tet(M) was found in two isolates. In three of five TcR clinical isolates of U. urealyticum, a tet(M) gene, whose mosaic structure was identical to that of tet(M) reported previously for ureaplasmas, and also two new allelic variants, which have not been described so far, were found.
TI  - Recurrent bacterial vaginosis in a virgin adolescent: a new method of treatment.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial infection of the vagina and should not be considered an exclusively sexually transmitted disease. We describe the case of a 17-year-old female virgin adolescent with recurrent malodorous vaginal discharge for 6 months. Before referral to us she had been treated unsuccessfully with conservative treatment options. Our investigation revealed Gardnerella vaginalis as the responsible factor for the vaginal infection. Because metronidazole treatment had failed as monotherapy, a new method was applied. Repeated vaginal washings with 3% H(2)O(2), 15% NaCl and 10% providone iodine were initiated. At the end of each washing, vaginal walls were thoroughly cleaned up with a small gauze. After 10 days of treatment the odor and the vaginal discharge had ceased and 12 months later no relapse had occurred. It seems to be reasonable to use this kind of treatment in recurrent BV.
TI  - [Retrospective microbiologic evaluation of vaginal cultures].
AB  - Vaginal culture is one of the most difficult cultures to be evaluated in clinical microbiology practice. The necessity of some expensive and complicated processes for diagnosis of some specific agents, age related variability of normal vaginal flora and failure caused by temporary presence of some pathogens in normal flora can be listed among the probable causes of that problem. In this study 8050 vaginal cultures performed in our hospital laboratories between 1 March 1999-15 September 2001 were evaluated retrospectively. It was shown that the most frequently isolated pathogens were yeasts belonging to the Candida genus (26.8%). The second most frequent pathogen (13.8%) was Gardnerella vaginalis which was an indicator of bacterial vaginosis. The rate of isolation of Trichomonas vaginalis was 2.2%. Group B streptococcus (GBS) was isolated in 2.0% of the total cultures. Some nonspecific bacteria, mainly Gram negative bacilli, were noted as colonizing agents (6.5%).
TI  - Effectiveness of current therapy of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The study was conducted in order to evaluate effectiveness of the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) with different therapeutic regimes according to recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO). During a one-year period (February 2000-February 2001) the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Center was visited by 482 women aged 14-51. The diagnosis of BV was established by standard methods: Amsel's clinical criteria and Gram stain of vaginal discharge. The first-line treatment was oral Metronidazole 2 g single dose. Second line was Metronidazole 500 mg twice daily orally for 7 days or oral Clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for seven days. BV was confirmed in 74 women (15.4%). Most often it was observed in women aged 17-30 years of age. Thirty-three (44.6% of total) were young women 14-21 years of age. Thirty-one (42%) women received a follow-up examination and of those, 11 (38.7%) needed a repeat treatment for BV due to unsatisfactory results of this treatment. It is concluded that treatment of BV with standard methods was not always effective with no significant difference between women under 21 years and older women found in regards to response to treatment. Besides antibiotic treatment, the so-called Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus) can be taken into consideration as an alternative treatment. Additional research about the therapeutic effect of this type of drugs is needed.
TI  - Microbiology and management of polymicrobial female genital tract infections in adolescents.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology and management of female genital tract infections in adolescents. These infections include vulvovaginitis, vulvovaginal pyogenic infections (abscesses of Bartholin's and Skene's glands, infected labial inclusion cysts, labial abscesses, furunculosis, and hidradenitis), endometritis, pyometritis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian and pelvic abscess. Anaerobes can be cultured in 50% to 90% of females with a variety of genital infections and are the exclusive isolates in 20% to 50%. Obligate anaerobes are particularly common in closed-space infections, such as tubo-ovarian and vulvovaginal abscesses. The most common anaerobes found in these infections are gram-negative bacilli (especially P. bivia and P. disiens) and anaerobic cocci. Anaerobes generally are not the only pathogens found, but are usually mixed with aerobes. The most common aerobic pathogens are members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, especially E. coli, and aerobic or microaerophilic streptococci. Sexually acquired infections include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex, and Condyloma accuminata. Treatment regimens must provide antimicrobial coverage for N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, anaerobes, streptococci, and gram-negative facultative bacteria.
TI  - Detection of bacterial vaginosis-related organisms by real-time PCR for Lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of detecting bacterial vaginosis (BV)-related organisms in stored genital tract specimens using real-time PCR. Frozen cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples from 21 women were analyzed by real-time PCR for the numbers of Mycoplasma hominis, Gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli. Lactobacilli organisms were detected in all CVL samples, G. vaginalis was detected in all but one sample, while M. hominis was detected in only six samples. Using the Amsel criteria to define BV, the samples from women with BV had significantly higher numbers of G. vaginalis organisms than samples from women without BV (P=0.004). In contrast, the number of lactobacilli organisms in BV samples was significantly lower (P=0.013). The number of M. hominis organisms was not significantly different between BV-positive and BV-negative samples. A striking relationship was observed where most of the samples contained high numbers of either lactobacilli or G. vaginalis but not both. These results show that it is possible to determine the presence of BV-related organisms in stored genital tract samples by PCR, suggesting that this could be developed into an objective method that could be useful for certain applications.
TI  - Chronic intrauterine and fetal infection with Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a model of chronic intrauterine and fetal infection with Gardnerella vaginalis. STUDY DESIGN: The uterine horns of pregnant New Zealand White rabbits were inoculated on day 21 of gestation with either 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) of G vaginalis or saline solution. At necropsy, cultures were taken from blood, uterus, amniotic fluid, and fetal tissues. Amniotic fluid was assayed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha by bioassay. Maternal and fetal tissue samples were evaluated using the histologic index score. A P value <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Compared with saline solution-inoculated animals, the G vaginalis group had significantly more positive cultures from uterus, amniotic fluid, and fetal brain and lung (P =.02 to <.01). For the G vaginalis group, mean TNF-alpha levels and fetal brain scores increased significantly over time (P <.001 for both). CONCLUSION: Chronic intrauterine and fetal infection with G vaginalis is accompanied by progressive increases in amniotic fluid TNF-alpha concentrations and fetal brain histologic index scores.
TI  - In vitro activities of Garenoxacin (BMS 284756) against 108 clinical isolates of  Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Garenoxacin (BMS 284756) was active against 105 of 108 (97%) recent clinical Gardnerella vaginalis isolates at < or =2 micro g/ml by using the reference agar dilution method for anaerobes. Twenty-eight percent of isolates (31 of 108) were resistant to metronidazole, and 44% were resistant to doxycycline. All were susceptible to clindamycin and ampicillin-sulbactam.
TI  - [Microbiological investigation of the vaginal flora during pregnancy].
AB  - The infections complications during pregnancy and delivery are jet unsolved problem in obstetrics and neonatology. Most of them are due to anaerobic and aerobic organisms. The authors show the rate and distribution of the bacterial vaginal infections during pregnancy. 1330 pregnant women are investigated, 10% of them are with normal vaginal flora, 27% anaerobic organisms, 15% aerobic organisms, then Candida albicans and Gardnerella vaginalis. Those results are seen most frequently during the last trimester of pregnancy, which leads to the complications in delivery and postpartum.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dequalinium chloride against leading germs of vaginal infections.
AB  - Dequalinium chloride (CAS 522-51-0) and povidone iodine (CAS 25655-41-8) are known as antiseptic agents and used in the local treatment of vaginal infections. Clotrimazole (CAS 23593-75-1) is an anti-fungal drug and applied primarily in the therapy of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and to a lesser extent in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis. However, antimicrobial activities of those three agents in comparison to each other have not been reported so far. To address this issue the antimicrobial activities of these agents against 18 germs relevant to vaginal infections were determined. The tested species are representatives of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Listeria, Escherichia, Proteus, Gardnerella, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Candida, and Trichomonas. All micro-organisms were susceptible to dequalinium chloride with the exception of Proteus mirabilis. At a given dose, the activity of dequalinium chloride was higher as compared to the other substances. In view of its wide antimicrobial spectrum dequalinium chloride is an efficient alternative in the local therapy of vaginal infections such as fluor vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis, vulvo-vaginal candidiasis and trichomoniasis.
TI  - Characterization and selection of vaginal Lactobacillus strains for the preparation of vaginal tablets.
AB  - AIMS: To characterize and select Lactobacillus strains for properties that would  make them a good alternative to the use of antibiotics to treat human vaginal infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten Lactobacillus strains belonging to four different Lactobacillus species were analysed for properties relating to mucosal colonization or microbial antagonism (adhesion to human epithelial cells, hydrogen peroxide production, antimicrobial activity towards Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans and coaggregation with pathogens). The involvement of electrostatic interactions and the influence of bacterial metabolic state in the binding of lactobacilli to the cell surface were also studied. Adherence to epithelial cells varied greatly among the Lactobacillus species and among different strains belonging to the same Lactobacillus species. The reduction in surface negative electric charge promoted the binding of several Lactobacillus strains to the cell membrane whereas lyophilization reduced the adhesion capacity of many isolates. The antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli culture supernatant fluids was not directly related to the production of H2O2. CONCLUSIONS: Three strains (Lactobacillus brevis CD2, Lact. salivarius FV2 and Lact. gasseri MB335) showed optimal properties and were, therefore, selected for the preparation of vaginal tablets. The selected strains adhered to epithelial cells displacing vaginal pathogens; they produced high levels of H2O2, coaggregated with pathogens and inhibited the growth of G. vaginalis. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The dosage formulation developed in this study appears to be a good candidate for the probiotic prophylaxis and treatment of human vaginal infections.
TI  - Vaginal hydrolytic enzymes, immunoglobulin A against Gardnerella vaginalis toxin, and risk of early preterm birth among women in preterm labor with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the microbial hydrolytic enzymes, sialidase and prolidase, and immunoglobulin A against the Gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin (anti-Gvh IgA) increase the risk for early preterm birth (< or =34 weeks of gestation) among women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate flora. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred eighteen afebrile women in preterm labor with intact membranes had a vaginal Gram stain performed, and sialidase, prolidase, and anti-Gvh IgA concentrations were determined. RESULTS: Women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate flora had significantly higher sialidase and prolidase concentrations than women with normal flora. Among women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate flora, the women with sialidase had a higher rate of early preterm birth (P =.05). Sialidase had a sensitivity of 43% and specificity of 77% for early preterm birth. Prolidase and anti-Gvh IgA did not predict early preterm birth. CONCLUSION: Women in preterm labor with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate flora and detectable sialidase are at increased risk of early preterm birth.
TI  - [Sexually transmitted infections].
AB  - Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are quite common and observed more frequently in teens. The adolescents represent a group at particular risk for STD due to biological, sociocultural and psychological factors. Undectected infections may lead to unwanted sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic abdominal pain, tubal scarring and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. This paper deals with infections by Candida albicans, Chlamidia tracomatis, Neisseria gonorrheae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Treponema pallidum, Tricomonas vaginalis, Herpes simplex, Papilloma virus. In regard to gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and papilloma virus, the expectation is that improved detection will decrease sequelae by early diagnosis and treatment. Prevention programs (information, use of hormonal contraception associated with condom use) and improved access to STD diagnosis and treatment services are useful to reduce the incidence of STD among young people.
TI  - Douching in relation to bacterial vaginosis, lactobacilli, and facultative bacteria in the vagina.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study how frequency, recentness, and reason for douching impact bacterial vaginosis-related vaginal microflora and the occurrence of cervical pathogens. Douching has been linked to bacterial vaginosis as well as to chlamydial cervicitis in some, but not all, studies. METHODS: A total of 1200 women at high risk for sexually transmitted infections were enrolled from five clinical sites around the United States. Cross-sectional, structured interviews were conducted and vaginal swabs were self-obtained for Gram stain, culture, and DNA amplification tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS: Douching at least once per month was associated with an increased frequency of bacterial vaginosis. Those who douched recently (within 7 days) were at highest risk [odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3, 3.1]. Douching for symptoms (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1, 2.6) and for hygiene (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0, 1.9) both related to bacterial vaginosis risk. The associations between douching and Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and lack of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli were similar to those between douching and bacterial vaginosis. Gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis was not associated with douching. CONCLUSION: Douching for symptoms or hygiene, particularly frequent or recent douching, was associated with bacterial vaginosis and bacterial vaginosis-associated vaginal microflora, but not with gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis.
TI  - A multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic method for bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic method for bacterial vaginosis using bacterial vaginosis-associated anaerobes. METHODS: A multiple PCR assay was developed using primers specific to 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Mobiluncus mulieris and Mobiluncus curtisii), nanH (Bacteroides fragilis), and an internal spacer region of ribosomal DNA (Gardnerella vaginalis). The vaginal swabs from pregnant and nonpregnant women were examined by Gram stain-based Nugent scoring system. One hundred seventy-two samples of 853 Gram stain-interpretable samples were randomly selected and subjected to multiplex PCR assay. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the PCR assay ranged from 10 to 10 colony-forming units per vaginal swab. The prevalence of the bacterial vaginosis, intermediate, and normal categories was found by Nugent scoring system to be 21.6% (184/853), 26.0% (222/853), and 52.4% (447/853), respectively. By the multiplex PCR-based diagnostic method, 20.3% (35/172) of the samples were identified as bacterial vaginosis. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of multiplex PCR in comparison with Gram stain examination were 78.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.1%, 91.6%), 95.6% (95% CI 92.1%, 99.0%), 82.9% (95% CI 70.4%, 95.4%), and 94.2% (95% CI 90.3%, 98.1%), respectively. CONCLUSION: This multiplex PCR can be used as a diagnostic or screening test for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia in a premature neonate.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is a normal component of the human vaginal flora and commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis. Invasive infection in obstetrical patients due to G. vaginalis has also been reported. In the pediatric age range, infection due to G. vaginalis is extremely rare and limited to neonates. We describe a 23-week premature infant with G. vaginalis bacteremia and review the characteristics of neonatal G. vaginalis infection reported in the literature. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of G. vaginalis isolates has shown that penicillin, ampicillin, erthromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin are effective in vitro.

TI  - Anogenital bacteriology in non-abused preschool children: a descriptive study of  the aerobic genital flora and the isolation of anogenital Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The purpose of the study is to describe the genital aerobic bacterial flora including Gardnerella vaginalis in girls and the occurrence of anal G. vaginalis in both genders. From a group of 3773 children, 278 (99 boys and 179 girls) with a mean age of 5.63 y (range: 5.13-6.73) were recruited. Inclusion in the study was based on self-selection, whereby parents who did not suspect any occurrence of sexual abuse of their child gave informed consent to participate. Several mechanisms were undertaken to exclude abused children. At least one bacterial species was isolated from the genitals of 59 (33.9%) girls. Most isolates (39 out of 99) were bacteria representing skin flora (staphylococci and coryneform organisms), with viridans streptococci and related organisms as the second most common group of isolates (31 out of 99). S. anginosus was the single most frequent bacterial species identified (17 isolates). Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from the genitals of two girls, Streptococcus pneumoniae from one girl and Haemophilus influenzae from eight girls. G. vaginalis was not isolated from the genitals in any girl, but the organism was isolated from the anal canal in three children.
TI  - Safety and tolerability of the new contraceptive sponge Protectaid.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of two different-dose regimens of the Protectaid contraceptive sponge. METHODS: The toxic effects of two forms of the new vaginal contraceptive sponge, Protectaid, in the cervical and vaginal tissues were studied. Both types were impregnated with F-5 gel containing different doses of nonoxynol-9 (NX9; 0.5% and 0.125%). The sponge was used by 35 women aged 20-35 years (mean 28.7 years) randomly allocated into two groups (Group A: 0.5% NX9, n = 20; Group B: 0.125% NX9, n = 15). RESULTS: During a 12-month period both regimens demonstrated a 91.4% overall contraceptive efficacy. Colposcopic examinations showed no significant cervical or vaginal lesions in either group, except for two cases at the 2-week and 3-month examinations in Group A women. In the former, inflammatory changes of little clinical significance were seen and the colposcopic appearance of the vagina was non-specific. In this case, the focal lesions were accompanied by dilated capillaries (hyperemia). In the second case, degenerative inflammatory changes, with the inflammatory foci varying in shape and distribution, were observed. Cervical cultures taken 6 months after the start of treatment showed the presence of Mycoplasma hominis and Candida albicans in one and two cases, respectively, in Group A. In Group B, cervical cultures taken at 3 months showed Gardnerella vaginalis and beta-hemolytic streptococci group B in one and two cases, respectively. CONCLUSION: The potent spermicidal and protective properties of this new contraceptive sponge may be of benefit to the sexually active female. Since the sponge was very well accepted by both the study participants and their sexual partners, it can be considered as a valuable barrier method.

TI  - Vaginal microbiota in healthy pregnant women and prenatal screening of group B streptococci (GBS).
AB  - The microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. Isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. As expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). Enterobacteriaceae, mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. Candida albicans was present in 10% of healthy pregnant woman assayed. Streptoccocci (Streptococcus sp. and Enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci beta-hemolytic, GBS) was detected in 7% of the samples. GBS infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Furthermore, GBS was often co-isolated with C. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. A complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as GBS, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.
TI  - Improving Gram-stained reproducible result by further adding clue cells in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The reproducibility of interpretation in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis may be enhanced by adding pus cells and clue cells into two different criteria, developed by Spiegel et al. and Nugent et al. The purpose of study was designed to find out which parameter was more reproducible. 100 patients were collected with the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as an experimental group, while the other 100 patients who were with routine Papanicolaou smears in gynecologic clinic the collected as a control group. Two slides, including the original and reproducible ones, were obtained from vaginal smears for each patient. Three technicians read the slides randomly by using two different criteria, plus pus cells and clue cells. This showed the agreement for clue cells is the best method regardless of experimental group or control group (Kappa values between 0.708 and 1.000). The intra-observer agreement for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by the method of Nugent et al. is superior to the method of Spiegel et al. Our data show the comparison of Amsel criteria versus Nugent criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 55.4%, negative positive value of 62.1%, and positive predictive value of 85.8%. Moreover, our data also demonstrate the comparison of Amsel criteria versus the diagnosis either based on Nugent criteria or the presence of clue cells with sensitivity of 95.7%, specificity of 56.7%, negative positive value of 81.2%, and positive predictive value of 87.1%. The results demonstrate further adding score of the clue cells can enhance the reproducible diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which is superior to the methods of Nugent et al. and Spiegel et al.
TI  - DNA hybridization test: rapid diagnostic tool for excluding bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women with symptoms suggestive of infection.
AB  - This prospective comparative study evaluated a DNA hybridization test (Affirm VPIII) as an alternative to Gram stain for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. We examined vaginal smears from 1,725 pregnant women between the 12th and 36th weeks of gestation with clinical signs of vaginal infection. The DNA hybridization test compared well with Gram stain and can be used as a rapid diagnostic tool to exclude bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Correlation of local interleukin-1beta levels with specific IgA response against  Gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - PROBLEM: Mucosal immune system activation may represent a critical determinant of adverse sequelae correlated with bacterial vaginosis, as HIV sexual transmission, upper genital tract infections, cervicitis, endometritis, postsurgical infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes as preterm delivery (PTD), low birth weight (LBW). METHOD OF STUDY: Levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), anti-Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin (Gvh) IgA, pH, Nugent score, and number of leukocytes were measured in vaginal fluids of 60 fertile women with bacterial vaginosis and of 64 healthy controls. RESULTS: Vaginal IL-1beta levels were nearly 13-fold higher in women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and were associated with anti-Gvh IgA response. IL-1beta was positively correlated with leukocyte counts in the smear both in healthy and bacterial vaginosis positive women. CONCLUSIONS: Induction of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta may be a necessary event to elicit an innate immune response to control anaerobic genital tract infections. High levels of vaginal IL-1beta are associated with mounting of an antigen-specific mucosal immune response in women with bacterial vaginosis. Parallel induction of innate and adaptive immune response may be associated with protection from ascent of micro-organisms to the upper genital tract, and from acquiring viral infection through the vaginal tract.
TI  - Six-year follow-up survey of sexually transmitted diseases in Brasilia, the Capital of Brazil.
AB  - The notification of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) is a prime component of well-designed public health policy. However, peculiar aspects of STD must be taken into account for the correct management of surveillance activities. Here, we describe the distribution of the most common sexually transmitted diseases among patients attended by the gynecological clinics of the principal public hospitals of Brasilia and the Federal District, Brazilian capital, during six years. A total of 142,158 patients had their cervicovaginal samples collected for Papanicolaou preparations and eventual biopsies. Diagnosis was made according to cytological and histological alterations, distinguishing among vaginal infections, and pre-cancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. We also looked at the annual prevalence of the various types of infections and alterations. There was a high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis and candidiasis, with suggestive changes over the years. Pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions increased 2.2 fold during the six years. A large proportion of the cases involved late stages of cervical cancer, indicating the necessity of prompt attendance of the population in a routine gynecological prevention program.
TI  - Two novel vaginal microbicides (polystyrene sulfonate and cellulose sulfate) inhibit Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This is the first report demonstrating the in vitro inhibitory activity of two novel microbicides (cellulose sulfate and polystyrene sulfonate) against bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria. Vaginal application of these microbicides not only may reduce the risk of acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted infection-causing organisms but may also decrease the incidence of BV.
TI  - Rates of bacterial vaginosis in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation for different types of infertility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the rate of bacterial vaginosis (BV) is higher in women with tubal factor infertility compared with those with other causes of infertility. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Assisted conception unit of a teaching hospital in Leeds. POPULATION: Consecutive women undergoing in vitro fertilisation. METHODS: Women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) had a vaginal smear taken at the time of their egg collection. The smear was Gram-stained and graded as normal, intermediate or BV. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of bacterial vaginosis and the causes of infertility. RESULTS: A total of 749 women were included. The vaginal smears were normal in 63.6%, intermediate in 12.1%, and BV in 24.3%. The rates of BV in women with different types of infertility were 36.4% in tubal factor, 15.6% in male factor, 33.3% in anovulation, 12.5% in endometriosis and 18.9% in unexplained infertility. After controlling for the effects of age and smoking using a multivariate logistic regression model, women with tubal infertility were significantly more likely to have BV than women with endometriosis OR 3.63 (95% CI 1.52-8.67); male factor OR 2.98 (95% CI 1.80-4.90); and unexplained infertility OR 2.20 (95% CI 1.35-3.59). The adjusted figures for the increase of BV in women with anovulation were: endometriosis OR 3.77 (95% CI 1.28-11.08); male factor OR 3.09 (95% CI 1.37-6.96); and unexplained infertility OR 2.29 (95% CI 1.02-5.12). CONCLUSIONS: Women with tubal infertility were three times more likely to have BV than women with endometriosis, male factor or unexplained infertility. These findings support the association between BV, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and tubal damage but do not help distinguish between cause and effect. Women with anovulation were also three times more likely to have BV than women with endometriosis or male factor infertility, supporting suggestions of hormonal influence on vaginal flora.
TI  - [Cervicovaginal infection as a risk factor for premature labor].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the possible association between cervicovaginal infections (CVI) and preterm delivery. DESIGN: Cohorts. REFERENCE FRAME: Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, Hospital Central Militar and Hospital General Regional No. 1, IMSS, Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. PATIENTS: Four hundred and sixty eight patients attending prenatal control and delivery care. INTERVENTIONS: Fresh smears, Gram stain, and cervicovaginal sample culture from samples obtained during the following gestational stages: First sample at 16-24 weeks, second sample at 25-32 weeks, and third sample at 33-42 weeks. The following microorganisms were studied: Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Streptococcus agalactiae, Mycoplasma hominis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis. In case of a positive culture, the specific treatment was indicated. MEASUREMENTS: Positive or negative culture for each of the studied pathogens, and the presence or absence of a preterm delivery for each of the patients included in the study. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety eight were still present at the end of the study, of which 156 had a CVI and 242 had no CVI. No differences between both groups were observed concerning preterm delivery. Significant relative risks were: In the first stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis with RR = 9.0 (6.81, 11.8); in the second stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 6.2 (3.30, 11.7) and Escherichia coli with RR = 3.4 (1.33, 8.6); in the third stage, Ureaplasma urealyticum with RR = 9.19 (6.93, 12.1). The logistic regression analysis identified Ureaplasma urealyticum during the second stage with OR = 16.6 (2.9, 93.7), statistically significant with p = 0.001. The survival analysis showed differences between the two groups concerning pregnancy duration (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a difference in the duration in pregnancy in patients with CVI and without CVI. Ureaplasma urealyticum is consistently associated with preterm delivery.
TI  - Correlation of local interleukin-8 with immunoglobulin A against Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin and with prolidase and sialidase levels in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Mucosal immune system activation may represent a critical determinant of adverse  consequences associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), such as sexual human immunodeficiency virus transmission, upper genital tract infections, postsurgical infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Concentrations of sialidase, prolidase, and anti-Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin (Gvh) immunoglobulin A (IgA) were higher in vaginal fluids of 75 fertile women with BV, compared with concentrations in vaginal fluids of 85 healthy control subjects. Interleukin (IL)-8 levels were positively associated with anti-Gvh IgA response and inversely correlated with high levels of prolidase and sialidase in women with BV. IL-8 concentration was strongly associated with leukocyte count in both healthy and BV-positive women. The absence of leukocytes in most women with BV likely is due to lack of IL-8 induction. Parallel impairment of innate and adaptive mucosal immune factors, likely through microbial hydrolytic effects, may allow for the ascent of microorganisms to the upper genital tract and may facilitate viral infections.
TI  - Characterization of vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis in women who have sex with women.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) may be common among women who report having sex with women (WSW) and frequently occurs in both members of monogamous couples. The results of Gram staining of a vaginal smear were consistent with BV in 81 (25%) and intermediate in 37 (11%) of 326 WSW included in this study. Lactobacilli were detected in 64% of subjects, and 42% of subjects had H(2)O(2)-producing strains. BV was associated with a higher lifetime number of female sex partners, failure to always clean an insertive sex toy before use, and oral-anal sex with female partners. Neither recent douching nor sexual practices with male partners were associated with BV. Vaginal smears from each partner were concordant in 55 (95%) of 58 monogamous couples; BV was present in both partners in 16 couples (28%) (P<.001, compared with expected distribution). BV was common among subjects who did not douche, who did not have concurrent sex with male partners, or who did not have a new sex partner, which suggests that other risk factors for BV exist. These data support the hypothesis that sexual exchange of vaginal secretions is a possible mechanism for acquisition of BV.
TI  - [Frequency of vaginosis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  
TI  - Models of white matter injury: comparison of infectious, hypoxic-ischemic, and excitotoxic insults.
AB  - White matter damage (WMD) in preterm neonates is strongly associated with adverse outcome. The etiology of white matter injury is not known but clinical data suggest that ischemia-reperfusion and/or infection-inflammation are important factors. Furthermore, antenatal infection seems to be an important risk factor for brain injury in term infants. In order to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of WMD and to better understand how infectious agents may affect the vulnerability of the immature brain to injury, numerous novel animal models have been developed over the past decade. WMD can be induced by antenatal or postnatal administration of microbes (E. coli or Gardnerella vaginalis), virus (border disease virus) or bacterial products (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Alternatively, various hypoperfusion paradigms or administration of excitatory amino acid receptor agonists (excitotoxicity models) can be used. Irrespective of which insult is utilized, the maturational age of the CNS and choice of species seem critical. Generally, lesions with similarity to human WMD, with respect to distribution and morphological characteristics, are easier to induce in gyrencephalic species (rabbits, dogs, cats and sheep) than in rodents. Recently, however, models have been developed in rats (PND 1-7), using either bilateral carotid occlusion or combined hypoxia-ischemia, that produce predominantly white matter lesions. LPS is the infectious agent most often used to produce WMD in immature dogs, cats, or fetal sheep. The mechanism whereby LPS induces brain injury is not completely understood but involves activation of toll-like receptor 4 on immune cells with initiation of a generalized inflammatory response resulting in systemic hypoglycemia, perturbation of coagulation, cerebral hypoperfusion, and activation of inflammatory cells in the CNS. LPS and umbilical cord occlusion both produce WMD with quite similar distribution in 65% gestational sheep. The morphological appearance is different, however, with a more pronounced infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain and focal microglia/macrophage ("inflammatory WMD") in response to LPS compared to hypoperfusion evoking a more diffuse microglial response usually devoid of cellular infiltrates ("ischemic WMD"). Furthermore, low doses of LPS that by themselves have no adverse effects in 7-day-old rats (maturation corresponding to the near term human fetus), dramatically increase brain injury to a subsequent hypoxic-ischemic challenge, implicating that bacterial products can sensitize the immature CNS. Contrary to this finding, other bacterial agents like lipoteichoic acid were recently shown to induce tolerance of the immature brain suggesting that the innate immune system may respond differently to various ligands, which needs to be further explored.
TI  - A study to detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA in interstitial cystitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible role of Gardnerella vaginalis in interstitial cystitis (IC), using molecular methods to avoid difficulties with the culture and recovery of viable organisms, and the problems associated with the recovery of low numbers of culturable organisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three bladder biopsy samples (29 paraffin-embedded and four freshly frozen) from patients with IC, diagnosed according to National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases criteria, were assessed. Biopsy samples were used as urine samples may be contaminated by normal vaginal flora. A positive control comprised a 'normal' biopsy sample from a patient with a previous bladder tumour, seeded with G. vaginalis NCTC 10915. Microbial DNA was extracted from all paraffin-embedded and fresh specimens, and subjected to in vitro amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with G. vaginalis-specific primers. RESULTS: The anticipated PCR product of 333 base pairs was obtained with the positive control, whereas none of the other biopsy samples showed positive amplification specific for G. vaginalis. CONCLUSION: As there was no G. vaginalis DNA in any of the samples from patients with IC, it is an unlikely candidate in the pathogenesis of IC.
TI  - Definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. SAMPLE: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. METHODS: Samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). RESULTS: Genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. Group B streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. Vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. Also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. CONCLUSION: Aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group B streptococci and E. coli. Its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. The most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. In theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.
TI  - In vitro antagonistic effect of Lactobacillus on organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Antagonistic activity of different Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. The activity was tested against test organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Prevotella bivia. RESULTS: Many of the 146 Lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as S aureus and E coli, and a marked number of Lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as Gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes P anaerobius and P bivia. Only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of E faecalis and S agalactiae. Indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. The specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus strains taken from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. The specific occurrence rates of active Lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.
TI  - Vaginal microflora in healthy women with Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - In order to find the vaginal prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in a normal female population, we determined the incidence of G. vaginalis in relation to that of other bacterial genera and species in the vagina. Two-hundred and thirty-nine healthy women were the subjects of this study. Vaginal discharge was collected and bacteriological studies were performed. The mean total aerobe count in the G. vaginalis-positive group was 9.02 log10 colony-forming units (CFU)/g, which was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than that (6.80 log10 CFU/g) in the G. vaginalis-negative group. In contrast, there was no difference in the mean total anaerobe count between the two groups of subjects (8.82 and 8.24 log10 CFU/g, respectively in the case of including Lactobacillus species count). Also, the mean pH level of vaginal secretion in the G. vaginalis-positive group was 4.58, which was significantly higher (P < 0.005) than that (4.10) in the G. vaginalis-negative group. Aerobes were isolated at equal incidence in the two groups. Anaerobes were isolated at a significantly higher rate in the G. vaginalis-positive group (P < 0.005) than in the G. vaginalis-negative group. The mean count of Lactobacillus species was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in the G. vaginalis-negative group than in the positive counterpart (7.02 vs 8.66). Elevation of vaginal pH, an increase in the anaerobe count, and decreases in the Lactobacillus species count could be good predictors of the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in healthy women.
TI  - Intravaginal bacterial flora in patients with uterine cervical cancer. High incidence of detection of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Gynecological diseases may affect the growth of vaginal bacterial flora. We investigated the relationship between uterine cervical cancer and the vaginal bacterial flora. In 20 patients with uterine cervical cancer, we investigated the intravaginal bacterial flora, including Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. In the patients with uterine cervical cancer, there was a mixed flora of aerobes and anaerobes and, of special note, G. vaginalis was detected in 50% of the patients with uterine cervical cancer (10/20). Bacterial vaginosis was present in 8 of these 10 patients (80%). The count of G. vaginalis detected was higher than that of the other coexisting species and was higher in both pre- and postmenopausal patients with uterine cervical cancer than in a control group of pre- and postmenopausal women with benign gynecological diseases. In contrast, none of Mobiluncus spp. was detected. G. vaginalis was detected at a high incidence in patients with uterine cervical cancer, suggesting that the lesions of uterine cervical cancer provide favorable conditions for the growth of G. vaginalis and anaerobes, which leads to bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Frequency of Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida sp and Gardnerella vaginalis in cervical-vaginal smears in four different decades.
AB  - CONTEXT: Vaginitis is one of the principal motives that lead women to seek out an obstetrician or gynecologist. Bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and trichomoniasis are responsible for 90% of the cases of infectious vaginitis. OBJECTIVE: To verify the frequency of the three main causative agents of vaginitis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida sp and Gardnerella vaginalis, in four different decades (1960's, 1970's, 1980's and 1990's). DESIGN: Retrospective. PLACE: A tertiary referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Patients attended to as gynecology and obstetrics outpatients at the Faculdade de Medicina do Triangulo Mineiro during the years 1968, 1978, 1988, 1998, taken as samples of each decade. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Diagnoses of infection by Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida sp and Gardnerella vaginalis were gathered from 20,356 cervical-vaginal cytology tests on patients attended to as gynecology outpatients at Faculdade de Medicina do Triangulo Mineiro during the years 1968, 1978, 1988, 1998, representing the four decades. The results were grouped according to the age group of the patients: under 20, between 20 and 29, between 30 and 39, between 40 and 49, and 50 or over. Statistical analysis was done via the chi-squared (Mantel-Haentzel) test with a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: In 1968 infections by Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida sp were diagnosed in 10% and 0.5% of the cytology tests and in 1978, 5.1% and 17.3%, respectively (P < 0.0001). Infection by Gardnerella vaginalis could only be evaluated in the latter two decades. In 1988, 19.8% of the women had positive tests for Gardnerella vaginalis, which was the most frequent agent in that year, diminishing in the subsequent decade to 15.9% (P < 0.0001). Candidiasis was the most frequent infection in 1998, detected in 22.5% of the tests (P < 0.0001). In a general manner, all the infections were most frequent among younger patients, especially those aged under 20, in all decades, whereas infections were least frequent among patients aged 50 or over (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was a reduction in the frequency of cervical-vaginal infection by Trichomonas vaginalis and an increase in the frequency of Candida sp over the four decades studied. All the infections were most frequent in patients aged under 20 years.
TI  - Gluteal necrotizing myofascitis: an unusual delayed complication of abdominal sacrocolpopexy.
AB  - Persistent low back pain developed in a 51-year-old woman after she had undergone abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Four months postoperatively, necrotizing myofascitis developed in her gluteal muscles. The infected mesh, which had eroded into the vagina, was removed. Cultures of the infected mesh and abscesses grew common vaginal flora, including Gardnerella vaginalis and Actinomyces.
TI  - Bacteriocin susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and metronidazole susceptibility.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the bacteriocin susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole. STUDY DESIGN: Bacteriocin susceptibility of 36 G vaginalis clinical isolates was tested against a vaginal strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus by a growth-inhibition method. The relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole were analyzed by the chi2 test and Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Eight G vaginalis strains (22%) were bacteriocin-resistant. Biotypes 5 and 7 were found to be the most frequent among these resistant strains. Eight (42%) of the 19 isolates classified as biotype 5, 6, or 7 were bacteriocin-resistant compared with none of the isolates that were classified as other biotypes (P <.01). Biotype 5 was found in higher prevalence among the isolates resistant to bacteriocin (62%) than among the susceptible isolates (14%) (P =.01). Genotype B was found more frequently among the bacteriocin-resistant strains, but this finding was not statistically significant (P =.71). Seven (88%) bacteriocin-resistant strains were also resistant to metronidazole. CONCLUSION: An association between biotype and an increased resistance to bacteriocin was found. The ability of G vaginalis to resist the antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus bacteriocin may be a pivotal factor in understanding bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - New approach to phylogenetic analysis of the genus Bifidobacterium based on partial HSP60 gene sequences.
AB  - The partial 60 kDa heat-shock protein (HSP60) genes of 36 Bifidobacterium strains representing 30 different Bifidobacterium species and subspecies and of the type strain of Gardnerella vaginalis were cloned and sequenced using a pair of universal degenerate HSP60 PCR primers. The HSP60 DNA sequence similarities were determined for the taxa at various ranks as follows: 99.4-100% within the same species, 96% at the subspecies level, and 73-96% (mean 85%) at the interspecies level (and 98% in the case of two groups of closely related species, Bifidobacterium animalis and Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium suis, whose 165 rRNA sequence similarities are all above 99%). The HSP60 DNA sequence similarities between different Bifidobacterium species and G. vaginalis, a closely related bacterium according to 16S rRNA analysis, ranged from 71 to 79% (mean 75%). Although the topology of the phylogenetic tree constructed using the HSP60 sequences determined was basically similar to that for 16S rRNA, it seemed to be more clear-cut for species delineation, and the clustering was better correlated with the DNA base composition (mol% G+C) than that of the 16S rRNA tree. In the HSP60 phylogenetic tree, all of the high-G+C (55-67 mol%) bifidobacteria were grouped into one cluster, whereas the low-G+C species Bifidobacterium inopinatum (45 mol %) formed a separate cluster with G. vaginalis (42 mol%) and Bifidobacterium denticolens (55 mol%); a Bifidobacterium species of intermediate G+C content formed another cluster between the two. This study demonstrates that the highly conserved and ubiquitous HSP60 gene is an accurate and convenient tool for phylogenetic analysis of the genus Bifidobacterium.
TI  - [Frequency of Gardnerella vaginalis vaginosis and its association with other pathogens causing genital infections in the female].
AB  - In order to determine the presence of unspecific vaginosis and their causes, 700  vaginal smears were obtained from patients assisting to the Clinical Laboratory of the Familiar Medicine Unit No. 28 "Gabriel Mancera" of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, during 6 months. The patients age was from 18 to 55 years old. To establish the infectious etiology of these pathologies the vaginal smears were observed freshly and stained by Gram's method. Specific test for differentiate Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans were also performed. From 700 vaginal smears, 160 were positive to Candida albicans (22.86%); 150 to Gardnerella vaginalis (21.43%); and 14 to Trichomonas vaginalis (2%). The most frequent association were Candida albicans with Gardnerella vaginalis in 14 women, who 12 had a reduced number of pregnancy, and 7 had only one pregnancy (58.3%). The age groups most affected were between 18 and 35 years old, corresponding to the reproductive stage of the woman. Gardnerella vaginalis predominated in the 30-35 years old group.
TI  - Relationship of abnormal vaginal flora, proinflammatory cytokines and idiopathic  infertility in women undergoing IVF.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and abnormal bacterial vaginal flora in an infertile population and correlate with cervical cytokine production and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. STUDY DESIGN: In a blinded study, 331 asymptomatic IVF patients were evaluated for BV, abnormal vaginal flora and cervical cytokine production (interleukin 1 beta [IL-1 beta] and IL-8) on the day of oocyte retrieval. All patients received tetracycline prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval. RESULTS: BV was identified in 4.2% (14/331) of the patients. Patients with idiopathic infertility were more likely to have BV than were women with other causes of infertility (P = .02 vs. male factor, P = .03 vs. tubal factor and P < .01 vs. endometriosis-associated infertility). Patients with abnormal vaginal flora had higher cervical IL-1 beta and IL-8 cytokine levels as compared to patients with normal vaginal flora. IL-1 beta and IL-8 levels in the study subjects correlated highly. No differences were detected in IVF outcome parameters based on the vaginal flora determined at the time of retrieval. CONCLUSION: Abnormal vaginal flora, including that causing BV, is associated with elevated cervical levels of IL-1 beta and IL-8. The induction of proinflammatory cytokines by an altered vaginal ecosystem may be a previously unrecognized cause of idiopathic infertility.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from patients with bacterial vaginosis and from patients with healthy vaginal ecosystems.
AB  - The differences in the phenotype and genotype of Gardnerella vaginalis isolates from patients with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and from patients without BV are unknown. In our study, 43 isolates of G. vaginalis were examined for biotype (hippurate hydrolysis, lipase, and beta-galactosidase activity), sensitivity to metronidazole, and genotype. Of the 117 women visiting the gynecology clinic at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center who were included in the study, 27.4% were found to have BV. G. vaginalis was found in samples from 87.5% of women with BV, from 34.0% of women with intermediate BV, and from 26.4% of women with healthy vaginal ecosystems. Among patients with G. vaginalis, biotypes 7 and 8 were isolated from 32% and 20% of patients, respectively. Biotype 5 was predominantly associated with a healthy vaginal ecosystem (P=.0004). Biotypes 5 and 7 were the most resistant to metronidazole. No specific phenotype or genotype of G. vaginalis causes BV.
TI  - Evaluation of the Affirm Ambient Temperature Transport System for the detection and identification of Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Candida species from vaginal fluid specimens.
AB  - The objective of this study was to measure the performance of the Affirm Ambient  Temperature Transport System (ATTS) over time and to estimate the length of time the system can preserve a vaginal specimen containing the three common organisms causing vaginitis: Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, and Gardnerella vaginalis (one of the causative agents of bacterial vaginosis). Women with symptoms of vaginitis presenting to one of three clinical centers were evaluated over a 4- to 8-week period. Four simultaneously obtained swabs were collected and tested by the Affirm VPIII assay at time zero with and without a preservative reagent, at 24 h with reagent, and at either 48 or 72 h with reagent. For each of the three organisms, Trichomonas, Gardnerella, and Candida, positivity at each time point was evaluated and compared to that at reference time zero with and without the ATTS. A total of 940 specimens were obtained from the three clinical sites. Eight hundred three were positive for one or more of the three organisms. Gardnerella had the highest overall positive rate (62%), followed by Candida with 18% and Trichomonas at 9%. The percent sensitivity versus control for Trichomonas ranged from 100% at time zero with and without reagent to 91% by 72 h. Gardnerella and Candida sensitivity remained at 100% for each time period. The Affirm VPIII ATTS system performed within 10% of the control swab (no transport reagent) at all four time points (0, 24, 48, and 72 h) for Trichomonas, Gardnerella, and Candida.
TI  - Defense factors of vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antagonistic relationship between vaginal lactobacilli and endogenous vaginal microflora. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-two Lactobacillus strains were studied for the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocin. RESULTS: Under standardized growth conditions, most strains increased their biomass by more than 4 times. Lactobacillus species grew best at a pH > or = 4.5, and growth was retarded at a pH < 4.5. Lactic acid levels were 0.68 to 2.518 mg/mL and were not related to the number of cells or the pH of media. The pH of the media was caused by the secretion of lactic and other organic acids. Approximately 80% of the strains produced H(2)O(2) and were graded as 2+ in one third of the strains and 1+ in others. No statistical correlation was found between H(2)O(2) lactic acid and bacteriocin production. Bacteriocin activity was tested on 4 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Approximately 80% of the lactobacilli tested produced bacteriocin that inhibited growth of G vaginalis. Six of the strains did not produce bacteriocin. Thirteen strains produced all 3 defense factors, whereas the others lacked 1 or 2 properties. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus species grow best at a pH > 4.5. The pH of the media is dependent on the cell mass and on all organic acids produced by Lactobacillus species. Although all species produce organic acids, not all produce H(2)O(2) and bacteriocin. Not all strains of G vaginalis can be inhibited by lactobacilli-producing bacteriocin.
TI  - Nugent score related to vaginal culture in pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To relate Gram-stained smears, using the Nugent criteria, to quantitative and qualitative vaginal cultures in pregnant women. METHODS: Two independent evaluators using the Nugent criteria, a standardized method of Gram-stain interpretation designed to detect bacterial vaginosis, scored 104 vaginal smears from pregnant women. The quantitative and qualitative vaginal cultures were assessed at the same time and the results expressed as log(10) colony-forming units per gram of vaginal secretion. The Nugent scores were compared with the microbiologic findings. RESULTS: The prevalence of normal, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis vaginal flora as determined by Gram stain was 68%, 21%, and 11%, respectively. A comparison of the mean bacterial counts with the Nugent score showed a weak negative correlation for Lactobacillus species and a positive correlation for gram-variable and gram-negative rods. Additional analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the mean bacterial counts analyses of Peptostreptococcus, a genus not included in the Nugent scoring system, and the Nugent score. In addition, the Prevotella counts correlated strongly with both the Nugent score and the Peptostreptococcus counts. The quantitative counts for Lactobacillus did not vary significantly among the three defined groups of vaginal microflora; however, significant increases in the concentrations of Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella were found as the Nugent score increased. CONCLUSION: A strong correlation was found among the gram-variable and gram-negative genera comprised by the Nugent score. Peptostreptococcus also correlated strongly with the Nugent score and with the Prevotella counts, suggesting that this genus may play a role in determining vaginal health.
TI  - Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 stimulatory activity by Gardnerella vaginalis: relationship to biotypes and other pathogenic characteristics.
AB  - Stimulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 expression by Gardnerella vaginalis is one possible cause for an increase in the amount of virus in the genital tract. The ability of G. vaginalis to induce HIV expression in chronically infected U1 cells was investigated, along with its possible relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole and bacteriocin. Significant HIV stimulatory activity was found in 5 (50%) lysates of G. vaginalis. The ability to induce HIV expression in U1 cells was statistically associated with G. vaginalis biotype (P=.048) but not with genotype or resistance to metronidazole and bacteriocin. Further studies to explore the in vivo relevance of HIV activation by G. vaginalis in the female genital tract are warranted, since prevention strategies of bacterial vaginosis and colonization by certain biotypes of G. vaginalis may be valuable in reducing the risk of sexual transmission of HIV.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis among a group of married Jordanian women: occurrence and laboratory diagnosis.
AB  - A total of 310 vaginal swabs collected from a group of married Jordanian women complaining of vaginal discharge were examined for bacterial vaginosis. The scoring system of Nugent for the interpretation of Gram staining was employed. This system revealed the presence of the condition in 29.7% of patients. Results obtained using the scoring system correlated significantly with the detection of clue cells and the scarcity of white blood cells in the vaginal discharge. An inverse relationship was found between bacterial vaginosis and Lactobacillus morphotypes determined by Gram staining. No definite relationship was detected between bacterial vaginosis and the recovery of Gardnerella vaginalis by culture as this organism was isolated from swabs which according to the Nugent criterion were negative for bacterial vaginosis. Bacterial vaginosis among the women investigated was more prevalent than vaginitis caused by Trichomonas vaginalis or yeasts.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein produced by vaginal Lactobacillus acidophilus that inhibits Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate bacteriocin from a vaginal strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus. METHODS: L. acidophilus 160 was grown on two media. The first was MRS broth for 18 hours; the cells were harvested, washed, and placed into a chemically defined medium. The second medium resembled vaginal fluid minus protein. Bacteriocin was precipitated from both media using ammonium sulfate. The growth-inhibiting activity of bacteriocin was determined by a bioassay using nine different isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. RESULTS: MRS broth is not a suitable medium for extracting bacteriocin, because it binds with Tween 80. Bacteriocin was isolated, without contaminating constituents, from chemically defined medium and identified as a single band by electrophoresis. Bacteriocin has a molecular weight of 3.8 kDa. All nine isolates of Gardnerella were inhibited by the bacteriocin isolated from L. acidophilus 160. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteriocin produced by L. acidophilus 160 was isolated from the chemically defined medium (starvation medium) in a partially pure form. L. acidophilus 160 bacteriocin inhibited growth of all nine isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis.
TI  - Vaginal microflora associated with bacterial vaginosis in nonpregnant women: reliability of sialidase detection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria and Mycoplasma hominis in vaginal specimens of women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) as well as to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the direct sialidase assay of vaginal fluid as a rapid test for diagnosing this syndrome. METHODS: Vaginal cultures were obtained from 109 nonpregnant women (mean age 33 +/- 7.1 years), 47 of them with clinical signs of BV (BV+) and 62 of them without BV (BV-). In addition, we determined the vaginal sialidase activity in both groups, which may serve as a feature of this syndrome. RESULTS: Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 91% and 18% of the BV+ and BV- groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella bivia and Porphyromonas spp. were strongly associated with BV. P. bivia and Prevotella spp. represented 44% of all the anaerobes isolated in the BV+ group. All the isolated P. bivia strains presented sialidase activity. G. vaginalis and M. hominis were isolated in 76% and 42% of the BV+ and 1% and 0% of the BV- women, respectively (p < 0.001). Mobiluncus morphotypes were observed in 34% of the BV+ and 0% of BV- women. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of sialidase activity were 81%, 94%, 90% and 86%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a strong association between G. vaginalis, M. hominis, and P. bivia and BV. Sialidase activity and Gram stain of vaginal fluid represent accurate methods for diagnosing BV.
TI  - [Complications of sexually transmitted diseases: clinical course and treatment].
AB  - Sexually transmitted infectious agents cause a wide array of complications in the short-, medium-, and long-term, especially among women. Specifically, infection with these agents can result in sterility, infertility, genital neoplasia, pre-term delivery, and foetal/neonatal pathologies, and the agents most commonly associated with these complications are: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, anaerobic bacteria, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis and human papilloma virus (HPV), which is involved in the etiology of squamous genital carcinomas. This report describes several of the mechanisms involved in the damage to genital and reproductive organs, focussing on those mechanisms involved in the damage caused by delayed autoimmune response.
TI  - The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and vaginal flora changes.
AB  - In a population of 956 women, attending for contraceptive advice, 131 (13.7%) were found to have BV acording to Amsel's criteria. Clue cells were detected in 200 (20.9%) women, a positive amine ('sniff') test in 191 (20.0%), a vaginal pH > or = 4.7 in 243 (25.4%) and a "characteristic" vaginal discharge in 104 (10.9%) women. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values in relation to BV were calculated for each of these four criteria. The detection of clue cells, an increased pH and a positive sniff test showed excellent sensitivity (86-100%) values, but had a less satisfactory positive predictive value (52-68%). Vaginal discharge was found to be a poor predictor of BV. The vaginal flora in women with clue cells, increased vaginal pH or a positive sniff test was very similar to that of the women with BV, every after excluding concomitant cases of BV and the three respective criteria. Thus, a positive amine test, which is easily performed, strongly suggests BV and a vaginal flora predominated by Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus species and anaerobic species on one hand, and lack of lactobacilli on the other. When there is a clinical suspicion of BV, the sniff test is positive and differential diagnoses are excluded, one can safely treat a woman for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Clarithromycin-induced alterations in vaginal flora.
AB  - Many antibiotics have been shown to alter both the bacterial and the fungal flora of the vagina, in some cases potentially increasing a woman's propensity toward urinary tract infections and vaginal candidiasis. The effects of some of the newer macrolide antibiotics on women's vaginal flora have not been previously studied, and almost none of the previous studies specifically cultured for effects on vaginal lactobacillus. Young women (ages 18-45 years) who were about to go onto therapy with clarithromycin, who did not have any conditions known to affect the vaginal flora (eg, diabetes mellitus, spermicide use, menopausal status without hormone replacement therapy), and who agreed to participate in the study were cultured with aerobic and anaerobic and fungal vaginal cultures before starting the antibiotic. These same women were then retested about 4 to 6 weeks after the start of their antibiotic course, and the results of their preantibiotic and postantibiotic cultures were compared. Lactobacillus was present in 33% of patients by vaginal culture before treatment, but this decreased to 0% after treatment. Escherichia coli was present in only 8% of patients before treatment, but this increased to 17% of patients after treatment. Enterococcus was present in 25% of patients before treatment but in only 8% of patients after treatment. The incidence of Gardnerella vaginalis was not affected by the treatment. Candida species incidence increased from 17% to 33% with treatment. The overall effects of clarithromycin on the vaginal flora are similar to other older antibiotics that have been tested.
TI  - Binding of heme by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - It has been previously demonstrated that Gardnerella vaginalis could acquire iron from a number of different iron-containing compounds, including heme. In this study, the direct binding of heme by G. vaginalis strains was demonstrated utilizing a liquid broth heme-binding assay. Competition studies demonstrated that pretreatment of G. vaginalis cells with other iron sources such as hemoglobin, catalase, and lactoferrin did not affect heme binding. Also, heme binding was not inhibited by preincubation of G. vaginalis cells with protoporphyrin IX. Two potential heme-binding proteins with estimated molecular weights of 30 and 70 kDa were isolated using heme-agarose batch affinity chromatography.
TI  - Predictors of the vaginal microflora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to define influences on the patterns of the vaginal microflora. STUDY DESIGN: We enrolled 617 African American and Mexican American women in a 1-year longitudinal study of sexual behaviors and the vaginal microflora on the basis of the presence of gonorrhea, chlamydial infection, trichomoniasis, or syphilis at the initial visit. The patients were assigned randomly to a behavioral intervention or standard counseling regarding sexually transmitted disease. We reevaluated 508 (82%) and 549 (89%) women at 6 and 12 months, respectively. A comprehensive survey of lower genital tract organisms was conducted at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Behavioral and microbiologic associations were screened by bivariate analysis. All variables associated with an organism at P < or = .15 were included in a multivariate analysis. Associations between behavior and the genital tract microflora were identified by logistic regression coefficients with P <.05. RESULTS: African American race had a consistent association with vaginal microflora, specifically, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, group B streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Various behaviors had a less consistent effect, including multiple partners, douching, frequency of coitus >3 times a week, and cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse at the last sexual encounter. M hominis (but not Ureaplasma urealyticum ), Gardnerella vaginalis, and Lactobacillus species were associated with bacterial vaginosis. Lactobacillus species appeared to protect against bacterial vaginosis and infection with G vaginalis. Sexually transmitted diseases (caused by M hominis, N gonorrhoeae, C trachomatis, and T vaginalis ) were associated with each other. In contrast, hormonal status, vaginal blood, and foreign bodies had little effect. CONCLUSION: The presence of other microorganisms and race have a more consistent association with the presence or absence of a cervical-vaginal organism than sexual behavior, hormonal status, vaginal devices, or the presence of abnormal vaginal bleeding.
TI  - Aerobic microbiological study in term pregnant women with premature rupture of the membranes: a case-control study.
AB  - To determine the aerobic microorganisms related to premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) in term pregnant women, a case-controlled study was performed on pregnant women delivered at Rajavithi Hospital between November 1, 1996 and July 30, 1997. Two hundred and twenty pregnant women with PROM and 220 pregnant women without PROM were recruited by simple random sampling. The diagnosis of rupture of the membrane was made by history and by positive microscopic ferning and pH testing performed during speculum examination. The demographic characteristics were not statistically significantly different between both groups. We could not isolate any organisms (35.9% in the study group and 49.5% in the control group). Candida albicans and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the only two significant differences demonstrated between the study and control group (p<0.05). Candida albicans, the most prevalent organism in the study group, demonstrated significant difference between the study and control group (14.5% and 7.7% respectively) (p<0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrated significant difference between the study and control group (7.30% and 4.10% respectively) (p<0.05). Gardnerella vaginalis, the most prevalent organism in the control group, showed no significant difference between the control and study group (16.40% and 14.10% respectively) (p=0.547).
TI  - Detection of cervical immunoglobulin A in normal pregnancy.
AB  - The aim of our study was to evaluate a feasible method to quantify the immunoglobulin A concentration in the cervical mucus of women with a normal singleton pregnancy. In 60 immunologic healthy pregnant women cervical mucus samples were taken at a random time in pregnancy using an absorbing cylindrical cotton-swab stick. In this cervical mucus immunoglobulin A concentration was measured by radial immunodiffusion. A vaginal bacterial swab was taken from each woman. Concentration of immunoglobulins in maternal serum was estimated. There was no statistically significant difference of cervical immunoglobulin A concentration between the investigated groups (p = 0.952): 18-24 gestational weeks (gw): 52.8 (6.6-258.4) mg/l; 25-29 gw: 89.3 (4.8-193.8) mg/l; 30-34 gw: 55 (1.4-326) mg/l; 35-40 gw: 59.2 (4-400.9) mg/l. Women with a normal vaginal flora showed a significantly higher cervical immunoglobulin A concentration than those with a pathological colonization: 92.2 (6.6-400.9) mg/l vs. 42.5 (1.4-326) mg/l (p < 0.05). The serum levels of immunoglobulins A, A1, A2, M and G do not correlate to cervical immunoglobulin A levels nor to gestational age. In normal pregnancy, cervical immunoglobulin A concentration does not change with advancing gestational age, but a pathological vaginal colonization seems to be associated with decreased immunoglobulin A levels.
TI  - Understanding the bacterial flora of the female genital tract.
AB  - The microbiological flora of the lower female genital tract provides a dynamic, complex example of microbial colonization, the regulation of which is not fully understood. When an exogenous bacterial species, with its array of virulence factors, is introduced into the host, disease does not always occur. Conversely, under selected conditions, commensal endogenous bacteria-for example, Gardnerella vaginalis and group B streptococci-can participate in disease processes. Disease caused by both exogenous and endogenous bacteria correlates positively with a markedly increased level of bacterial replication. The key question is what determines the quantity of a given bacterium at any given time. For disease to occur, exogenous or endogenous bacteria that possess pathogenic prerequisites must attain replicative dominance. Their ability to do so is potentially governed by inhibitory or synergistic interrelationships with other microbes.
TI  - Modern methods for diagnosis of Gardnerella infection.
AB  - Comparison of morphological, bacteriological, serological, and genetic methods for diagnosis of Gardnerella infection in vaginosis showed that the first three methods are preferable, while the genetic method (polymerase chain reaction) is more efficient for identification of Gardnerella vaginalis in culture.
TI  - A study on the possible association of dysfunctional uterine bleeding with bacterial vaginosis, mycoplasma, ureaplasma, and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  
TI  - Identification of a Gardnerella vaginalis hemoglobin-binding protein.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that Gardnerella vaginalis can utilize human hemoglobin as a sole source of iron. In this study, the interaction between human hemoglobin and G. vaginalis cells was investigated. With a solid phase dot blot assay, G. vaginalis cells were shown to bind digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled human hemoglobin. A human hemoglobin-binding protein with an estimated molecular weight of 124 kilodaltons (kDa) was detected by Western blot analysis of G. vaginalis proteins. The hemoglobin-binding activity of this protein was found to be heat stable and was observed in G. vaginalis cells grown under iron-restrictive and iron-replete conditions. The 124-kDa hemoglobin-binding protein was not detected from intact G. vaginalis cells treated with trypsin prior to Western blot analysis, suggesting that this protein was surface exposed.
TI  - [Maternal-fetal infection with Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  
TI  - [The production of a latex immunoglobulin conjugate for the diagnosis of Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - To obtain an anti-Gadnerella vaginalis latex globulin, specific immunosera to reference strain (ATCC 14018) and to a clinical isolation strain pool were produced. These immunosera were characterized using PAGE-SDS and immunoblotting where a close antigenic relation between the clinical isolation strains and the reference strain was observed. The latex globulin conjugates obtained from these 2 immunosera were evaluated in vitro with a resulting level of detection of 10 ufc/mL of Gardnerella vaginalis. These two conjugates were also evaluated in clinical samples and compared with the 6 vaginalis culture and the criteria considered for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. The anti-strain pool (II) latex globulin conjugate turned out to be more sensitive and specific than anti-G. vaginalis ATCC strain (I) latex globulin.
TI  - Detection of Gardnerella vaginalis in the vagina and amniotic fluid using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  
TI  - Adverse obstetric sequelae of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is increasingly associated with adverse sequelae in obstetrics such as preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, preterm labour and preterm birth. It is important to diagnose the condition early in pregnancy where appropriate treatment can be administered to women who are symptomatic or who are at high risk of adverse sequelae.
TI  - Inhibition of chemotaxis by organic acids from anaerobes may prevent a purulent response in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - It has been postulated that certain organic acids produced by the anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) could prevent a purulent response in this infection. Varying concentrations of pure succinic, acetic and lactic acids were incubated in vitro with a monocytic cell line (MonoMac 6). High inhibition of chemotaxis was produced by succinic acid; lower inhibition and no inhibition was shown by acetic acid and lactic acid respectively. Succinic and acetic acids were detected in high concentrations in the vaginal fluid of women with BV and in culture supernates of Prevotella and Mobiluncus spp.; these acids impaired chemotaxis of MonoMac 6 cells in vitro. The vaginal fluids of normal women and the culture supernates of Lactobacillus spp. had no effect on chemotaxis.
TI  - Conservation in probiotic preparations of Lactobacillus with inhibitory capacity  on other species.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus isolated from dairy products and genital tract competed  with Candida albicans through a membrane of 12000 dalton cut-off. This inhibition was due to hydrogen peroxide and was trypsin-stable, heat-sensitive and antagonized by catalase. Lactobacillus coming from "starters" showed antimicrobial activity against fungus isolated in a yogurt factory. Penicillium, Alternaria, Phialophora, Microsporum and Candida spp. were inhibited when 10(2) spores were inoculated in the assay. No inhibition was observed with 10(5) spores. Besides, one of 21 Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women inhibited pathogenic bacteria by means a bacteriocin trypsin-sensitive, heat-stable and retained by dialysis membrane. Tablets for future probiotic use were prepared and the viability of bacteria was assayed using media with different compositions. Pharmaceutical preparations with polyethyleneglycol was the best formulation for the Lactobacillus viability, the counts remained between 10(7) and 10(6) cfu/tablet for up to 1 year.
TI  - [Verification of identification of infectious agents by culture in routine gynecologic cytological screening].
AB  - The original Bethesda classification system for reporting cervical/vaginal cytologic diagnoses has claimed besides oncologic evaluation also a statement on the presence of infectious agents. Their diagnosis should be followed by appropriate treatment. Based upon the comparison of careful bacterioscopic study in a series of 175 routine cervical smears with the results of microbiological, virological and mycological examinations the following pathogens might be-according to the authors' opinion-diagnosed as highly possible and recommended for laboratory verification: cocci, Gardnerella vaginalis, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Morganella Morgani, Candida, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis and human papilloma virus.
TI  - Binding of catalase by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Previous work has demonstrated that Gardnerella vaginalis can utilize catalase as a sole source of iron. In this study, the interaction between G. vaginalis cells and catalase was investigated. G. vaginalis cells were shown to bind digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled catalase using a solid phase dot blot assay. An increase in catalase binding was observed from cells grown under iron-restrictive conditions. Western blot analysis of G. vaginalis proteins resulted in the detection of a putative catalase-binding protein with an estimated molecular mass of 128 kDa. The 128-kDa catalase-binding protein was not detected from intact G. vaginalis cells treated with trypsin prior to Western blot analysis suggesting this protein may be surface-exposed.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vaginitis, affecting over 3 million women in the United States annually. Depopulation of lactobacilli from the normal vaginal flora and overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobic species are the presumed etiology. To date, no scientific evidence shows that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. Malodorous vaginal discharge is the most common symptom. Differential diagnoses include trichomoniasis, moniliasis, and allergic or chemical dermatitis. The diagnosis is confirmed when at least three of the following four findings are present (Amsel's criteria): 1) thin, homogenous discharge, 2) pH greater than 4.5, 3) positive amine test, and 4) presence of clue cells. The sensitivity and positive predictive value are both 90%. Vaginal Gram stain is also reliable and allows for permanent record. Cultures are nonspecific because G. vaginalis resides in normal vaginal flora as well. Papanicolaou smears are not particularly sensitive, but their positive predictive value is very high. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend three treatment regimens in nonpregnant patients: oral metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), intravaginal 2% clindamycin cream (one applicatorful at bedtime for 7 days), or intravaginal metronidazole gel (one to two applicatorfuls per day for 5 days). Alternative regimens include a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole or a 7-day course of oral clindamycin, 300 mg twice daily. The association between bacterial vaginosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes has satisfied many criteria for a causal inference. Treatment of bacterial vaginosis in women with previous history of preterm labor results in fewer preterm deliveries than in untreated women from the same population.
TI  - Role of the male partner in the lower genitourinary tract infection of female.
AB  - We studied the relationships of selected microbes and the role of consorts in the causation of vaginal discharge which may be due to cervicitis or vaginitis. A total of 93 consecutive patients in the reproductive age group with symptoms of vaginal discharge along with their sexual partners were studied. Samples were collected from the cervix and posterior fornix of the female patients and from the urethra and sub-prepucial area of the male partner for culture of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma, candida, aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Apart from cultures, KOH and Gram stain of the discharge were made. Predominant pathogen isolated was Ureaplasma urealyticum from 40 (43.01%) females and 23 (24.7%) males. The next common pathogenic organisms isolated were candida species from 11 (11.8%) females and 5 (5.4%) males and Chlamydia trachomatis in 3 (3.2%) females and 1 (1.1%) male. Various organisms were more frequently isolated from the 29 of 43 (67.4%) couples who had had sexual intercourse 7 days prior to the recruitment as compared to 14 of 43 (32.6%) who had had coitus more than 7 days prior to their recruitment. This may be due to the spontaneous disappearance or decrease in the number of organisms to the level that they could be detected by culture. In our study, 6 (6.5%) of male partners carrying pathogenic organisms were asymptomatic, indicating that their screening and treatment is vital.
TI  - Association of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum with some indicators of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the isolation rates of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum from three populations of women and also to relate the presence of these microorganisms with some indicators of nonspecific vaginitis. Three hundred vaginal swabs were taken from delivery, pregnant and control (not pregnant) women. Cultures were done in E broth supplemented with arginine or urea. M. hominis was isolated in 5% at delivery, 12% from pregnant and 5% from control women and U. urealyticum was isolated in 21%, 31% and 28% respectively. There was statistical difference in the isolation rate of M. hominis in pregnant women respect to the other groups. Both microorganisms were more frequently isolated in women with acid vaginal pH, amine-like odor in KOH test, clue cells and leucorrhea. M. hominis was isolated in 17% and U. urealyticum in 52% from women with nonspecific vaginitis. M. hominis was isolated in 2% and U. urealyticum in 13% from women without nonspecific vaginitis. Although the presence of clue cells and amine-like odor in KOH test have relationship with Gardnerella vaginalis, these tests could also suggest the presence of these mycoplasmas.
TI  - [The treatment of bacterial vaginosis with Dalacin V cream].
AB  - To asses the efficiency of the 2% clindamycin phosphate creme given in 3 and 7 daily courses officially designer for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). METHODS: The study includes 65 patients who have microbiological data for BV 11 of the women are pregnant (18.46%). The microbiological study includes there agent: Streptococcus agalactiae, E. colli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, Staphylococcus epidermidis et Enterococcus fecalis. The controls visit was assessed on the 7'] and 28'] day after the therapy. RESULTS: There were successful results on the 84.3% of the patients after 7 day course but in the 3-day course the good results were showed in 73.91% of the women. After the 28"] day there were only few successful results 43%. CONCLUSIONS: The clindamycin phosphate is more preferable method for the treatment of BV.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was first reported in 1995 by Gardner and Dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. They also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "Haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed Gardnerella vaginalis. BV is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. BV has a complex microbiology. Lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes G. vaginalis, anaerobic Gram-negative rods such as Prevotella species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. Those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome, raising the vaginal pH and producing a discharge odor. The excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". Nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. Results from epidemiologic studies have associated BV with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. In particular, the presence of BV in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that BV is a cause of preterm delivery. The interest in potential invasiveness of G. vaginalis has increased. However, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. The most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.
TI  - Symptomatic bacteriuria due to Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma in adults.
AB  - 314 women, and 52 men were screened during 18 months, for the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in a midstream specimens of urine. All the patients were adults with symptoms of urinary tract infection who consulted a physician at a Primary Health Center "Jose Castro Villagrana" in Tlalpan, D.F. Mexico. Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated in 54 (17.1%) of the women and 8 (15.4%) of the men. Only Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis were isolated more frequently in both groups, 36.6% and 25.4%, respectively in women and 58.5% and 30.8% in men Mycoplasma hominis was isolated in 12 (3.8%) in women and 4 (7.7%) in men. The bacteriuria due to fastidious bacteria or Ureaplasmas that is not detected by routine culture methods are relatively common and would not necessarily respond to antibiotic treatment for conventional urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis. Epidemiology and risk factors].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a change in vaginal ecosystem where lactobacilli dominate, flora is absent or greatly reduced, and replaced with a mixed, predominantly anaerobic flora, consisting of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Mobiluncus spp, Bacteroides spp, Prevotela spp, Peptostreptococcus spp, Fusobacterium spp and Porphyromonas spp. The concentration of bacteria increases from 100 to 1000 fold in women with BV compared to healthy women. BV has been formerly known as nonspecific vaginitis, Haemophilus vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis and anaerobic vaginintis. BV is the most prevalent form of vaginal disturbances in reproductive age women. The average incidence of BV varies: 10-35% in patients visiting gynaecological wards, 10-30% in patients visiting obstetric wards and 20-60% in patients visiting services of sexually transmitted diseases. A typical clinical symptom of BV is malodorous vaginal discharge. However, more than 50% of all women with BV are asymptomatic. BV has been associated with many gynaecological and obstetric complications such as cervicitis, salpingitis, endometritis, postoperative infections, urinary tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, mild abnormal Pap smear results and possible link with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, preterm delivery, premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis and postpartum endometritis. Factors that increase the risk of BV are multiple partners, exposure to semen, prior trichomoniasis, intrauterine device usage, smoking, indigent population and frequent use of scented soap. Diagnosis of BV is established by Amsel's criteria of which three of four are the following: presence of homogeneous discharge, vaginal fluid pH > 4.5, positive amine test and microscopic analysis of Gram stained smear of vaginal discharge where "clue" cells (epithelial vaginal cells covered with mass of adherent bacteria, mostly coccobacilli) should be detected. The treatment of patients with BV consist of metronidazole or clindamycin, per os or intravaginally. The treatment of asymptomatic women and male sex partners of women with BV is controversial. The aim of the study was to establish the occurrence rate of BV in our women and potential factors increasing the risk of BV. We examined 166 women at the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, University School of Medicine, Belgrade. Diagnosis of BV was established by Amsel's criteria. Each woman filled in a special questionnaire. Pregnant women were excluded. BV was diagnosed in 25% (33/166) of women. BV was more common among women with multiple partners. The most prevalent clinical symptom of BV was malodorous vaginal discharge. Vaginal symptoms became more evident after intercourse. Taking into consideration the occurrence rate of BV and its connection with numerous gynaecological and obstetric sequelae, and taking into account that the diagnosis of BV is quick, simple and inexpensive, we suggest that the examination of BV in women becomes a usual procedure.
TI  - [Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis in the diagnosis of sexual abuse in children].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The study of sexual transmitted diseases is more and more frequent  in patient with suspicion of sexual abuse, and this help to the final medical diagnosis. Organisms like Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Treponema indicate a sure sexual contact. However the role of the rest of organisms in the sexual abuse is more difficult of specifying. OBJECTIVE: To know the role of the Gardnerella vaginalis in the diagnosis of sexual abuse in patient with this possible diagnosis. METHODS: Retrospective study of 135 girls with suspicion of abuse, visited from May of 1997 to February of 1998. Vaginal swabs were taken from 45 of 135 girls evaluated. RESULTS: In five patients the vaginal culture were positive to Gardnerella. The characteristics of these five patients are described (age, aggressor, type and duration of the abuse, physical exploration and final diagnosis). All our patients were the pubertal or prepubertal girls. In these patients the final diagnosis settled with the clinical history and the physical exploration, without keeping in mind the result of the culture. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to discard sexual abuse in all prepubertal girl with a positive culture with Gardnerella vaginalis, being difficult to specify the value of the Gardnerella in the adolescent patients.
TI  - Incidence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida sp and human papilloma virus in cytological smears.
AB  - CONTEXT: In spite of the wide-ranging literature on the microbiology of normal and abnormal flora of the vagina, there are few studies on the relationship between human papilloma virus (HPV) and other vaginal microorganisms. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the frequency of infection by human papilloma virus (HPV) and other agents like Candida sp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Trichomonas vaginalis in cytological smears. DESIGN STUDY: Retrospective study SETTING: A public tertiary referral center. SAMPLE: An analysis of 17,391 cytologies from outpatients seen between January 1997 and August 1998. The control group was made up of patients in the same age group and same period with no cytological evidence of HPV infection. Patients with a diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II or III were excluded from this analysis. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The diagnosis of HPV infection was made in accordance with the criteria of Schneider et al. and the diagnosis of Gardnerella vaginalis was made with a finding of clue cells. RESULTS: 390 (2. 24%) had alterations consistent with infection by HPV, sometimes associated with CIN I. The results showed that Gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequent agent in women with HPV infection (23.6% versus 17.4%; P <0.05), while in the control group the most frequent agent was Candida sp. (23.9% versus 13.8%; p <0.001). CONCLUSION: In spite of this study being based solely on cytological criteria, in which specific HPV and Gardnerella diagnostic tests were not used, the cytological smear is widely used in clinical practice and the data presented in this investigation show that there is an association between Gardnerella vaginalis and HPV infection. It remains to be established whether the microorganisms favor each other.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [The antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  - The antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (B. adolescentis 2 F1, B. longum Z4, B. breve R2 and B. bifidum G1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to Escherichia coli, Klebsiella ozaenae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. Still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. B. adolescentis strain 2 F1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. In contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with B. breve R2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to E. coli. The data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
TI  - Characterisation and selection of a Lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of Lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. BV has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. A total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. The characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent BV, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). Four strains of lactobacilli, L. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), L. crispatus (55730) and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest inhibitory activity against the BV-associated bacterial species. Two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced H2O2. All four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (pH <4). Only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to VEC (>100 bacteria/VEC). A further isolate (L. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against BV-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of H2O2 and was also highly adherent to VEC. Isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.
TI  - Identification of a human lactoferrin-binding protein in Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that Gardnerella vaginalis can utilize iron-loaded human lactoferrin as a sole source of iron. In this study, G. vaginalis cells were shown to bind digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled human lactoferrin in a dot blot assay. Using the DIG-labeled human lactoferrin, a 120-kDa human lactoferrin-binding protein was detected by Western blot analysis of G. vaginalis proteins. The lactoferrin-binding activity of this protein was found to be heat stable. Competition studies indicated that this binding activity was specific for human lactoferrin. Treatment of G. vaginalis cells with proteases suggested that this protein was surface exposed. An increase in lactoferrin binding by the 120-kDa protein was observed in G. vaginalis cells grown under iron-restrictive conditions, suggesting that this activity may be iron regulated.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis represents a unique upheaval of the complex vaginal bacterial flora with disappearance of lactobacilli and overgrowth of Gardnerella vaginalis and resident anaerobic vaginal bacteria. Little progress has occurred in identifying causal factors, although the pathophysiology of this syndrome is better understood. Although symptoms are easily recognizable, obstetric and gynecologic complications continue to increase in number. Bacterial vaginosis is far more than a nuisance infection. Problems with diagnosis continue to dominate clinical practice, although new tests have been introduced. Therapeutic options have increased, although recurrent disease remains common, and management of this common complication constitutes a major challenge.
TI  - Pathogenesis of abnormal vaginal bacterial flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine the relationships between microscopy findings on wet mounts, such as lactobacillary grade or vaginal leukocytosis, and results of vaginal culture, lactate and succinate content of the vagina, and levels of selected cytokines. STUDY DESIGN: In a population of 631 unselected women seeking treatment at an obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic, vaginal fluid was obtained by wooden Ayre spatula for wet mounting and pH measurement, by high vaginal swab for culture, and by standardized vaginal rinsing with 2 mL 0.9% sodium chloride solution for measurements of lactate, succinate, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 8, leukemia inhibitory factor, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations. Lactate and succinate levels were measured by gas-liquid chromatography and the cytokine concentrations were measured by specific immunoassays. Both univariate analysis (Student t test, Welch test, chi(2) test, and Fisher exact test) and multivariate regression analysis (Cox analysis) were used. RESULTS: Increasing disturbance of the lactobacillary flora (lactobacillary grades I, IIa, IIb, and III) was highly correlated with the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, enterococci, group B streptococci, and Escherichia coli. Vaginal pH and interleukin 8 and interleukin 1beta concentrations increased linearly with increasing lactobacillary grade, whereas lactate concentrations and the presence of epithelial cell lysis decreased. A similar pattern of associations with increasing leukocyte count was clear, but in addition there was an increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. Multivariate analysis of vaginal leukocytosis, lactobacillary grades, and the presence of positive vaginal culture results showed that interleukin 1beta concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade, leukemia inhibitory factor concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade and positive culture results, interleukin 8 concentration was most closely related to positive culture results, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentration was most closely related to vaginal leukocytosis and positive culture results. The concentration ratio of interleukin 1beta to interleukin 1 receptor antagonist remained stable, except when vaginal leukocytosis increased. In its most severe form, with >10 leukocytes per epithelial cell present, a decompensation of the vaginal flora with a collapse in interleukin 1beta and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations was seen, but there was a concurrent sharp increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. This pattern was completely different from the course of the cytokine concentrations associated with a lactobacillary grade increase. CONCLUSION: Both disturbed lactobacillary grade and the presence of increasing vaginal leukocytosis were correlated with lactobacillary substrate (lactate) concentration, pH, and the concentrations of a variety of cytokines. There was a remarkably linear increase in these cytokines as either leukocytosis or lactobacillary grade became more severe. In circumstances in which leukocytosis was extreme, however, interleukin 1beta was no longer produced but leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations increased. We speculate that in extreme inflammation the body tries to limit the damage that can be done by exaggerated cytokine production.
TI  - [A multicenter study of the antimicrobial effect of Macmiror and Macmiror Complex in the treatment of vaginal infections].
AB  - The aim of the present multicentre study was to examine the therapeutic possibilities of the wide-spectrum medicament MACMIROR & MACMIROR COMPLEX for the treatment of the vaginal infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 159 nonpregnant women among 15 and 54 years (middle age 35.6) with different by kind and intensity colpitis complaints. The following microbiological characteristic was established: in 26 cases Gardnerella vaginalis, in 46 Candida spp., and in the rest 87-mixed aerobic bacterial flora, with a combination of Gardnerella, yeast and Trichomonas. The treatment of the patients was done in combined scheme: peroral and vaginal administration, simultaneously with local treatment of the partner. The control examination was performed bistagely: on 7-10 day and on 30-40 day. RESULTS: The good clinical and microbiological influence of the treated patients was established, for the first control examination the effect was found in 88.1% and 86.8% and for the second--respectively in 81.1% and 82.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The received results give us a cause to approve, that the combination "Nifuratel and Nystatin" (Macmiror & Macmimor complex) has the good possibilities to influence the mixed forms of vaginal infection.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by wet mount identification of bacterial morphotypes in vaginal fluid.
AB  - In order to develop a more practical way of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis (BV),  we evaluated a scoring system, weighting small bacterial morphotypes versus lactobacillary morphotypes in wet mounts, assessed criteria for BV and normalcy from this scoring, and then evaluated their reproducibility and accuracy. We examined 754 women for pH, homogeneous vaginal discharge, amine odour, clue cells and the composite clinical diagnosis. We also examined wet mounts for small bacterial morphotypes and lactobacillary morphotypes, and weighted their quantitative presence as a bacterial morphotype score. The term 'small bacterial morphotypes' denotes a group of small bacillary forms comprising coccobacilli, tiny rods, and mobile curved rods. The different characteristics of BV were all gradually associated with increased bacterial morphotype scoring. We deemed a score of 0-1 as normal, 2-4 as intermediate phase, grade I, 5-6 as intermediate phase, grade II, and 7-8 indicative of BV. Reproducibility of the interpretation was high, both for the new grading system (weighted Kappa 0.90 in women perceiving and 0.81 in women not perceiving abnormal vaginal discharge) and for the new criterion for BV (non-weighted Kappa 0.91 and 0.84 in the 2 groups of women). The new criterion also proved highly concurrent with the composite clinical diagnosis (Kappa 0.91 and 0.81 in the 2 groups). In conclusion, the wet mount bacterial morphotype scoring is valid for grading of the disorder of the vaginal microbial ecosystem, and the new criterion for BV a more practical option than existing diagnostic methods.

AB  - METHODS: A simple and reproducible proposed for Benito et al. scheme for identification biotypes of Gardnerella vaginalis has been developed, based on reactions for lipase, hippurate, hydrolysis, and beta-galactosidase. RESULTS: 11 biotypes were found among 130 strains from women with and without bacterial vaginosis (non-specific vaginitis) 1A, 5B; 8B, 5C, 8C, 1E, 6G and 7G in women with vaginosis and the biotypes 1A, 5B, 8B, 1C, 8F and 6H in women without vaginosis. These biotypes 1A; 5B and 8B were found in two groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that some biotypes of G. vaginalis are associated with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Characterization of the 16S rRNA gene V2 region and the rrn operons of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene polymorphism was apparent when Gardnerella vaginalis DNA restriction profiles were hybridized with nonradioactively labeled total rRNA isolated from this bacterium. In contrast, use of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based 16S rRNA gene V2 region resulted in a 118-bp V2-PCR amplicon that was specific and common in all 30 tested G. vaginalis isolates. In addition to providing a G. vaginalis-specific fingerprint, when the V2-PCR amplicon along with total rRNA were utilized as probes, a partial rRNA gene restriction map could be constructed. G. vaginalis contains two rrn operons with an EcoRI fragment of 1.6 kb common to both.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship of bacterial vaginosis and bacterial vaginosis-associated microorganisms with an HIV-inducing factor (HIF) found in cervicovaginal lavage. DESIGN: A total of 26 cervicovaginal lavage specimens collected from 17 women were used in this study to determine if HIF was significantly associated with features consistent with bacterial vaginosis. METHODS: Patients were evaluated for various clinical features including age, HIV status and stage, CD4 cell counts, clinical diagnosis of gynecological infections, vaginal pH, Gram stains of vaginal fluid, phase of menstruation, and presence of cervical dysplasia. Cervicovaginal lavage specimens were analyzed for the presence of HIF by U1 bioassay. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, and general Mycoplasmataceae, and specifically Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, M. fermentans, M. genitalium in cervicovaginal lavage were determined by semiquantitative PCR. RESULTS: Eleven cervicovaginal lavage samples from seven women were HIF-positive and 15 cervicovaginal lavage samples from 11 women were HIF-negative (patient No. 8 had two HIF-negative cervicovaginal lavage and one HIF-positive cervicovaginal lavage). The following parameters were significantly associated with HIF: abnormal vaginal fluid pH (>4.5) (P = 0.006), Gram stains indicative of bacterial vaginosis (P = 0.007), normal menstrual cycle (P = 0.0007) and PCR detection and relative quantity of M. hominis (P = 0.0003, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that HIF is closely associated with features of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  - Perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. During these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (pH approximately 4). This study was designed to test whether the characteristics of acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. Eight vaginal Lactobacillus isolates from four species-L. gasseri, L. vaginalis, L. crispatus, and L. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic pH (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the Lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (pH 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (B. Andersch, L. Forssman, K. Lincoln, and P. Torstensson, Gynecol. Obstet. Investig. 21:19-25, 1986; L. Cohen, Br. J. Vener. Dis. 45:241-246, 1969; J. Paavonen, Scand. J. Infect. Dis. Suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; C. Tevi-Benissan, L. Belec, M. Levy, V. Schneider-Fauveau, A. Si Mohamed, M.-C. Hallouin, M. Matta, and G. Gresenguet, Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). During exponential growth, all of these Lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. Such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (W. H. Masters and V. E. Johnson, Human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). During bacterial vaginosis (BV), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal pH rises to >4.5. This correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. Three BV-associated bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic pH (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal pH associated with BV. Together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: a review.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a clinically definable condition that is frequently diagnosed in the primary care setting. Changes in the nomenclature, causative microorganisms, as well as treatment have caused confusion over the last century. BV is currently viewed as a shift in the normal vaginal ecosystem from a predominance of aerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria (Soper, 1993), resulting in a malodorous discharge. However, more than one half of clinically diagnosed patients are asymptomatic. Recent evidence indicates that the anaerobes identified as components of BV have been implicated in obstetric complications, postoperative pelvic infections, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Practice issues resulting from this research include the appropriate treatment of asymptomatic women, especially in pregnancy. This article reviews BV from a historical perspective, provides a summary of recent research findings identifying BV as a possible risk factor in various serious medical conditions and their sequelae, and discusses related practice concerns resulting from the implications of these findings.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora isolated from the female genital tract  activates HIV-1 expression.
AB  - Alteration of cervicovaginal microbial flora can lead to vaginosis, which is associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. We recently characterized a soluble HIV-inducing factor (HIF) from the cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples of women. The goals of this study were to determine the effect of cervicovaginal microflora on HIV-1 expression and to elucidate the relationship between HIF activity and microflora. Physiologically relevant microorganisms, Mycoplasma, diphtheroid-like bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus constellatus, cultured from the CVL of a representative woman with a clinical condition of bacterial vaginosis and possessing HIF activity, induced HIV-1 expression. The magnitude of virus induction varied widely with the greatest stimulation induced by diphtheroid-like bacteria and Mycoplasma. The transcriptional induction by Mycoplasma was mediated by activation of the KB enhancer, an activation mechanism shared with HIF. Also as with HIF, Mycoplasma induced AP-1 dependent transcription. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based speciation showed that the isolate was M. hominis. Our data indicate that bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora can enhance HIV-1 transcription and replication and identify M. hominis as a potential source for HIF activity. The virus-enhancing activities associated with the microflora and HIF may increase genital tract viral load, potentially contributing to HIV transmission.
TI  - The effects of three nonoxynol-9 preparations on vaginal flora and epithelium.
AB  - To evaluate the effects of nonoxynol-9 (N-9) on the vaginal flora and epithelium, 48 women (16 in each group) were evaluated by use of quantitative vaginal cultures and colposcopy. at baseline and at 0.5, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after insertion of one of three N-9 preparations (4% gel [Conceptrol], 3.5% gel [Advantage-24], or a 28% vaginal contraceptive film). The proportion positive for H2O2+ or H2O2- lactobacilli did not change significantly with any of the preparations, but lactobacilli concentrations decreased transiently. Both the proportion of women with Gardnerella vaginalis and the concentration of G. vaginalis decreased transiently. The proportion of women with Escherichia coli increased with the 4% gel, and the concentration increased with all preparations. The number with anaerobic gram-negative rods increased, although the concentrations decreased. Symptoms and colposcopic abnormalities were rare. Changes in levels of vaginal bacteria were transient after single applications of N-9, but adverse effects may be enhanced with frequent, chronic use.
TI  - In vitro activities of pazufloxacin, a novel injectable quinolone, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  - T-3762 is an injectable new quinolone with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Pazufloxacin (T-3761) is an active form of T-3762. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pazufloxacin for 50% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.025 microg/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.78 microg/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6.25 microg/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 6.25 microg/ml for Bacteroides fragilis and 12.5 microg/ml for Prevotella bivia. The MICs of T-3762 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 3.13 microg/ml for S. agalactiae, 6.25 microg/ml for G. vaginalis, 0.10 microg/ml for E. coli, 12.5 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa, 25 microg/ml for P. magnus, 12.5 microg/ml for B. fragilis and 25 microg/ml for P. bivia. The results of this study suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, T-3762, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as an empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are an important cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) but have often not been detected in microbiological studies of Indian women admitted to hospital gynaecology wards or private clinics. In this cross sectional study, women living in the inner city of Mumbai (Bombay) were investigated for socioeconomic, clinical, and microbiological risk factors for PID. METHODS: Microbiological tests and laparoscopic examination were carried out on 2736 women aged < or = 35 years who came to a health facility with suspected acute salpingitis or infertility or for laparoscopic sterilisation. 86 women with a clinical diagnosis of PID were not referred for laparoscopy although their characteristics are described. Associations between various risk factors and PID status were investigated and logistic regression performed on all factors that remained significant. RESULTS: Of women with a laparoscopically confirmed evaluation, 26 women had acute and 48 chronic pelvic infection. Independent risk factors for PID were later age at menarche (> or = 14 years), a history of stillbirth and no previous pregnancy, history of tuberculosis, STD, dilatation and curettage or previous laparoscopy, and presence of Gardnerella vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that STD related risk factors applied to only a small proportion of PID cases and that other determinants of PID are important, including obstetric complications, invasive surgical procedures such as laparoscopy, and tuberculosis.
TI  - Activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1, and Gardnerella vaginalis is frequently isolated from the genital tracts of women with BV. G. vaginalis lysates were found to significantly stimulate HIV expression in monocytoid cells. Stimulation was significantly higher when lysates were heated at 100 degrees C for 5 min but was reduced by treatment with lysozyme or protease. G. vaginalis lysates also activated HIV expression in certain T cell lines. G. vaginalis lysates activated HIV long-terminal repeat transcription in HIV-infected cells and increased NF-kappaB binding activity, indicating an effect by G. vaginalis on HIV transcription. The activation of HIV production by G. vaginalis suggests that genital tract infection with G. vaginalis increases the risk of HIV transmission by increasing HIV expression in the genital tract. This may explain, at least in part, the increased rate of HIV transmission in women with BV.

TI  - Assessment of office-based care of sexually transmitted diseases and vaginitis and antibiotic decision-making by obstetrician-gynecologists.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Survey office-based obstetric-gynecologic practitioners regarding their knowledge of infectious disease care and antibiotic use. METHODS: A survey questionnaire of multiple-choice questions was mailed to Fellows of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists about clinical entities for which recommendations have undergone recent changes or about which there was a lack of consensus in a prior similar survey (Gibbs RS, McGregor JA, Mead PB, et al.: Obstet Gynecol 83:631-636, 1994). RESULTS: Respondents indicated that oral metronidazole was their most frequent choice to treat bacterial vaginosis. Ampicillin (57%) was used more often than penicillin (39%) for intrapartum group B streptococcus prophylaxis. Azithromycin was preferred (61%) over erythromycin-base (38%) for chlamydia treatment during pregnancy. There were several modes of practice that deviated from accepted care: 27% and 29% did not screen for chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively, in pregnancy; 17% used cultures for Gardnerella vaginalis to diagnose bacterial vaginosis; 25% considered quinolones to be safe in pregnancy; 93% felt metronidazole should never be used in pregnancy; and the majority (66%) would send a patient treated successfully for pelvic cellulitis home with an oral antibiotic. CONCLUSION: Respondents' infectious disease knowledge and practices in obstetrics and gynecology is appropriate in treating sexually transmitted diseases, bacterial vaginosis, and group B streptococcus. Numerous deficiencies still exist in screening for sexually transmitted diseases in pregnancy and diagnosing bacterial vaginosis, as well as in the choice of antibiotics to use or avoid for certain infections.
TI  - [Survey of sexually transmitted diseases in the region of Rio Cuarto].
AB  - Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are acquired mainly through sexual intercourse, being one of the most frequent groups of infectious diseases worldwide and consequently an important public health problem. The aim of this paper was to determine the current state of STD and to compare different diagnostic methods in the population studied. A total of 1060 samples from vaginal flows, endocervical material and urethral discharge were studied during 3 years. Of the total samples, 583 were positive, 493 in women and 90 in men. Microorganisms found in women were: Gardnerella vaginalis (39.3%), Candida albicans (21.1%), Trichomonas vaginalis (17.3%), Candida trachomatis (11.3%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (3.2%): Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urelyticum (6.5%) and Treponema pallidum (1.4%), the associations found were, Gardnerella vaginalis with Trichomonas vaginalis 5.5%; Gardnerella vaginalis with Candida albicans 4.9%; Trichomonas vaginalis with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2.2%) and Gardnerella vaginalis with Chlamydia trachomatis (1.9%). In men, gonococcal urethritis (UG) represented 37.7% non UG 55.6% and Treponema pallidum 6.7%. These results indicate a decrease in sifilis and in UG when compared to previous studies showing that gonococcal cervicitis had also decreased. We found an important increase in the prevalence of urethritis and non gonococcal cervicitis in agreement with world statistics which consider these diseases as the most common venereal ones. It is necessary to increase the search for Chlamydia trachomatis in pregnant women due to vertical transmission. It should be noted that, in spite of certain fluctuations, the incidence of the STD in our area is still unacceptably high.
TI  - Gram stain method shows better sensitivity than clinical criteria for detection of bacterial vaginosis in surveillance of pregnant, low-income women in a clinical setting.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to determine whether the Gram stain method is superior to the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in low-income pregnant women seen in a resident clinic setting. The clinical criteria is the current diagnostic method employed to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: In this study, 51 pregnant women with vaginal discharge were prospectively evaluated. All were screened using the clinical criteria, Gram stain method, and culture of the discharge. The modified scoring system instituted by Nugent et al. (J Clin Microbiol 29:297-301, 1991) was employed in reading the Gram stain smears. The clinical criteria were then compared with the Gram stain method. Isolation of moderate to many Gardnerella vaginalis growth by culture was used as the confirmatory finding. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the Gram stain method (91%) was significantly higher than that of the clinical criteria (46%), (sign test P = 0.0023, < 0.01). The Gram stain method also has both a low false-negative (4%) and high negative predictive value (96%), making it an ideal diagnostic test. CONCLUSION: The Gram stain method is a rapid and cost-effective test that is also highly reproducible and readily available in many laboratories. These features make the Gram stain method a more desirable screening procedure for bacterial vaginosis in a clinic population.
TI  - The growth of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus in Sorbarod biofilms.
AB  - Sorbarod biofilms were investigated for their suitability in establishing continuous culture biofilms for the study of bacterial vaginosis. Two important organisms in the condition, Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus, were studied. In contrast to growth in broth culture, both organisms were maintained for at least 96 h in a steady state on the biofilms. With G. vaginalis, the haemolytic activity was consistently maintained in the biofilms in contrast to short-term activity in broth culture which matched the bacterial titre. The simple Sorbarod system appears to be suitable for studying the growth conditions of bacteria in continuous culture and has potential for investigating interactions between micro-organisms.
TI  - [The treatment of vaginal infections with Macmiror and Macmiror Complex].
AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine the therapeutic possibilities of the  wide-spectrum medicament Macmiror & Macmiror Complex for the treatment of the vaginal infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 52 nonpregnant women among 20 u 54 years (middle age 30.5) with different by kind and intensity colpitis complains. The following microbiological characteristic was established: in 26 cases Candida spp., in 19 Gardnerella vaginalis, in 1 Trichomonas vaginalis and in the rest 6 mixed infection. The treatment of the patients was done in combined scheme: peroral and vaginal administration simultaneously with local treatment of the partner. The control examination was performed bistagely: on 7-10 day and on 30-40 day. RESULTS: The good clinical and microbiological influence of the treated patients was established for the first control examination the effect was found in 89.5% u 84.2% go of the cases with bacterial vaginosis and in 84.6% u 69.2% in those with mycotic colpitis. Relatively high values were found also at the second control, respectively 83.3% and 72.2% for the amine colpitis and 69.5% and 52.2% for vaginal candidosis. The similar favorable influence received also in the rest of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do show good possibilities of the nifuratel and nystatin combination (Macmiror & Macmiror complex) to influence vaginitis with different etiology, which give us founding to consider, that the drug is suitable for the mixed forms of vaginal infection.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of the genus Bifidobacterium and related genera based on 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - The 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined for type strains of 21 Bifidobacterium species. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the determined sequences and sequences from DNA databases, which contain the sequences of 11 type strains of Bifidobacterium species and 11 strains of related genera. All species of the genus Bifidobacterium and Gardnerella vaginalis ATCC 14018 belonged to a cluster phylogenetically distinct from the other genera. The cluster was divided into two subclusters: subcluster 1 composed of most species of Bifidobacterium and G. vaginalis, and subcluster 2 consisting of two species, B. denticolens and B. inopinatum; both of which were isolated from human dental caries. In the genus Bifidobacterium, four groups of species are known to be moderately to highly related by DNA-DNA hybridization. The four groups of species exhibited more than 99% similarity among their 16S rDNA sequences within each group. These results indicated that species with around 99% or more similarity in their 16S rDNA sequences should be confirmed for species identities.
TI  - Can a laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis be made from a transported high vaginal swab using anaerobic culture and microscopy of a wet preparation?
AB  
TI  - Relationship between maternal group B streptococcal colonization and pregnancy outcome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of maternal colonization with group B streptococcus (GBS) with preterm labor and premature rupture of the membranes (PROM). METHODS: Vaginal cultures were conducted in 615 women at 22-26 weeks' gestation and again on admission for term delivery, preterm labor, or PROM. Antibiotics were not given antenatally based on a GBS-positive culture result. Fisher exact test and maximum likelihood analysis were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The rates of preterm labor and PROM were not significantly different between GBS-positive and GBS-negative women in both the antenatal screening and the screening on admission. According to maximum-likelihood analyses, the known risk factors for preterm labor and PROM collectively were important risk factors for preterm labor (odds ratio: 6.48), but GBS colonization during pregnancy was not a risk factor for preterm labor or PROM. In the antenatal screening, the proportion of subjects with lactobacilli-reduced vaginal flora was significantly higher in GBS-positive women (14.3%; ten of 70) than in GBS-negative women (6.4%; 35 of 545) (P = 0.26). Bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes) were isolated in only 3.7% (23 of 615) of all subjects. CONCLUSION: Vaginal colonization with GBS was not associated with preterm labor and PROM in an obstetric population with a low incidence of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria, despite the presence of lactobacilli-reduced flora in GBS-positive women.
TI  - Impairment of the mucosal immune system: IgA and IgM cleavage detected in vaginal washings of a subgroup of patients with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The integrity of the immunoglobulins in vaginal washings of patients with bacterial vaginosis was examined to answer the question of the lack of immune response against Gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin. Clinically diagnosed patients (n=100) were recruited and their vaginal washings examined by Western blotting. Many showed IgA and IgM partially or extensively degraded. According to the degradation pattern, the patients were subdivided into 4 subsets, from intact (score 0) to completely degraded IgA (score +3). Statistical analysis of the data showed a correlation between IgA degradation and absence of immune response to G. vaginalis cytolysin. The extent of IgA degradation correlated also with the sialidase (but not with the prolidase) activity level. All women showed intact IgG and human serum albumin and no trypsin-like activity. Patients with bacterial vaginosis having high sialidase activity and extensive IgA degradation in their secretions could incur more dangerous infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - Prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in prepubertal males.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the rate of occurrence of Gardnerella vaginalis in the genital tract and rectum of the asymptomatic prepubertal boy and to examine the effect of circumcision on the rate of recovery. DESIGN: A prospective survey design was used. Cultures for G vaginalis were obtained from the urethral meatus, surrounding glans, and rectum of prepubertal boys. Boys who had a history of sexual abuse, current urogenital symptoms, or who had taken antibiotics in the preceding 2 weeks were excluded from this study. SETTING: The study was conducted in ambulatory clinical settings at a children's hospital within a major medical center that serves as a statewide referral center. PARTICIPANTS: A group of 99 circumcised and uncircumcised prepubertal boys participated in the study. The participants ranged in age from 1 month to 7 years 4 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Results of cultures for G vaginalis. RESULTS: No cultures were positive for G vaginalis from the urethra, glans, or rectum in any of the participants in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provide preliminary evidence that G vaginalis is not an organism that commonly colonizes the urogenital or gastrointestinal tract in asymptomatic prepubertal boys. Based on these findings, it does not seem prudent to apply the concept of asymptomatic colonization to prepubertal boys unless further studies refute these findings.
TI  - Cervical cytology in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - 398 symptomatic cases of vaginitis and 43 asymptomatic healthy women were subjected to cervical cytology and microbiological investigations for detection of Bacterial vaginosis, G. vaginalis, T. vaginalis, C. albicans and M. hominis. Cervical inflammatory changes were reported in 81.4% of cases and 60.4% of controls (p < 0.05) and were significantly associated with Bacterial Vaginosis and G. vaginalis infection (p < 0.01). Cervical inflammation was detected in all cases of Trichomonasis.
TI  - [Colposcopy images of cervix in women with Gardnerella vaginalis infection].
AB  - Among micro-organisms infecting vagina whose dominant genus is GV anaerobic bacteria are often present. There are reports that GV infections of vagina and uterine cervix, apart from their well-known negative role in obstetrics practice can play a role in carcinogenic processes of uterine cervix. The aim of the study was to assess characteristic colposcopy images of cervix in women with Gardnerella vaginalis infection. The research was carried out on 1180 women hospitalised in the period of 14 months. Many observations lead to conclusions that pathognomic clinic feature of Gardnerella vaginalis infection of uterine cervix is visible in colposcope presence of clean, translucent mucus in external cervical os and opaque vaginal contents in the rear vaginal vault. High hydrogen ion concentration in vaginal contents (pH 6.0 and over) correlates with positive "fishy odour test" of this contents. Gardnerella vaginalis infection of vagina and uterine cervix concerns women with existing erosion-type changes of uterine cervix. Visible in colposcopic test restless and "spotted" images visible after Schiller test are pathognomic colposcopic features of Gardnerella vaginalis infection.
TI  - [Estimation of cytological smears in women with Gardnerella vaginalis infections  of vagina and uterine cervix].
AB  - Among micro-organisms infecting vagina whose dominant genus is Gardnerella vaginalis anaerobic bacteria are often present. Well-known damaging tissues and cells features of anaerobic bacteria are taken under consideration as factors which are conductive to generating pathological changes in cervical epithelium. The aim of this study was evaluation of cytological smears (Pap smear, Gram stain and H + E stain) in women with Gardnerella vaginalis infections of vagina and uterine cervix. The research was carried out on 1180 women hospitalised in the prior of fourteen months in Obstetrics-Gynaecological Department of the Municipal Hospital in Kielce. It was proved that characteristic microscopic feature of vagina and uterine cervix Gardnerella vaginalis infection is the absence of lactic acid bacillus, Lactobacillus vaginalis in vaginal contents and a presence of a small number of polynuclear neutrophil leucocytes. Marker cells (clue cells) are easily recognised in microscopic image in vaginal smears stained by Gram's method as well as Papanicolaou method. High sensitivity and specificity of these markers suggest usefulness of cytological smears in diagnosing Gardnerella vaginalis infections.
TI  - [The role of lower genital tract infection in PROM].
AB  - The authors conducted a prospective study of the role of lower genital tract infection in PTL and PROM in high risk obstetric population with special interest in pathogens colonizing the maternal tract. A total amount of 62 women within 28 to 37 weeks of gestation were enrolled and interviewed. Subjects were cultured for Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacterioides fragilis, M. Hominis, U. Urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida galabrata and they were followed to delivery. Preterm rupture of membranes occurred in 30.6% of these pregnancies.

TI  - [Value of a computer-assisted screening method (PAPNET) for the detection of infectious cervico-uterine smears].
AB  - There have been several reports regarding the accuracy of the PAPNET system applied to the screening for cancerous and precancerous lesions. Based on neuronal networks, this computerized tool was initially trained to select atypical cells. It has been approved in the USA for the re-screening of cervical smears for quality assurance. However, its particular behaviour has not been frequently studied when the system is designed to detect frequent infectious organisms. We report the results of re-screening of 42 inflammatory cervico-uterine smears by the PAPNET system. The computerized images were reviewed by two different pathologists, with complete agreement between the two observers in 39 cases. Infectious organisms were detected in only 66% of cases. Trichomonas, mycoses and Gardnerella were diagnosed in 63%, 56% and 87% of cases respectively. No herpetic lesions were identified. The low accuracy of the PAPNET system in the diagnosis of infectious cervico-uterine smears should be taken into account if this system is developed as an exclusive pre-screening method.
TI  - Reiter's syndrome induced by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  
TI  - Acquisition of iron by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Six Gardnerella vaginalis strains were examined for the ability to utilize various iron-containing compounds as iron sources. In a plate bioassay, all six strains acquired iron from ferrous chloride, ferric chloride, ferrous sulfate, ferric ammonium citrate, ferrous ammonium sulfate, bovine and equine hemin, bovine catalase, and equine, bovine, rabbit, and human hemoglobin. All six strains also acquired iron from human lactoferrin, but not from human transferrin, as determined by a liquid broth growth assay. Siderophore production was detected in eight G. vaginalis strains by the chrome azurol S universal chemical assay. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cytoplasmic membrane proteins isolated from G. vaginalis 594 grown under iron-replete and iron-restricted conditions revealed several iron-regulated proteins ranging in molecular mass from 33 to 94 kDa. These results indicate that G. vaginalis may acquire iron from iron salts and host iron compounds.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: association with adverse pregnancy outcome.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the most common lower genital tract infection encountered  among women of reproductive age. This condition can best be considered as a vaginal syndrome associated with an alteration of the normal vaginal flora rather than an infection specific to any one microorganism. Bacterial vaginosis is a clinical condition with a complex microbiology that is characterized by a reduced concentration of a normally abundant Lactobacillus species along with high concentrations of gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, particularly, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus, Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Mycoplasma species. The exact make up of the microorganisms and their relative concentration vary among women who have this condition. Although it was previously regarded as a harmless condition, recent work has linked bacterial vaginosis to numerous upper genital tract complications such as preterm labor and preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, and postpartum endometritis. The findings from recent prospective randomized trials suggest that treatment of bacterial vaginosis in certain women who are at high risk for preterm delivery decreases the rate of preterm birth.
TI  - Characterization of Actinomyces turicensis and Actinomyces radingae strains from  human clinical samples.
AB  - Whole-organism protein electrophoresis was used to compare and group unidentified coryneform bacteria resembling Gardnerella vaginalis and various Actinomyces and Arcanobacterium species. The obtained clusters of strains were further characterized by whole-cell fatty acid analysis and a variety of biochemical tests. Species-specific oligonucleotide probes based on 16S rRNA gene sequences were designed. The results demonstrate that the majority of the isolates belonged to Actinomyces turicensis; the other strains belonged to Actinomyces radingae. The descriptions of both species are emended.
TI  - Preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  - Opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (PTB) cases. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which Gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic species primarily among Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Mobiluncus; Mycoplasma hominis; and Ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. This BV complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, PTB, and other perinatal infectious complications. Pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. In the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. Also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely F. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and F. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. Although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to PTB.
TI  - Female genital tract bacterial coisolates with Candida albicans in patients without clinical vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In vitro, Candida albicans has demonstrated the ability to inhibit replication of selected bacteria. Little information exists on the impact of C. albicans on the vaginal bacterial flora in vivo. The purpose of this study is to identify the coexisting bacterial flora when C. albicans is isolated from vaginal cultures submitted to a hospital-based testing facility for reasons other than vulvovaginitis. METHODOLOGY: All specimens (240) received from ambulatory care clinics over a six-month period were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and Candida species. Those specimens submitted for cervicitis, vaginitis, or vaginal discharge and those from which yeasts other than C. albicans were isolated were eliminated. To control for sample biases, a subgroup composed of all pregnant women for whom cultures were done as screening procedures was similarly studied. Chi-square analyses, comparing the prevalence of individual bacteria isolated with and without the presence of C. albicans, were done for all study populations using SPSS for Windows software (1994). RESULTS: Two hundred and forty consecutive specimens were bacteriologically analyzed. Of the 220 vaginal samples used in the study, C. albicans was isolated in 44 instances (20%). Neither the presence of the lactobacilli nor the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis markedly influenced the isolation rate of C. albicans. The group B streptococci had a greater probability of coisolation when C. albicans was present (27.3% verses 16%), but this was not statistically significant (P < 0.8). Dissociation between the presence of C. albicans and the coisolation of Peptostreptococcus species and anaerobic gram-positive cocci and/or bacilli was noted (P < 0.0819), while the incidence of gram-positive aerobic bacilli was reduced in the presence of C. albicans (30/176 [17.1%] versus 6/44 [13.6%]), this reduced incidence was not statistically significant. Isolation data of the subgroup of pregnant women supported these observations. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of the study, statistically, the data suggests that an inverse relationship exists between the presence of C. albicans and recovery of Peptostreptococcus and anaerobic gram-positive cocci and bacilli.
TI  - Cytologic findings in a neovagina created with Vecchietti's technique for treating vaginal aplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report long-term cytologic findings after treatment of congenital vaginal aplasia or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH) using progressive traction of the vulvar tissues, or Vecchietti's technique (VT). STUDY DESIGN: In eight women with MRKH, neovaginal smears stained by the Harris-Schorr technique were collected 2-12 years after VT. RESULTS: Eosinophilic superficial cells observed in all cases indicate that the neovaginal epithelium responds to hormonal variations. The presence of Doderlein bacilli (seven cases) suggests that the regional environment of the neovagina is almost the same as that of the normal vagina. Gardnerella vaginalis (one case) and human papilloma virus infection (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) (one case) were also observed. CONCLUSION: Neovaginal smears taken after the cicatrization period following construction of a neovagina by VT show a remarkable resemblance to those from normal vaginal mucosa and suggest that these neovaginas are almost the same as normal vaginas.
TI  - Chlamydia trachomatis: probable cause of prostatitis.
AB  - Seventy-eight men with symptoms of chronic or subacute prostatitis were enrolled. Investigations for the presence of Chlamydia trachomatis in urethral swabs were carried out. The expressed prostatic secretions were additionally examined for Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, Trichomonas vaginalis, yeast-like fungi and leucocyte count. Furthermore, all patients were evaluated for the presence of serum anti-chlamydial IgG antibodies. Signs of inflammation on the basis of the count of leucocytes per hpf in the prostatic secretions were detected in 42 patients (group I). Prostatodynia was found in the remaining 36 men (group II). In group I, chlamydial antigen was detected in the urethra and expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) in 6 (14.3%) and 9 (21.4%) patients, respectively. No evidence of current chlamydial infection was found in group II. The presence of serum anti-chlamydial IgG antibodies was demonstrated in 13/42 (30.9%) patients with prostatitis and in 3/36 (8.3%) patients with prostatodynia (P < 0.01). The results suggest that chlamydia may be one of the causative agents of chronic prostatitis.
TI  - Use of a continuous-culture biofilm system to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus acidophilus have been shown to grow to high titers in a simple biofilm system. This system was used in the present investigation to compare the biofilm-eradicating concentrations (BECs) of amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole to standard tube MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) results. With the lactobacillus, the BEC/tube MBC ratio was at least 16:1, while for G. vaginalis the ratio varied from 2:1 to 512:1. The simple continuous-culture system used in the present investigation is ideal for investigating the BEC for bacteria involved in complex ecological situations such as bacterial vaginosis and may be useful for the identification of the most effective and selective antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Clinical findings in female genital schistosomiasis in Madagascar.
AB  - To assess the morbidity of S. haematobium infection in women of reproductive age  (15-49 years) in the western part of Madagascar, the village of Betalatala with a prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in women of 75.6% (95% confidence limit 69.3 to 81.9%) was compared with a neighbouring village with similar socio-economic characteristics and a prevalence of 5.0% (95% confidence limit 0 to 11.75%). The women were questioned in Malagasy about obstetrical history and urogynecological symptoms. They were examined gynaecologically, parasitologically and by ultrasonography. Important STDs were excluded by appropriate diagnostics. In Betalatala significantly more women reported a history of spontaneous abortion (P < 0.01), complaints of irregular menstruation (P < 0.001), pelvic pain (<0.05), vaginal discharge (P < 0.0001), dysuria (P < 0.05) and haematuria (P < 0.01) than in the control village. Biopsies were obtained from the cervix of 36 women with macroscopical lesions, and in 12 cases S. haematobium eggs were found by histological sectioning (33.3%). In the control village no eggs were detected in the histological sections of biopsies taken from 14 women. (P < 0.05). Infections with Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis and Treponema pallidum were found in similar frequencies in both villages. In 9.8% of the women in Betalatala abnormalities of the upper reproductive tract were revealed by ultrasonography versus none in the women from the control village (P < 0.05). Echographic abnormalities of the urinary tract were present in 24% and 3% of the women in the study village and in the control village, respectively (P < 0.0001). These findings were accompanied by an elevated frequency of haematuria (55% versus 20%) and proteinuria (70.4% versus 25%) in the study population (P < 0.0001). Our study indicates that S. haematobium infection in women may not only cause symptoms in the urinary tract, but also frequently in the lower and upper reproductive tract.
TI  - The role of Gardnerella vaginalis in nonspecific vaginitis in intra uterine contraceptive device users.
AB  - Two Hundred Forty patients who had Intra Uterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD) and  manifested of nonspecific vaginitis were investigated for the presence of G. vaginalis. Pure growth of this organism was obtained in 14(5.8%) cases while 116(48.3%) cases showed this organism in association with other organisms e.g. Esch. coli (11.7%), Klebsiella (9.2%), Candida (9.2%), Strept. faecalis (7.3%), Proteus species (5.8%) and Staph. albus (5%).

TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in an obstetric population of Barcelona].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a pregnant population of Barcelona (Spain). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 301 pregnant women controlled in the Hospital Clinic i Provincial (HCP) of Barcelona were enrolled in the study. Complete epidemiological information, and vaginal samples were available in 293 women. BV was diagnosed by Gram stain of vaginal smear (Nugent's criteria). RESULTS: BV was detected in 22 pregnant women (7.5%; 95% CI: 4.6-10.5%). There was no association between race, parity, education, marital status, smoking and drug use, and the presence of BV. Non-use of birth control method (72.3% vs 34.4%; p < 0.0001), presence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) during pregnancy (22.7% vs 3.7%; p < 0.0001), HIV seropositivity (13.6% vs 2.9%; p = 0.041) and presence of symptoms of vaginitis (40.9% vs 13.3%; p = 0.009) were significantly associated with the presence of BV. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of BV in a pregnant population of Barcelona (Spain) is 7.5%. Further work is needed to evaluate the usefulness of BV as a prescreening marker for STD and HIV infection. The Gram stain provides an inexpensive, fast and easy method to diagnose BV, and may allow us to screen, treat and prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with it.
TI  - Few microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis may constitute the pathologic core: a population-based microbiologic study among 3596 pregnant women.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between various microorganisms isolated from the genital tract in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional population-based study among pregnant women addressed at their first antenatal visit before 24 full gestational weeks from the referring area of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, from November 1992 to February 1994. The main outcome measures were prevalence of various microorganisms and statistical estimates of interactions (crude, adjusted, and relative odds ratios) between the microorganisms isolated from the lower genital tract in pregnant women with and without clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. RESULTS: Three thousand five hundred ninety-six (3596) pregnant women were asked to participate. Of the 3596 pregnant women 3174 (88.4%) agreed to participate before 24 full gestational weeks. After controlling for the presence of other microorganisms, strong associations between Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, Mycoplasma hominis, and present bacterial vaginosis were found. Similarly Lactobacillus spp. were found to be associated with the absence of bacterial vaginosis. The combination of G. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria and/or M. hominis was found in 59.6% of the cases with bacterial vaginosis and in 3.9% of the cases without bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio 36.4, 95% confidence interval 27.8 to 47.8). The crude odds ratio was found to be as high as 74.8 (95% confidence interval 32.3 to 174.1) when the combination of G. vaginalis, M. hominis, anaerobic bacteria, and no Lactobacillus spp. was associated with bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSION: There is a microbial foundation for bacterial vaginosis, and it is possibly due to an intermicrobial interaction in which the microorganisms G. vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and M. hominis are dominating, indicating that these constitute the pathologic core of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Immunoglobulin A response against Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin and sialidase activity in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the immunoglobulin A immune response to Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin and sialidase activity in vaginal fluids from patients with bacterial vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: Nonpregnant women who were examined at a gynecologic clinic, in an age range of 18 to 62 years, were enrolled. The study population comprised 131 healthy volunteers, 32 women with bacterial vaginosis that was positive for immunoglobulin A to Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin, 40 women with bacterial vaginosis that was negative for immunoglobulin A to Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin, and 19 women with Candida vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed by clinical criteria and Gram stain. RESULTS: Sialidase activity was present in 75% (54/72) of patients with bacterial vaginosis. Women having bacterial vaginosis and lacking a specific immunoglobulin A response had a significantly higher level of sialidase activity than patients who had an immune response against Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin. Sialidase activity was detected in 87% (35/40) of the former subgroup of patients with bacterial vaginosis and in 59% (19/32) of women of the latter subgroup. No sialidase activity was measured in patients with candidiasis. Specificity of the assay for healthy controls was 95% (124/131 women without sialidase activity). CONCLUSIONS: Sialidases produced by Prevotella bivia and other microorganisms present in the microflora of patients with bacterial vaginosis are very likely a virulence factor not only by destroying the mucins and enhancing adherence of bacteria but also by impairing a specific immunoglobulin A immune response against other virulence factors such as cytotoxin from Gardnerella vaginalis.
TI  - [In vitro inhibition of the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis by bacteriocins produced by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa with inhibitory capacity in vitro was studied  on Gardnerella vaginalis strains. METHODS: Antimicrobial activity was demonstrated by inhibitory halos of bacterial growth on solid media by two methods: crossed streak and agar well diffusion. The inhibitory activity of this substance produced by P. aeruginosa was characterized as bacteriocin by: activity spectrum sensitivity proteolytic enzyme, chloroform, heat, pH, ultraviolet, irradiation effect and molecular weight. RESULTS: Four strains of P. aeruginosa producers of bacteriocins were chosen for this study and contacted with 40 strains of G. vaginalis. The producing strain D inhibited 70% of these G. vaginalis strains. The strains B and C inhibited 55% and 52.5%, respectively. The 3 strains presented a wide rank of action but the strain A had effect on a few strains of G. vaginalis. CONCLUSIONS: This work showed the inhibitory in vitro effect of bacteriocins of P. aeruginosa on strains of G. vaginalis. The results obtained suggest the probable topic application of bacteriocins as an alternative of conventional therapeutic on this infection biological control.

TI  - Impact of metronidazole therapy on preterm birth in women with bacterial vaginosis flora (Gardnerella vaginalis): a randomised, placebo controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether metronidazole treatment of women with a heavy growth of Gardnerella vaginalis during mid-pregnancy would reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm birth. DESIGN: A multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Four metropolitan hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred and seventy-nine singleton women with a heavy growth of G. vaginalis or Gram stain indicative of bacterial vaginosis at 19 weeks of gestation. INTERVENTIONS: Oral metronidazole (400 mg) or placebo twice daily for two days at 24 weeks of gestation, and at 29 weeks if G. vaginalis found in test-of-cure swab four weeks after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Spontaneous preterm birth less than 37 weeks. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference between metronidazole and placebo groups in overall preterm birth (31/429 [7.2%] vs 32/428 [7.5%]) or spontaneous preterm birth (20/429 [4.7%] vs 24/428 [5.6%]). Among the 480 women with bacterial vaginosis treatment had no effect on spontaneous preterm birth (11/242 [4.5%] vs 15/238 [6.3%]). In the subset of 46 women with a previous preterm birth, women in the metronidazole group showed a significant reduction in spontaneous preterm birth (2/22 [9.1%] vs 10/24 [41.7%], OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01-0.84). A treatment effect was also found in compliant women with a previous preterm birth and bacterial vaginosis (0/14 [0%] vs 6/17 [35.3%], OR 0.0, 95% CI 0.0-0.94). CONCLUSION: Metronidazole treatment of women with a heavy growth of G. vaginalis or bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the preterm birth rate. Among women with a previous preterm birth, treatment reduced the risk of spontaneous preterm birth. Further studies are required to confirm these findings.
TI  - Molecular evolution of the tet(M) gene in Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Five clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis known to carry the tetracycline resistance determinant Tet M were examined by hybridization and nucleotide sequencing. Four of the strains carried tet(M) genes with identical sequences. The two versions of the tet(M) gene found in G. vaginalis did not show complete identity with other published tet(M) sequences, but showed mosaic structures with regions of homology to tet(M) gene sequences from Tn916, Tn1545 and the American type plasmid found in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Hybridization studies showed that all isolates carried the tet(M) gene on a single HindII restriction fragment of variable length. No evidence was found for the presence of sequences homologous to the transposition functions of Tn916.
TI  - [Vulvovaginitis].
AB  - Candidiasis, infection due to Trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis (Gardnerella vaginalis and/or other species) represent the major three causes of vulvo-vaginitis. Other are rare bacterial infections and non infectious vaginitis such as allergic and post-menopausal vaginitis with epithelial atrophy. Clues for the diagnosis include the clinical features of vaginal discharge, cytological examinations, bacterial and fungal cultures. Only T. vaginalis seems to be responsible of sexually transmitted disease. All appropriate antibacterial or anticandidosic treatment are immediately effective, but the mechanisms of recurrent candidiasis and vaginosis are still unclear.
TI  - Metronidazole. A therapeutic review and update.
AB  - The nitroimidazole antibiotic metronidazole has a limited spectrum of activity that encompasses various protozoans and most Gram-negative and Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. Metronidazole has activity against protozoans like Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis, for which the drug was first approved as an effective treatment. Anaerobic bacteria which are typically sensitive are primarily Gram-negative anaerobes belonging to the Bacteroides and Fusobacterium spp. Gram-positive anaerobes such as peptostreptococci and Clostridia spp. are likely to test sensitive to metronidazole, but resistant isolates are probably encountered with greater frequency than with the Gram-negative anaerobes. Gardnerella vaginalis is a pleomorphic Gram-variable bacterial bacillus that is also susceptible to metronidazole. Helicobacter pylori has been strongly associated with gastritis and duodenal ulcers. Classic regimens for eradicating this pathogen have included metronidazole, usually with acid suppression medication plus bismuth and amoxicillin. The activity of metronidazole against anaerobic bowel flora has been used for prophylaxis and treatment of patients with Crohn's disease who might develop an infectious complication. Treatment of Clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembraneous colitis has usually been with oral metronidazole or vancomycin, but the lower cost and similar efficacy of metronidazole, coupled with the increased concern about imprudent use of vancomycin leading to increased resistance in enterococci, have made metronidazole the preferred agent here. Metronidazole has played an important role in anaerobic-related infections. Advantages to using metronidazole are the percentage of sensitive Gram-negative anaerobes, its availability as oral and intravenous dosage forms, its rapid bacterial killing, its good tissue penetration, its considerably lower chance of inducing C. difficile colitis, and expense. Metronidazole has notable effectiveness in treating anaerobic brain abscesses. Metronidazole is a cost-effective agent due to its low acquisition cost, its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, an acceptable adverse effect profile, and its undiminished antimicrobial activity. While its role as part of a therapeutic regimen for treating mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections has been reduced by newer, more expensive combination therapies, these new combinations have not been shown to have any therapeutic advantage over metronidazole. Although the use of metronidazole on a global scale has been curtailed by newer agents for various infections, metronidazole still has a role for these and other therapeutic uses. Many clinicians still consider metronidazole to be the 'gold standard' antibiotic against which all other antibiotics with anaerobic activity should be compared.
TI  - Vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women who have not received estrogen replacement therapy.
AB  - We studied the vaginal microflora of 73 postmenopausal women who had never received estrogen replacement therapy. The median age of these women was 67 years, and none of them had bacterial vaginosis. Lactobacilli were detected in 36 (49%) of these women at a mean concentration of 10(5.7) cfu/g of vaginal fluid. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 38% of the women. Some of the other organisms that were recovered, including Gardnerella vaginalis (27% of the women), Ureaplasma urealyticum (13%), Candida albicans (1%), and Prevotella bivia (33%), were less frequently isolated from postmenopausal women than from women of reproductive age, while coliforms (41%) were recovered at higher frequencies. Lactobacilli, yeasts, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria are less commonly part of the vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women than in women of reproductive age, which may explain the decrease in the incidence of bacterial vaginosis and yeast vaginitis among these women.
TI  - Ultrastructural characteristics of Gardnerella vaginalis infection in the heterosexual couple.
AB  - Adhesion and penetration of Gardnerella vaginalis into the male urethral and female vaginal epithelial cells were evaluated in a prospective cohort study of infected females and their sexual partners. Vaginal secretions of 10 women with culture proven G. vaginalis infection and semen samples of their asymptomatic husbands were analyzed with conventional optical and electron microscopy. G. vaginalis was isolated in 50% of the male sexual partners of women harboring the microorganism. G. vaginalis adheres to the plasmatic membrane and penetrates into the cytoplasm of both vaginal and urethral epithelial cells. The ability of G. vaginalis to colonize the male lower genital tract may have clinical relevance with respect to the role of the male partner in the reinfection of women.
TI  - Multiple C-terminal serine phosphorylation accompanies both protein kinase C-dependent and -independent activation of cytosolic 85 kDa phospholipase A2 in macrophages.
AB  - Exposure of mouse macrophages to either phorbol ester or certain bacteria was previously shown to cause increased phosphorylation of the cytosolic 85 kDa phospholipase A2 as well as a stable increase in its catalytic activity. We have now attempted to map the major phosphorylation sites on the enzyme in such cells. Phosphorylation occurred on serine residues without a detectable increase in either phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine. After CNBr cleavage five fragments showed increased 32P labelling. Among those the most heavily labelled fragment was identified as the most C-terminal (residues 698-749), containing six serine residues. This was true whether phorbol ester or bacteria, causing protein kinase C-independent phospholipase A2 activation, was used as stimulus. The heavy phosphorylation of the most C-terminal fragment and an analysis of tryptic peptides derived from it suggested that more than one of the six serine residues became phosphorylated. Smaller increases also occurred in other CNBr-cleaved fragments from the C-terminal part of the protein, including that carrying Ser-505, a known target of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK-2 (extracellular-signal regulated kinase). Dexamethasone treatment (1-100 nM for 20 h), which was earlier shown to dose-dependently down-regulate the 85 kDa phospholipase A2 and its activation by phorbol ester and zymosan, was here shown also to counteract the protein kinase C-independent activation and arachidonate release elicited by bacteria. It remains to be determined whether all phosphorylation sites are equally affected under those conditions.
TI  - Microbiology of semen specimens from males attending a fertility clinic.
AB  - The relationship between semen quality, pyospermia and bacteriology was studied in 201 semen specimens from male patients attending a fertility clinic. Semen quality parameters were within normal limits in 115 (57%) patients, slightly reduced in 60 (30%), and 26 (13%) had findings indicating reduced fertility. Twelve patients (6%) had pyospermia. In 182 patients, 552 microorganisms were detected, including Enterobacteriaceae (2.8%), Gardnerella vaginalis (9.6%), Chlamydia trachomatis (1.6%), Mycoplasma genitalium (0.9%), and Ureaplasma urealyticum (11.8%). Semen quality was neither related to occurrence of microorganisms nor pyospermia. However, pyospermia was associated with simultaneous growth of Gardnerella vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. The exact nature of this association could not be ascertained, in as far as the males were not questioned about urethritis symptoms.
TI  - [Study on the inactivated vaccine of Gardnerella vaginalis of fox. VI. Experimental development of the inactivated vaccine of Gardnerella vaginalis of fox].
AB  - The aluminum hydroxide gel, propolis and oil adjuvant inactivated vaccines were developed by silecting good immunity, representing principal epidemic serotype I GVF44 of Gardnerella vaginalis of fox in civil. The results showed that the aluminum hydroxide gel vaccine in safety was better than propolis and oil adjuvant vaccines, the most optimal inactivated concentration of formalin is 0.1%. Efficient immunity doses are 4 billon bacteria/1 ml. There were on any bad influences to occur for fox after the aluminum hydroxide gel of three times immunity doses were injected. The inoculated foxes could resist challenge of a hundred ID50 virulent strains after the vaccine was injected to foxes for 21 d. Immunity period of the vaccine is 6 months storage period is 10 months at 4-10 degrees C. The field experiments confirmed that the vaccine possessed accuracy, stability and reliability.
TI  - Vaginal pH as a marker for bacterial pathogens and menopausal status.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to confirm the elevation of vaginal pH expected in patients with bacterial pathogens in premenopausal women and to examine the relationship of serum follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels to vaginal pH in menopausal patients without and with hormone replacement therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Vaginal pH was determined by phenaphthazine (Nitrazine) pH paper in 253 patients seen in a solo private practice for routine speculum examination. None of the patients were pregnant. Measurements were made of serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol for 172 patients and vaginal cultures were taken from 82 patients. Vaginal pH was correlated with vaginal cultures and serum follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels by use of statistical analysis. RESULTS: Vaginal pH was elevated in all premenopausal patients with documented bacterial pathogens. Serum estradiol levels showed an inverse and serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels a direct statistical correlation with vaginal pH in menopausal patients. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of vaginal pH is useful, effective, and inexpensive for screening purposes. A vaginal pH of 4.5 is consistent with a premenopausal serum estradiol level and the absence of bacterial pathogens. An elevated vaginal pH in the 5.0 to 6.5 range suggests a diagnosis of either bacterial pathogens or decreased serum estradiol. In patients with an elevated pH, vaginal culture should establish the diagnosis. In the absence of bacterial pathogens, a vaginal pH of 6.0 to 7.5 is strongly suggestive of menopause. Titration of estradiol level by vaginal pH during estrogen replacement therapy may help menopausal women avoid side effects or cessation of therapy.

TI  - Genotypic differentiation of Gardnerella vaginalis by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA).
AB  - In total 34 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were analyzed with various molecular techniques in order to find the possibility of dividing this single species into different genotypes. Classical ribotyping, PCR-ribotyping and restriction analysis of 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer sequences were all unsuccessful in genotype differentiation of these bacteria. Only amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) was suitable in recognizing different G. vaginalis genotypes. At least 3-4 genotypes were identified with different restriction enzymes, some of which showed a prevalent distribution in certain of the centers from which they were collected. Although in this study no correlation was found between bacterial vaginosis and any of the genotypes identified, the ARDRA method could prove to be a useful tool for studying the etiopathology and epidemiology of G. vaginalis.
TI  - [A comparison of 2 clinical laboratory methods in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity, the specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of two laboratory methods used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis; Gram stain and the Gardnerella vaginalis culture, in comparison with the clinical sings of vaginal discharge; homogeneous secretion, pH > 4.7, positive amine test and the presence of clue cells. DESIGN: A prospective, comparative and crossover type. SETTING: This study was carried out in the Health Center "Dr. Jose Castro Villagrana" SSA, situated in Tlalpan, Mexico City. From January, 1992 to July, 1996. PARTICIPANTS: 3,142 women, from 16 to 55 years old with cervicovaginitis diagnosis, without previous treatment and sexual active life history. RESULTS: By means of clinical criterion (33.1%), it was diagnosed 1,041 women with bacterial vaginosis. Statistical differences were not found between the culture and Gram stain in the presence or no-presence of bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by clinical criterion (p = 0.33) The clue cells were the best predictor of bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSIONS: The differences between both methods analysed were minimal and they didn't have statistical value so that, it is proposed the Gram stain as diagnostic method of bacterial vaginosis based on factors like speed, reproductiveness and low cost.
TI  - Identification and quantification of Bifidobacterium species isolated from food with genus-specific 16S rRNA-targeted probes by colony hybridization and PCR.
AB  - A Bifidobacterium genus-specific target sequence in the V9 variable region of the 16S rRNA has been elaborated and was used to develop a hybridization probe. The specificity of this probe, named lm3 (5'-CGGGTGCTI*CCCACTTTCATG-3'), was used to identify all known type strains and distinguish them from other bacteria. All of the 30 type strains of Bifidobacterium which are available at the German culture collection Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, 6 commercially available production strains, and 34 closely related relevant strains (as negative controls) were tested. All tested bifidobacteria showed distinct positive signals by colony hybridization, whereas all negative controls showed no distinct dots except Gardnerella vaginalis DSM4944 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii DSM4902, which gave slight signals. Furthermore, we established a method for isolation and identification of bifidobacteria from food by using a PCR assay without prior isolation of DNA but breaking the cells with proteinase K. By this method, all Bifidobacterium strains lead to a DNA product of the expected size. We also established a quick assay to quantitatively measure Bifidobacterium counts in food and feces by dilution plating and colony hybridization. We were able to demonstrate that 2.1 x 10(6) to 2.3 x 10(7) colonies/g of sour milk containing bifidobacteria hybridized with the specific nucleotide probe. With these two methods, genus-specific colony hybridization and genus-specific PCR, it is now possible to readily and accurately detect any bifidobacteria in food and fecal samples and to discriminate between them and members of other genera.
TI  - Semisynthetic derivatives of purpuromycin as potential topical agents for vaginal infections.
AB  - Purpuromycin (1) is an antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, encompassing bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, particularly those involved in vaginal infections. With the aim of enhancing the solubility and reducing the serum binding, a chemical program of modifications was undertaken on the natural compound, and a new interesting series of derivatives at the naphthoquinone system was synthesized and evaluated as potential topical agents for vaginal infections. In particular three semisynthetic derivatives, 7'-amino (8a), 7'-methylamino (8b), 7'-ethylamino (8c), of 7'-demethoxypurpuromycin seemed to be the most promising. They were tested for in vitro activity against three of the most important vaginal pathogens and showed activity similar to that of purpuromycin against Candida isolates while they were significantly more active against Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis, which are cultured in media containing blood or serum. This is probably due to the fact that the activity of the derivatives is less antagonized by these supplements than that of purpuromycin.
TI  - [Diagnosis of chlamydia and gardnerella infection in patients with acute gynecological diseases].
AB  - Chlamydial infection was diagnosed by indirect immunofluorescence in 26.3% and Gardnerella infection in 28.7% of patients with acute gynecological diseases. The degree of vaginal contamination in patients with chlamydiasis was virtually the same as in all other examinees, whereas in patients with gardnerellosis the third and fourth degrees of purity predominated. Hence, assessment of the vaginal contamination (purity) is an additional criterion for screening for gardnerellosis but providing no clinically significant information for the detection of chlamydiasis.
TI  - [Laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Microbiological analysis of discharge from the genitals in passenger car conductors (5787 women and 1496 men aged 20 to 40) showed Gardnerella vaginalis to be the most frequent agent of urogenital infection. It was isolated in 26% cases, whereas Trichomonas were isolated in 2.5%, fungi in 1.5%, and gonococci in 0.27% cases. The diagnosis of gardnerellosis is reliable if the key cells are found. Monoinfection with G. vaginalis was diagnosed in 80% patients, the overwhelming majority (74%) of carriers of this bacterium had no inflammatory symptoms, and in only 26% the carrier state was associated with the presence of leukocytes and histiocytes, more often in the cervix. In men the carrier state was detected in 0.4% cases. The clinical picture of Gardnerella infection is similar to that of infection with Mobiluncus, which is little known. This infection occurred 10 times less frequently (2.5%) than gardnerellosis, but in 92% cases it was a component of mixed infection, most frequently in association with G. vaginalis. A little known fungus Leptothrix was found in the genital discharge of 4% examinees, mostly women, but sometimes in men as well; it is represented by 3 types of ramifying threads. The practitioners are to know these infections causing specific diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, which are often responsible for serious complications in gynecology and obstetrics.
TI  - Evidence for a commensal, symbiotic relationship between Gardnerella vaginalis and Prevotella bivia involving ammonia: potential significance for bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Six strains of Prevotella bivia and 4 of Gardnerella vaginalis were examined for  nutrient substrate utilization as part of ongoing studies on the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. Addition of single amino acids to vaginal defined medium (VDM) was stimulatory to the growth of P. bivia but not to G. vaginalis. However, peptides significantly promoted the growth of both organisms. Growth of P. bivia in VDM and VDM supplemented with either amino acids or peptone was accompanied by net ammonia production, while growth of G. vaginalis under the same conditions resulted in net ammonia utilization. Ammonia-enriched supernatants from the growth of P. bivia in peptone-supplemented VDM were stimulatory to G. vaginalis growth. However, ammonia-reduced supernatants from G. vaginalis growth in peptone-supplemented VDM had a neutral effect on P. bivia growth. A commensal relationship between P. bivia to G. vaginalis is proposed, with ammonia flow as a mechanism to support this hypothesis.
TI  - What is normal vaginal flora?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the composition of the vaginal flora of healthy women over  time, and in relation to hormonal changes, sexual activity, and hygiene habits. DESIGN: A longitudinal surveillance of the vaginal flora over an eight week period. SUBJECTS: 26 female health care workers in local genitourinary medicine clinics. METHODS: The participants were anonymised. They filled in diary cards daily. Blind vaginal swabs were self-taken two-seven times weekly. A smear was air-dried for later Gram staining. The swabs were also cultured for Candida spp, Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. RESULTS: Of 26 subjects, only four had normal vaginal microbiology throughout. One woman, who was not sexually active, had bacterial vaginosis (BV) throughout and nine (35%) had intermittent BV. Candidiasis was found intermittently in eight women (31%), and eight had normal microscopy. U urealyticum was isolated intermittently in 40% of women with BV, 25% with candida, and 50% with normal microscopy. Many women were symptomatic, but symptoms correlated poorly with microbiological findings. All but two women were sexually active; however, more women with BV were exposed to semen. BV seemed to be related to frequent use of scented soap, and there appeared to be an additive effect of clothing and hygiene factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study raises doubts about what should be regarded as normal vaginal flora. It calls into question the significance of finding BV or U urealyticum on a single occasion in asymptomatic women, or of finding normal flora in symptomatic women. The effect of external factors on the vaginal flora deserve further study.

TI  - Interrelationships within the bacterial flora of the female genital tract.
AB  - Analysis of 240 consecutive vaginal swabs using the compatibility profile technique revealed that only 2 bacteria have the ability to be a sole isolate and as such a candidate to be a major aerobic regulator of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract (BFFGT). Compatibility profiles of Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis have shown that these organisms shared compatibility profiling for the majority of the normal bacterial constituents of the female genital tract. Dominance disruption appears to come from the addition of compatible co-isolates and presumed loss of numerical superiority. These phenomena appear to be the keys to reregulation of BFFGT. Lactobacillus appears to be the major regulator of both G. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria. When additional organisms are added to the bacterial flora, they may add to or partially negate the inhibitory influence of Lactobacillus on the BFFGT. Inhibitor interrelationships appear to exist between coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus and the group B streptococci (GBS) and other beta hemolytic streptococci. Facilitating interrelationships appear to exist between S. aureus and the GBS and selected Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Labial and vaginal microbiology: effects of extended panty liner use.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were 1) to better define the labial microflora and 2) to evaluate whether extended non-menstrual use of panty liners would increase genital carriage of undesirable bacteria and predispose to infection. METHODS: Healthy female volunteers (224) were prospectively randomized into panty liner wear groups A (Always((R)) deodorant) and B (Always((R)) non-deodorant) and into a control group C (no panty liner wear) with instructions for non-menstrual +/- menstrual use >/=5 h daily for 6 months. Selected aerobic bacteria were semiquantitatively cultured from the inner labial groove, the posterior fornix of the vagina, and the cervix pre-study and post-study. Used panty liners were quantitatively cultured, and vaginal secretions were examined by gas chromatography for fatty acid ratios as a measure of microbial flora shifts. RESULTS: At the pre-study, labial microflora in this study population contained significantly higher frequencies of Staphylococcus, coliforms, other gram-negative rods, and enterococci, and a decreased frequency of Gardnerella vaginalis relative to the vaginal microflora. After 6 months use of panty liners the frequencies (and densities) of the selected microorganisms in these two sites had not changed compared to controls, and fatty acid analyses of vaginal secretions gave no evidence of shifts in the microbial flora. CONCLUSIONS: Frequencies of selected genital microflora were different for the labia compared to the vagina. No increased carriage of medically important species was detected for either site after 6 months of daily (average 7.8 h) panty liner use.
TI  - Treatment of Gardnerella vaginalis infection.
AB  - This review of the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of Gardnerella vaginalis culture isolates shows that the drugs found sensitive to G. vaginalis cultures include the new antimicrobial agents- ciprofloxacin, cefuroxine and ceftazidine, and some older antibiotics- ceftriaxone, cloxacillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol and metranidazole. Streptomycin and augmentin showed intermediate sensitivity while penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline and gentamycin exhibited resistance to G. vaginalis isolates. Metronidazole is currently the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of G. vaginalis and its related infections because of its effectiveness not just against G. vaginalis but also against anaerobes. It can be administered orally, parenterally and intravaginally as gel or sponge. The advantages and drawbacks to the use of these G. vaginalis - sensitive drugs, and the place of alternative drugs in the management of G. vaginalis - associated infections are discussed.
TI  - The determination of phospholipase A2 enzyme activity in the vaginal secretions of pregnant and non-pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis-and in culture exudates of its causative organisms.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is presently being cited as a probable cause of premature labour, where it is thought that an abnormal excess of phospholipase A2 enzyme (PLA2 ), generated by infecting organisms, prematurely liberates prostaglandins, which trigger-off the labour process. PLA levels of pregnant and non-pregnant women, with and without BV infection were compared. The in vitro concentrations of PLA2 in broth cultures of infecting organisms were also measured. Mean PLA2 level in non-infected pregnant women was 777 units per mg but was raised to 1226 U/mg in those with BV ( P= <0.001). Mean level in non-infected normal women was 21 U/mg, but was raised to 97 U/mg in those having BV ( P= <0.001). PLA2 concentrations in broth cultures of the causative organisms showed that most Bacteroides strains produced the enzyme, having a mean concentration of 95 U/mg, but that it was generated by only 34% of Gardnerella vaginalis strains, their mean concentration being 32 U/mg.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and lower genital tract infections in women attending out-patient clinics at a tertiary institution serving a developing community.
AB  - The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and other lower genital tract infections were determined in women from a developing community. Patients were recruited from four out-patient clinics of a large urban tertiary referral hospital serving the indigent Black population of KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. A total of 208 women attending the sexually transmitted diseases (STD) (n = 51), colposcopy (n =50), family planning (n = 52) and antenatal (n = 55) clinics were investigated. Endocervical and vaginal specimens were collected for microbiological investigation of recognised sexually transmitted pathogens. Estimation of vaginal pH, amine test and wet smear microscopy were performed at the bedside. Peripheral venous blood was obtained for serological tests for syphilis, hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Vaginal infections were detected in a total of 50% (104) of women, endocervical infections alone in 9% (18) and concurrent vagino-endocervical infections in 20% (41). Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was diagnosed in 35% (73) and its prevalence amongst different clinic populations ranged from 25% to 41% with no significant differences between any groups. Trichomoniasis was detected significantly more often in women attending the STD and antenatal clinics. Endocervical infections were found mainly in women attending the STD clinic, though the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis amongst the other clinic attenders ranged from 13% to 20%. Micro-organisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, anaerobes and curved Gram-negative rods were found in significantly higher number of women with BV. This study confirms the high prevalence of vaginal, endocervical and mixed vagino-endocervical infections in women from developing communities. The high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis as a single infection and its association with other recognised sexually transmitted pathogens in a large proportion of women, is of significance since such infections not only predispose to ascending upper genital tract infections but are also associated with complications in pregnancy such as premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour and endometritis.

TI  - A prospective study of the correlation between genital pathogens and morbidity following diathermy loop excision of the transformation zone.
AB  - A prospective study of 48 women was carried out to estimate the incidence of common genital pathogens in women referred to colposcopy clinic requiring diathermy loop excision and to compare patient morbidity in the subgroups with and without genital pathogens. Of the 43 women included in the analysis, genital pathogens were present in 24 cases (56%) and absent in 19 (44%) of the 24 positive cases, 19 (79%) women had pathogen(s) on the cervical swab, 24 (100%) had pathogen(s) on the high vaginal swab and 15 (63%) had both a positive cervical and high vaginal swab (HVS). The most frequently isolated groups of organisms were mixed anaerobes, alone (four HVS and four cervical) or in combination with Gardnerella vaginalis (four HVS and three cervical) or coliforms (two HVS and two cervical). The mean duration of bleeding and vaginal discharge in the two study groups was not statistically significant (t value 1.97, P 0.05; and t value 0.48, P 0.5, respectively). However, the mean duration of bleeding graded by the patient as being moderate to severe was significantly different in the two groups (t value 3.18 P 0.01). Fifty-six per cent of the women in the study had confirmed genital pathogens, predominantly anaerobes, and the prolonged moderate-to-severe bleeding in this group suggests a potential role for prophylactic bacteriocides, although the study size was unable to implicate a single pathogen.
TI  - Diabetes and pregnancy: prophylaxis of genital infections.
AB  - Diabetic pregnant women have many potential reasons to have genital infections such as poor metabolic control and impairement of leucocyte function. Relative immune deficiency exists in pregnancy. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that pregnant patients with insulin-dependent diabetes have a higher rate of ante partum genital infections when compared with a pair-matched control population. Two groups of pregnant women consisting of 23 patients with and 23 without diabetes mellitus, underwent colposcopy and cytology between 16th and 24th week of gestation to detect the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV), Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans and aspecific infections. No significant differences were observed between the two groups.
TI  - [The microbial etiology of genital discharges in Nouakchott, Mauritania].
AB  - The survey carried on 579 patients of both sexes, consulting for genital discharges (spontaneous or referred), showed that in 61.1% men cases, STD agents were isolated (Neisseria gonorrhoeae 51.5%) and 64.4% in women cases (Gardnerella vaginalis 24%, Candida albicans 20%. Trichomonas vaginalis 14%). 17% of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains were penicillinase-producing (PPNG).
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological evaluation of bacterial vaginosis in women in a hospital from Rio Cuarto, Argentina].
AB  - One hundred and seventy nine women of discharge vaginal were studied. Endocervical and exocervical samples were obtained. The vaginal fluids samples were processed by the following tests: pH, fishy odor, clue cells observation was done by Gram reaction. Gardnerella vaginalis was identified through biochemical tests. G. vaginalis (23.4%), C. albicans (21.8%), T. vaginalis (14.5%), N. gonorrhoeae (5.5%) and C. trachomatis (11.7%), were found in 42 women. A 7.1% of forms compatible with Mobiluncus spp. were observed by direct Gram. The relation between isolation of G. vaginalis and the presence of clue cells was 95.2%. There was a sensitivity of 95.2%, 100% specificity and a predictive positive value of 100%.

TI  - Specific immune response against Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin in patients with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to study the mucosal host response in bacterial vaginosis by evaluating the presence of a specific immune response elicited against the Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin in vaginal fluids of patients and by verifying its correlation with usual criteria adopted to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 123 white women attending the gynecologic care unit for urogenital complaints or for screening of uterine malignancies (Papanicolaou test) aged from 20 to 60 years, nonmenstruating, were enrolled. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed by clinical criteria and a Gram stain score > 6. RESULTS: We performed the determination of the antibody response in vaginal fluid against the hemolysin produced by G. vaginalis, a common agent present in bacterial vaginosis. The purified G. vaginalis toxin was a suitable antigen for detecting the presence of an immune response in the vaginal fluids of patients with bacterial vaginosis regardless of the strain of G. vaginalis present. A specific immunoglobulin A response was detected in 60% of women with overt bacterial vaginosis (Gram stain score > 6) and in 18.5% of women with intermediate vaginal flora (Gram stain score 4 to 6). The specificity of the test was 91%. CONCLUSIONS: We found a correlation between the specific local immune response to G. vaginalis toxin and bacterial vaginosis. The highly purified form of the toxin is able to discriminate disorders from the opportunistic colonization by G. vaginalis.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of DU-6859a and other fluoroquinolones against  Japanese isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of DU-6859a, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of other fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and Gardnerella vaginalis. DU-6859a was the most active agent; it inhibited 90% of isolates of almost all species tested, including Bacteroides fragilis at < or = 0.39 micrograms/mL. Although the other quinolones tested were active against gram-positive anaerobes, inhibiting their growth at < or = 1.56 micrograms/mL, these agents were less active against the B. fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (90% of which were inhibited at > or = 6.25 micrograms/mL). Mobiluncus species and G. vaginalis, which are well associated with bacterial vaginosis, were inhibited by DU-6859a at 0.1 microgram/mL. These results suggest that DU-6859a is a promising oral agent for the treatment of bacterial infections due to anaerobic bacteria; however, further studies, including determination of vaginal levels of this compound, should be performed to study the role of DU-6859a in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - [Screening for bacterial vaginosis in a population of pregnant women reporting to cardiotocographic tests].
AB  - Of 753 patients repeatedly controlled by nonstress test the incidence of bacterial vaginosis amounted to 11.28%. As regards the bacterial kinds isolated we have not noticed expressive differences in relation to the different periods of pregnancy, with the exception of the Candida albicans that instead has been the more frequent and in constant increase. Before the 30th week of pregnancy until the 35th, more variety of bacterial flora, with prevalence of aspecific vaginitis has been observed. The incidence of premature birth has been 5.86% for positive cases only and 0.66% for all cases controlled by nonstress test. In the five cases observed the bacterial kinds Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealitycum and Streptococci beta hemol of B group in association with Candida a. have been isolated.
TI  - [A new zoonosis--investigation of Gardnerella vaginalis disease of fox. V. Studies serotype of Gardnerella vaginalis in fox].
AB  - 145 strains Gardnerella vaginalis isolated in foxes were isolated from 13 main farms raising foxes in six provinces (regions), China, after antigenicity and immunogenicity of the strains were measured, 1-3 appropriate strains were selected from each farm raising foxes for serotype studies. Cross agglutinin absorption test confirmed that selected 26 strains Gardnerella vaginalis were divided into three serotypes and then the representing strains were used to produce typing serum. Among remaining 119 strain, 108 strains were typable with the typing sera, and 11 strains can't be set. Among three serotypes, serotype I made up 79.1% of the strains. It was shown that serotype I was the principal serotype of Gardnerella vaginalis of fox in China. The test also confirmed that 5 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from racoon dog, 4 strain Gardnerella vaginalis from mink and 2 strains Gardnerella vaginalis from canine also belonged to serotype I. Supersonic antigben was produced with three serotypes, representative strains. By agar immuno-diffusion test, it confirmed that the antigens of three serotypes formed a obvious blending precipitating line with the homologous or heterologous serotype antiserum. It indicated common antigen existed among all serotypes. The agar immuno-diffusion test results revealed that the precipitating line of the homologous serotype completely blended. It is our opinion that the method of serotyping is reliable.
TI  - [Microbiological study of some microorganisms implicated in sexually transmitted  diseases among the female prison population].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are of over greater interest, particularly since the appearance of the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) in the last decade. Asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infections are very frequent, overall in women. The aim of this study was to know the prevalence of certain STD producing microorganisms in a female penitentiary population, the clinical characteristics and evaluate the risk factors which may be found in this population. METHODS: One hundred thirty-three female prisoners attended in the Gynecology Ward of the Female Penitentiary of Carabanchel of Madrid, Spain, were studied over 13 months (from 30 April 1993 to 30 May, 1994). Vaginal and endocervical samples were taken in each case for microbiologic study by the usual methods. Demographic and clinical data were collected as were possible risk factors for acquiring STD (age of first sexual relations, sexual habits, intravenous drug addiction.
TI  - Vaginal microflora associated with bacterial vaginosis in Japanese and Thai pregnant women.
AB  - The vaginal flora of 118 Japanese and 208 Thai pregnant women were investigated for the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), BV-associated organisms, and BV-associated enzyme. A similar prevalence of BV was found among the Japanese (13.6%) and Thai women (15.9%). The microbial flora of women with BV were complex; the mean number of isolates recovered in the BV group was approximately 2 times more than that in a group of healthy women. Prevotella species, Porphyromonas species, Peptostreptococcus species, Mobiluncus species, Gardnerella vaginalis, and H2O2-nonproducing lactobacilli were significantly associated with BV. These organisms were less associated with H2O2-producing lactobacilli, which were predominant in women with normal flora, suggesting that H2O2-producing lactobacilli have antibacterial activity against BV-associated organisms. The vaginal sialidase assay by means of a filter-paper spot test was not proved to be a useful screening aid for diagnosis of BV because of the low sensitivity (69.4%) of this test.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an alteration of the vaginal flora, where the normally predominant lactobacilli are replaced by a cocktail of organisms including Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes. It presents with a grey, homogenous, offensive vaginal discharge that has a raised pH. However, around half the women with this condition are asymptomatic. Diagnosis is best made by microscopic examination of a Gram-stained smear of vaginal secretions. Treatment is with metronidazole or clindamycin. The indications for treatment of asymptomatic BV are not clear, but women should probably be treated before any invasive gynaecological procedure, including intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) insertion. BV during pregnancy is associated with preterm labour, although a causal effect is not proven; studies are in progress to determine whether treatment of BV will improve the outcome of these pregnancies.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: prevalence in an Italian population of asymptomatic pregnant women and diagnostic aspects.
AB  - The present study has been carried out with the main objective of determining the prevalence rate of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in a population of asymptomatic pregnant women (8th to 9th month of pregnancy). Out of a total 1,441 patients examined BV was found to be present in 70 (4.9%). The diagnosis was made when an analysis of the vaginal discharge revealed the simultaneous presence of at least three out of four of the following laboratory indices: (1) direct Gram stain positive (bacterial flora mixed with Gram-negative coccobacilli and variable-gram predominant over the lactobacillus flora); (2) pH > 4.5; (3) positive odour test with KOH 10%; (4) presence of clue cells. After a discussion of the principal laboratory and clinical signs presently used for the diagnosis of BV, the authors suggest the exclusion of the evaluation of the appearance of the vaginal discharge from the standard diagnostic criteria. Further, three diagnostic methods are hypothesized for use in different settings.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: distribution of bacterial species in different  gram-stain categories of the vaginal flora.
AB  - Vaginal swabs for microbiological culture were taken from 174 pregnant women whose vaginal flora had been evaluated by Gram's stain; 50 had grade III flora (bacterial vaginosis, BV), 50 grade II (intermediate), 41 had vaginal flora graded as abnormal which then reverted to grade I (revertants) and 33 had normal flora (controls). The aim was to determine whether bacterial species isolated from women with grade II flora differed from those with grade III flora. Isolation of Lactobacillus spp. decreased from grade I to grade III and that of other aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species increased. There was little difference in the species isolated from women with grade II and grade III flora, but there was a distinct order in which organisms in different species increased in numbers. The vaginal flora of revertants was intermediate between that of healthy controls and those with grade II flora. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from a greater number of revertants than grade I controls but the incidence did not increase in grade II or grade III. Bifidobacterium spp. were isolated from a greater number of revertants than grade I controls and increased further in grade II and grade III. However, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis were isolated from a much larger number of women with grade III flora than the other groups. The conclusion is that grade II is a transitional phase between grade I and grade III and that some organisms such as G. vaginalis and M. hominis only reach large numbers in the late stage. The sequence of appearance of the various bacterial species may be a result of the pathophysiological alteration of the vaginal ecosystem associated with BV.
TI  - Defining bacterial vaginosis: to BV or not to BV, that is the question.
AB  - The history of bacterial vaginosis (BV), now extending over more than 40 years, has been remarkable not only in terms of repeatedly changing the name of the bacterium that we now know as Gardnerella vaginalis but also in relation to what is thought to constitute the condition, what it should be called and how the diagnosis can best be made. The composite clinical criteria are often confusing for the nonspecialist, provide room for inter-observer error, and misinterpretation of just one criterion can lead to considerable over or under diagnosis. There is no doubt that diagnosis should be through a Gram-stained vaginal smear, allowing detection not only of 'full blown' BV but also patterns of vaginal flora that while not in this category are nevertheless abnormal. Accurate diagnosis is important in view of the ever-growing list of other important conditions that may occur as a consequence of the abnormal flora. In addition to this, we raise the question of whether the name and abbreviation BV is the best either scientifically or from the point of view of the lay public. While recognizing that it now may be too ingrained for further change, is it possible to have a better term, at least for lay use?
TI  - Polyphasic approach to the classification and identification of Gardnerella vaginalis and unidentified Gardnerella vaginalis-like coryneforms present in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A taxonomic study of Gardnerella vaginalis and G. vaginalis-like coryneforms was  performed in order to clarify the phylogenetic affiliation of these organisms and to improve future identification. We examined 50 strains by performing whole-cell protein and fatty acid analyses, a 16S rRNA sequence analysis, and an extensive phenotypic characterization analysis. The results of both chemotaxonomic techniques which we used divided the organisms into two main clusters, and the 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that the clusters represent different genera, which were easily distinguished by the results of classical phenotypic tests. The cluster I strains were identified as G. vaginalis, which was shown to be a close relative of the genus Bifidobacterium. An improved description of G. vaginalis is presented. The cluster II strains belong to or are closely related to Actinomyces turicensis.
TI  - Bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. METHODS: Ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. Blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within 15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. Chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. Demographic, labor, delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS: Bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. Bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (P = .02). Isolates included group B streptococcus (n = 5), Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of Prevotella bivia, G vaginalis, and viridans streptococci (n = 1). Bacteremia was associated with earlier median gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. After adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. CONCLUSION: Bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. Many of the isolates are capable of causing endocarditis. Appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.
TI  - Biotypes of Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from urinary tract.
AB  - A modified scheme is proposed for biotyping Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from urinary tract of symptomatic and asymptomatic women based on detection of hippurate hydrolysis, beta-galactosidase (ONPG) and lipase, and fermentation of arabinose, galactose and xylose. Thirty biotypes were found among 73 strains. The distribution of biotypes was similar in both populations but the biotypes 1H, 5G and 7G were found more frequently in women without symptoms of urinary tract infection.
TI  - [Detection of bacterial vaginosis in gram stained vaginal smears and papanicolaou stained cervical smears].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) by papanicolaou (PAP)-stained cervical smears and gram-stained vaginal smears according to clinical criteria. METHODS: In the prospective study of 196 non-pregnant women of child-bearing age, 94 were clinically diagnosed to have BV. Gram-stained vaginal smears and PAP-stained cervical smears were collected from all enrolled patients. RESULTS: In comparison with clinical diagnosis of BV, the sensitivity and specificity of gram-stained vaginal smears and PAP-stained cervical smears were 94.7% (89/94), 98.0% (100/102) 85.1% (80/94), and 95.1% (97/102). The characteristics of BV in gram-stained vaginal smears and PAP-stained cervical smears included small bacteria of Gardnerella and bacteroides morphotypes and curved gram variable rods and absence of bacteria of Lactobacillus morphotypes. CONCLUSION: It is possible to screen and manage BV according to Gram-stained vaginal smears or PAP-stained cervical smears.
TI  - Composition of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB  - One hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Candida albicans. Mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. Although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the L. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. Isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the L. acidophilus complex. Data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (P-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the L. acidophilus complex. DNA-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. Most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to L. gasseri CIP 102991T by the technique of DNA/DNA hybridization.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test for bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new rapid diagnostic test for bacterial vaginosis. DESIGN: Comparison of a new biochemical diamine test with low technology tests and microbiological culture. SETTING: General practice, family planning clinic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of the new diamine test with microbiological culture for Gardnerella vaginalis, with clue cells, and with the amine test. RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty-nine vaginal swabs were assayed quantitatively by the new diamine test. When compared with microbiological culture of Gardnerella vaginalis, the sensitivities and specificities were 86% and 81%, respectively. When compared with clue cell findings, the sensitivities and specificities were 97% and 83%, respectively. In the third comparison with the amine test the sensitivity was 94% and the specificity was 84%. Since microbiological diagnosis of organisms related to bacterial vaginosis is difficult, the new test and existing sideroom tests may be more sensitive to the condition and the true frequency of false positives may be less than the specificity in this study suggests. CONCLUSIONS: The new diamine test is accurate, sensitive and specific, and provides the basis for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Such a test is needed if bacterial vaginosis is to be diagnosed and managed effectively in both general and specialist practice.
TI  - Growth inhibition of metronidazole-susceptible and metronidazole-resistant strains of Gardnerella vaginalis by Lactobacilli in vitro.
AB  - Metronidazole resistance was produced in susceptible Gardnerella vaginalis after  subculture in the presence of metronidazole. Metronidazole-resistant gardnerellae were less susceptible to growth inhibition by Lactobacillus culture filtrates. A low pH (+/- 4) and lactic acid accounted for 60 to 95% of inhibitory activity, and H2O2 accounted for only 0 to 30%. However, in the presence of myeloperoxidase, H2O2-producing lactobacilli decreased the viability of metronidazole-susceptible gardnerellae 2,000-fold.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis in reports of cervico-vaginal cytology].
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is a microorganism of great importance because of its participation in some gynecological diseases. Data contained in 3421 cervicovaginal cytology reports obtained from the Profamilia Clinic, Cartagena, Colombia between June 1993 and February 1994 were analyzed retrospectively and analytically. Cells suggestive of Gardnerella vaginalis were found in 723 reports, the greatest proportion being in the 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 year-old age groups (without statistical significance). There is a high frequency of Gardnerella vaginalis as related to healthy cervix and flux. Among the population with Gardnerella vaginalis a low percentage of neoplasia and non-classified atypical cell were found inflammatory reaction was reported in more than half of the cases. In 95% of the reports, Gardnerella vaginalis was the only agent found, the remaining 5% had associated HVP, fungus and trichomonas. Because of the medical staff responsible for taking the samples, cervico-vaginal cytology is an effective method for studying the state of the vagina and cervix.
TI  - Etiologic study of genitourinary infections in women of childbearing age in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, 1992.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Genitourinary infections have a major impact on public health, especially in Africa. Relative distribution of the different pathogens is unknown in Bobo-Dioulasso. GOAL: To describe the etiology of genitourinary infections, to establish the sensitivity of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to antibiotics, and to provide epidemiologic and biologic evidence to optimize the treatment of genitourinary infections. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical and biologic diagnoses were performed on 223 women with genitourinary infections. RESULTS: Etiologies found were trichomoniasis (27.8%), chlamydia (26.9%), bacterial vaginosis (19.7%), candidiasis (16.6), and N. gonorrhoeae infection (10.9%). Human immune deficiency virus antibodies were present in 42% of the patients. Spectinomycin or ceftriaxone should be recommended for the treatment of gonorrhoeae in Bobo-Dioulasso. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis is higher than that of N. gonorrhoeae in Bobo-Dioulasso. This should be taken into account in clinical management of sexually transmitted diseases in this setting.

TI  - Streptococcus agalactiae: a vaginal pathogen?
AB  - The significance of Streptococcus agalactiae as an aetiological agent in vaginitis was evaluated. A total of 6226 samples from women who presented with vaginal symptoms was examined. The presence of >10 leucocytes/high-power field (h.p.f.) was taken to be the criterion of active infection. S. agalactiae was isolated from 10.1% of these samples. The isolation rates of other common pathogens such as Candida spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Trichomonas spp. were 54.1%, 27.2% and 4.2%, respectively, in the same group of patients. In contrast, the isolation rates of these micro-organisms in the group of patients who had no infection (<10 leucocytes/h.p.f.) were 4.2%, 38.3%, 33% and 0.5%, respectively. In the majority of samples from which S. agalactiae was isolated, it was the sole pathogen isolated (83%) and its presence was associated with an inflammatory response in 80% of patients. Furthermore, the relative risk of vaginal infection with S. agalactiae (2.38) in patients with purulent vaginal discharge was greater than that of Candida spp. infection (1.41) and lower than that of Trichomonas spp. infection (8.32). These data suggest that S. agalactiae in symptomatic women with microscopic evidence of inflammation should be considered a causative agent of vaginitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the occurrence of low-trait genital infection and cervical epithelial dysplasia in women from a South-american indian tribe in the Brazilian Amazonia. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of women older than 10 years from two indian settlements of the Parakana tribe: Paranatinga and Maroxewara. Demographic data and information about sexual behavior as well as obstetric/gynaecological history were recorded. Two gynecologists examined 80 patients (89.9%), and collected vaginal and cervical specimens of 69 indians for further laboratory analysis, by Gram stain and Papanicolaou method. Fourteen (20.3%) women resulted to be pregnant. RESULTS: Parakana women begin sexual activity early, after menarche; they have multiple sexual partners; are multiparous. Some of his partners already had intercourse with women of our society. In Paranatinga, vaginal discharges were a very frequent sign and not age-related, and women presented high frequency of disturbances on lactobacilli flora, greater than among inhabitants of Maroxewara. Pap smears in 91.5% of all patients showed inflammatory pattern. When found an possible etiologic agent (61.3%), in 63.4% it was Gardnerella vaginalis, in 7.3% Trichomonas vaginalis and in 4.9% Candida sp. In 23.2% of smears cythophatic signs related to infection by human papillomavirus were identified. One case had morphological changes compatible with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade I, another with CIN II and, in a 48 year old indian, cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Near all women had some grade of cervical disease. Measure HPV-infection prevalence among Parakana indians with adequate methods may improve our understanding about worldwide occurrence of HPV infections. Established risk factors for cancer of the cervix and sexually transmitted diseases were common in this tribe.
TI  - Pathogenic potential of Gardnerella vaginalis on the female urogenital system.
AB  - The prevalence of certain characteristics of genital discharge like (a) watery variety in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic 34% and in gynaecology clinic 26.6%, (b) fishy odour in STD clinic 29.2% and in gynaecology clinic 12.2% and (c) pH > 4.5 in STD clinic 53.6% and in gynaecology clinic 43% was notable. On the other hand, occurrence of "clue cells" (in STD clinic 41.4% and in gynaecology clinic 39.5%) did not show difference in the aforesaid clinics. The preponderance of watery discharge in the STD clinic appears to be related to G vaginalis (in STD clinic 26.8% and in gynaecology clinic 9.3%). It is intriguing to note that G vaginalis was isolated from leucorrhoea (in STD clinic 19.5% and in gynaecology clinic 9.3%) and inapparent (in 10%) cases and normal (in 4.2%) cases. Single infection with G vaginalis in one particular case had profuse watery discharge, pH > 4.5 and there was occurrence of "clue cells". Likewise, in multiple infections revealing G vaginalis (29 cases) as one of the potential agents, 78.5% had profuse, 53.8% watery discharge of which 53.5% had "clue cells" and 81% had pH > 4.5. In mixed type of infections, the U urealyticum (53.8%) and M hominis (30.6%) were conspicuous in bacterial vaginosis. Cervicitis, erosion cervix or urethral syndrome were unrelated to G vaginalis. All cases of G vaginalis infection responded to metronidazole with remission of leucorrhoea in 25.9% cases.
TI  - Bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - One hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (BV) were enrolled in this study. The bacteriological epidemiology of BV and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of BV were investigated. The epidemiology of BV was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. Fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (CLDM) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. The major organisms occurring were Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus species, Bacteroides species, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The therapeutic efficacy of CLDM cream on BV appeared to be preferable to oral MTN from clinical and bacteriological aspects. The clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of MTN and CLDM in the treatment of BV suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Genomic DNA fingerprint analysis of biotype 1 Gardnerella vaginalis from patients with and without bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Of the 20 biotype 1 Gardnerella vaginalis isolates analyzed, 10 from patients with bacterial vaginosis and 10 from patients without bacterial vaginosis, none shared the same DNA fingerprint. However, a 1.18-kb HindIII fragment was common among 18 of the 20 biotype 1 isolates in a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with a 7.9-kb G. vaginalis DNA probe.
TI  - In-vitro activity of purpuromycin and MDL 63,604 against microorganisms that cause vaginitis and vaginosis.
AB  - Purpuromycin and its semi-synthetic derivative MDL 63,604 had in-vitro activity similar to that of amphotericin B against isolates of Candida albicans. MDL 63,604 had activity similar to that of metronidazole against Trichomonas vaginalis. Both compounds were very active against most species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes and against Gardnerella vaginalis. MDL 63,604 had significantly lower MICs than purpuromycin against T. vaginalis and most of the bacteria, probably due to antagonism of purpuromycin's activity by medium supplements (blood or serum). Purpuromycin or related compounds may have a potential role in the topical treatment of vaginitis and vaginosis.

TI  - Office laboratory diagnosis of vaginitis. Clinician-performed tests compared with a rapid nucleic acid hybridization test.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The traditional diagnosis of vaginitis incorporates patient symptoms, clinical findings observed during vaginal examination, and laboratory analysis of vaginal fluid. The purpose of this study was to evaluate routine clinician-performed office laboratory diagnostic techniques for women with abnormal vaginal symptoms, and to compare these results with those obtained by a DNA hybridization test for Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Candida species. METHODS: The study included 501 symptomatic women who were between the ages of 14 and 67 years. Three vaginal specimens were obtained for saline wet mount, potassium hydroxide (KOH) prep, amine "sniff", pH, and nucleic acid hybridization (T vaginalis, G vaginalis, and Candida sp) tests. Clinicians and medical technicians independently evaluated the wet mount, KOH prep, amine, and pH tests. A medical technician processed the DNA tests according to manufacturer's protocol. RESULTS: Of 499 subjects for whom complete data were available, vulvovaginal candidiasis was diagnosed in 20.0%, vaginal trichomoniasis in 7.4%, and bacterial vaginosis in 52.1%. Fourteen percent of subjects had multiple vaginal infections. The sensitivity and specificity of clinician microscopically diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis were 39.6% and 90.4%, 75.0% and 96.6%, and 76.5% and 70.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the DNA probe diagnosis of the same types of vaginitis were 75.0% and 95.7%, 86.5% and 98.5%, and 95.4% and 60.7%, respectively. When only women with multiple vaginal infections were considered, the percentages of correct clinician diagnoses for vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis were 49.3%, 83.6%, and 59.7%, respectively. For the DNA probe test, the percentages of correct diagnoses were 72.9%, 92.9%, and 90.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care clinicians demonstrated a high specificity but low sensitivity when identifying vaginal trichomoniasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis by microscopic techniques. Correct microscopic diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was even more difficult for clinicians, as was the diagnosis of multiple vaginal infections. Clinicians were not as accurate as the DNA probe test in diagnosing vaginal infections. Clinicians need more education in the laboratory diagnosis of vaginitis. Clinicians should carefully scrutinize each microscopic slide, systematically examine the slide for each type of vaginitis, and consider specimen pH and the presence of leukocytes, Lactobacillus organisms, or amine odor as additional clues to infection.
TI  - Papillomavirus in cervicovaginal smears of women infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - It has been described that women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) present more frequent cytological abnormalities in cervicovaginal smears, generally related to infection by human papillomavirus (HPV). The present work is a study of cervicovaginal smears of 147 HIV-seropositive women submitted to routine gynecological examinations. The smears were stained by the Papanicolaou method. Cytopathic effects of HPV were found in 38 (25.8%) cases. Nuclear atypias of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were evident in 36 (24.5%) of these cases: 27 (18.4%), CIN I; 6 (4.0%), CIN II and 3 (2.0%) CIN III. Also 2 (1.4%) invasive carcinomas and one (0.7%) endocervical dysplasia were found. Other agents observed were: Candida sp, 19 (12.9%) cases, Gardnerella vaginalis, 19 (12.9%), Trichomonas vaginalis, 13 (8.4%), Chlamydia trachomatis 5 (3.4%), Mobiluncus sp 2 (1.4%) and Herpes simplex virus 1 (0.7%). This study emphasizes the high frequency of HPV/CIN cervicovaginal abnormalities in HIV-seropositive in our population. It is possible that immunological factors and sexual promiscuity are involved in this phenomenon.

TI  - Epidemiologic differences between candidial and trichomonal infections as detected in cytologic smears in Taiwan.
AB  - The epidemiologic differences between cytology-detected candidial and trichomonal infections were assessed in 15,933 women attending the 12 district health centres in the Taipei area and a consecutive 1114 patients, visiting venereal disease clinics, whose smears were screened for cervical cancer between July 1991 and December 1992 in Taipei. The Pap smears were examined for the presence of specific organisms, such as trichomonas vaginalis, vaginal candida, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, actinomyces, leptothrix, aspergillu, gardnerella and others. More emphasis was placed on the candidial and trichomonal infection in inflammatory Pap smears. The overall prevalence of candidial and trichomonal infections was 3.40% and 1.88%, respectively. There were striking differences in the prevalence of trichomoniasis ranging from 1.74% in the district health centre population to 3.77% in the venereal disease clinic patients; however, the prevalence of candidial infection remained the same (3.40%) in these two distinct population groups. Indices of socioeconomic status--education and personal hygiene--showed an inverse association with the prevalence of trichomoniasis but a positive correlation with candidiasis. Among participants, younger age (< 20 years old) was independently associated with candidial (OR = 1.95) and trichomonal (OR = 3.87) infections. No sexual behavioural factors were associated with candidial infection in this study; however, having multiple sexual partners (OR = 5.07) was associated with a significantly elevated risk of trichomoniasis, while using condoms was associated with a diminished risk (OR = 0.38). The presence of candidiasis and trichomoniasis was highly associated with abnormal cytologic findings, particularly those indicative of inflammation. There was little evidence that findings suggestive of cervical cancer could be attributed to either candidial or trichomonal infections. These data suggest that trichomoniasis is consistent with venereal transmission of the disease, but transmission by contaminated objects cannot be ruled out because there is an increased relation between trichomoniasis infection and socioeconomic conditions and personal hygiene. Elucidation of such differences may be helpful in designing different strategies to control these infections. Furthermore, the findings can provide a good baseline of prevalence for investigating the relationship between these two pathogens and cervical dysplasia.
TI  - Treatment of bacterial vaginosis: a comparison of oral metronidazole, metronidazole vaginal gel, and clindamycin vaginal cream.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment options for bacterial vaginosis are numerous. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of oral metronidazole, metronidazole vaginal gel, and clindamycin vaginal cream for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis using traditional clinical and laboratory methods, as well as a new DNA probe test. We also determined the percentage of patients receiving each treatment who developed posttreatment vaginal candidiasis, a potential complication of treating bacterial vaginosis. METHODS: One hundred one women in whom bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed by standard criteria were randomly assigned to receive: oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 1 week, 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel 5 g twice daily for 5 days, or 2% clindamycin vaginal cream 5 g once daily for 7 days. Women with coexisting vulvovaginal candidiasis or vaginal trichomoniasis were excluded. Tests of cure by vaginal saline wet prep and potassium hydroxide microscopic examinations, Gram's stain, pH and DNA probe tests for Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida species were scheduled 7 to 14 days following treatment. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in cure rates for oral metronidazole (84.2%), metronidazole vaginal gel (75.0%), or clindamycin vaginal cream (86.2%) (chi 2 = 1.204, df = 2, P = .548) using traditional clinical and laboratory criteria. Cure rates were lower based on DNA testing, indicating that Gardnerella vaginalis may remain after a clinical cure. This would explain cases of recurrent disease. Posttreatment vulvovaginal candidiasis was experienced by 12.5% of subjects treated with oral metronidazole, 14.8% of subjects treated with clindamycin vaginal cream, and 30.4% of subjects treated with metronidazole vaginal gel (chi 2 = 2.607, df = 2, P = .272). CONCLUSIONS: Oral metronidazole, metronidazole vaginal gel, and clindamycin vaginal cream achieved nearly equivalent cure rates for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Patients treated with these agents experienced similar rates of posttreatment vulvovaginal candidiasis, but those using the intravaginal products reported being more satisfied with the treatment.
TI  - Sexually transmitted diseases in children and evidence of sexual abuse.
AB  - During the period June 1989 to March 1991, laboratory evidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) was found in 107 patients at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital in Cape Town. Data was available on 96 patients aged 23 months to 14 years (mean 75.9 months). Vaginal discharge was the most frequent presenting symptom (76%), particularly in those less than 5 years of age (90%). Although a history of abuse was not given on presentation in 62%, evidence of abuse was subsequently elicited in 67% of patients. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was the most common sexual pathogen (61 isolates, 8 penicillin resistant), followed by G vaginalis (17 isolates), Trichomonas vaginalis (7 infections), and T pallidum (9 TPHA positive, 5 with VDRL 1:4 or higher). Chlamydia trachomatis was demonstrated by immunofluorescence in 14 children. Multiple STDs were demonstrated in 10 patients. Although evidence of CSA was not found in all patients with STDs it was likely that the vast majority of patients had acquired these infections by CSA. Symptomatic prepubertal children with G vaginalis isolates should be investigated for CSA. Chlamydial immunofluorescence tests did not assist the diagnosis of CSA in children and should not be used, as they have no medicolegal significance.

TI  - [Diagnosis and treatment of bacterial vaginosis by general practitioners].
AB  - In order to evaluate which diagnostic procedures and treatments general practitioners (GP) used for bacterial vaginosis, and to describe their knowledge of the disease, all the GPs in two counties were asked to fill in a questionnaire. Two hundred and sixty-six (59%) answered. The GP used the criteria of Amsel in 9%, the wet smear criteria in 12%, clue cells in 6%, the amine test in 30%, culture of Gardnerella vaginalis in 29%, 8% only used clinical examination and 6% did not use any criteria. Many examinations were carried out unnecessarily. Sixty-six percent stated that they had a sufficient knowledge of bacterial vaginosis, 36% had knowledge of the criteria of Amsel, 78% of the definition of clue cells and 58% considered culture of Gardnerella vaginalis as being diagnostically useful. Seventy-one percent used metronidazole for treatment. Treatment of the sexual partner was carried out in 33%. In conclusion, we recommend introduction of a more simple criterion than the criteria of Amsel.

AB  - 192 Gardnerella vaginalis antibody positive sera from artifically infected foxes, immunized foxes and foxes that the bacterial examination were positive were analysed by the established Dot-ELISA. The results showed that 187/192 were positive, the positive rate was 97.3%. Block and cross tests showed that the method was specific. The method was 28.1 times sensitive as PAT and 5.5 times sensitive as MAT respectively. The repeatability of the test was good and the positive coincidence rate among the three techniques was 100%.
TI  - The genital flora of women with intraamniotic infection. Vaginal Infection and Prematurity Study Group.
AB  - The relationship of genital flora assessed at the end of the second trimester of  pregnancy and intraamniotic infection diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms during labor was evaluated. Women were enrolled at 23-26 weeks of gestation and followed through delivery in the multi-center Vaginal Infections and Prematurity Study (1984-1989). Among the cohort of 11,989 followed through delivery, 286 (2.4%) developed intraamniotic infection. The recovery of Gardnerella vaginalis (relative risk [RR] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4-2.4), heavy growth of Bacteroides species (RR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1), and isolation of Mycoplasma hominis (RR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.3-2.1) from the vagina at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of intraamniotic infection. Bacterial vaginosis was also associated with intraamniotic infection (RR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.2). These findings extend prior studies by showing that prenatal cultures for microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis predicted an increased risk of intraamniotic infection.
TI  - [A new zoonosis--investigation of Gardnerella vaginalis disease of fox. III. Epidemiological investigation].
AB  - By epidemiological investigation to Gardnerella vaginalis disease of fox of civil main farms raising foxes, this disease was showed to be susceptible to silver foxes, arctic foxes, red foxes and color foxes, the disease was mostly transmitted by copulation, infected foxes played the leading role in epidemic of the disease. Investigative results of all farms raising foxes showed infection rate of fox groups was 0.9-21.9%, resulting in abortion rate was 1.5-14.7%, empty rate was 3.2-47.5%. Serious harm was revealed to the disease. By serology and causative agent isolation, we had proved that the disease was able to infect feeder and manager, it belongs to zoonosis. Racoondog. mink and canine infect with the disease besides fox. White mouse, big white rat, gopher, guinea pig and rabbit for laboratory are not infected with the disease.
TI  - Development of a species-specific polymerase chain reaction assay for Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes of the facultative anaerobic bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis has been determined, together with the 5' proximal 500 nucleotides of the 23S rRNA gene. Regions suited for the development of specific, probe-confirmable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were selected. PCR assays were evaluated with respect to sensitivity and specificity, the latter in comparison with a number of G. vaginalis reference strains and closely related species like Bifidobacterium spp. In an initial diagnostic study it appeared that the PCR test detected G. vaginalis in 40% of women irrespective of their clinical status. Ten out of 11 patients suffering from bacterial vaginosis as defined on the basis of clinical parameters were carrying G. vaginalis.
TI  - [Frequency of isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum in an open population from southern Mexico City].
AB  - Vaginal cultures for Ureaplasma urealyticum and confidential questionnaires were  obtained from women with signs and symptoms of vaginitis who consulted a physician at a Primary Health Center, Tlalpan, D.F., Mexico. In all 220 women were studied, 50 (22.7%) of whom were colonized with Ureaplasma urealyticum, statistical analysis (X2) showed there was no association between colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum, and age, pregnancy, and other but there was association between colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum and the number of pregnancies and no birth control method use.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis infection in heterosexual couples. Ultrastructural study of desquamation cells of the stratified epithelium].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent infections during the woman's reproductive age. Lactobacilli normal flora is substituted by relatively elevated Gardnerella vaginalis (GV), anaerobic bacteroids, Mobiluncus and Mycoplasma. The purpose of this study is to perform a morphological analysis of possible mechanisms for adhesion and penetration of GV in the heterosexual couple, in squamous epithelium at vaginal wall, as well as in seminal fluid. Ten couples with positive GV culture with three to four days of abstinence, were studied. The women presented with at least three of the four Amsel's criteria. Samples were obtained from vaginal lateral walls and from seminal fluid; these were divided in two parts: 1. To realize cultures for GV. Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis; and 2. For an ultrastructural analysis. Samples were processed with common techniques for electronic microscopy. In vaginal cells, bacteria similar to GV free form fixed to plasmatic membrane and inside the cellular cytoplasm. In the seminal fluid there were found numerous urethral cells of desquamation, which presented, as well as in woman, free form bacteria, fixed to plasmatic membrane and inside the cytoplasm. In four cases, bacteria similar to Mycoplasma, were found; and one case with particles suggesting cytomegalovirus. It is concluded in this study that: 1. The male presents with urethral cells similar to vaginal "guide cells". 2. GV colonizes urethral epithelium in the male. 3. Male is capable of infecting and/or re-infecting the woman.
TI  - [The isolation of Streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  - We have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by Gynecology Service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. We achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58 (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to Streptococcus morbillorum 9 (15.5%), to Gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to Enterococcus faecalis-durans and to Streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to Streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to Streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to Streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis II respectively. We previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. The bacteriological identification done by the API 20 STREP System (bioMerieux GmbH, Nutingen, Germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the Streptococcus morbillorum.
TI  - Sterility of the uterine cavity.
AB  - In a prospective open study the sterility of the uterine cavity was evaluated in  99 women admitted for hysterectomy. The indications for hysterectomy were in most cases persistent irregular vaginal bleeding and fibromyomas of the uterus. Samples for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Chlamydia trachomatis, yeasts and viruses were taken preoperatively from the apex of the vagina and cervical os. Immediately after hysterectomy the uterus was opened under sterile conditions and samples obtained from the isthmus and fundus of the uterine cavity for microbiological examination. Wet smears were taken from the same sites. Nearly a quarter of all the patients harbored one or more microorganisms in the uterus, mostly Gardnerella vaginalis, Enterobacter and Streptococcus agalactiae. We found that in a significant number of cases, the uterine cavity is colonized with potentially pathogenic organisms which may play a causative role in endometritis. The results indicate that inflammation of the uterine cavity should be evaluated by hysteroscopic examination before hysterectomy is undertaken in patients with persistent irregular vaginal bleeding.

TI  - Genital ulcer disease in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and microbiologic characteristics of genital ulcer disease in a population of human immunodeficiency virus-infected women. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was performed in university-affiliated, hospital-based women's human immunodeficiency virus clinics. A total of 307 women with human immunodeficiency virus infection were followed up during 20 months. There were no interventions. Age, race, CD4+ cell counts, bacteriologic and virologic analyses in cases of ulcers, serologic testing for syphilis, and histopathologic examination in selected cases (n = 6). RESULTS: Among 307 women followed up over a 20-month period, 43 ulcers were detected with a prevalence of 14%. Among the ulcer cases the average absolute CD4+ lymphocyte number was 210/mm3. Diagnostic evaluation yielded no proven etiologic agent in 26 (60%) of the cases. Twelve of the 43 cases (28%) were positive for herpes simplex-2. Five cases (12%) yielded unusual or mixed bacteriologic types. No cases were attributable to primary syphilis infection. One case each of an ulcer infected with cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Gardnerella vaginalis, as well as three unusual presentations of herpetic ulcers, is analyzed in detail. CONCLUSION: These cases exemplify the often dramatic presentation of human immunodeficiency virus-related genital ulcers and the clinical complexity of both diagnosis and management. The frequent lack of an infectious or neoplastic cause in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women with genital ulcer disease suggests that human immunodeficiency virus may play a local role in causation or exacerbation. Biopsies of atypical genital ulcers should be considered to aid diagnosis. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of genital ulcer disease in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.
TI  - [A new zoonosis--investigation of Gardnerella vaginalis disease of fox. II. Identification of pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - 16 strains isolated from aborted foetus and vaginal exeretions of foxes were used for examination of cell morphology including fine structure of the cell wall and septa, test for homolysis, biochemical reactions and analysis of G+C content of the bacterial DNA. The cells are pleomorphic bacilli and coccobacilli, Gram stain reaction appear positive to variable, catalse and oxidase-negative, with a fermentative type of glucose metabolism, giving acetic and lactic acid as the major end products of fermentation. It's differentiated from the human strains of G. vaginalis by its less fastidious in growth requirements and being facultatively anaerobic to aerobic. We propose the name: a new subspecies--Gardnerella vaginalis subsp. fox, the type strain is U80.
TI  - [A new zoonosis--investigation of Gardnerella vaginalis disease of fox. I. Causative agent isolation and artificial infection].
AB  - It is the first time that this paper reports on using improved rabbit blood agar  culture medium to isolate 145 strains Gardnerella vaginalis from the foxes and their abortion fortus organs of main fox farms. Among the strains, 26 strains were isolated from the abortion foetus organs, isolation rate was 92.86%; 118 strains were isolated from the vaginal exeretion of the abortion and empty foxes, isolation rate was 34.01%; 1 strain was isolated from inguinal lymph node of the pelted positive fox, isolation rate was 2%. None was isolated from blood. By causative agent isolation, we revealed the bacterium survival position in vivo, and the best isolation route isolation opportunity and isolation methods were selected. By artificial infection test, we have proved pathogenicity of the bacterium.
TI  - In vitro ability of the group B streptococci to inhibit gram-positive and gram-variable constituents of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of septicemic and nonsepticemic isolates of group B streptococci (GBS) to inhibit in vitro the principal bacterial groups found in the normal bacterial flora of the female genital tract. METHODS: The target groups were composed of 1) 10 strains each of the following: viridans streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci (not group B or D), group A streptococci, GBS, peptostreptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Gardnerella vaginalis; 2) 9 strains of enterococci; 3) 9 strains of group C or G streptococci; 4) 7 strains of lactobacilli; and 5) 7 strains of diphtheroids. All target groups were tested for inhibition by a test panel of either a group of 10 or 41 GBS isolates. If the GBS isolates failed to inhibit a target group, that group was tested for its ability to inhibit the GBS test panel. RESULTS: The GBS test panel did not inhibit the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci or S. aureus but uniformly inhibited groups A, B, C, and G streptococci, lactobacilli, and G. vaginalis. One of the 7 strains of diphtheroids was inhibited by 37 of the 41 GBS isolates; the other 6 strains of diphtheroids were uniformly inhibited. Variable inhibition by GBS was observed with viridans streptococci, nonhemolytic (not group B or D) streptococci, peptostreptococci, and enterococci; however, inhibition or noninhibition was uniform for a given target strain against the entire GBS test panel. The 23 GBS isolates obtained from septicemic neonates or adults did not differ from the 18 nonsepticemic isolates in their ability to inhibit other species of streptococci or other gram-positive or gram-variable constituents of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract. When converse testing was done, all 10 GBS isolates were uniformly inhibited by coagulase-negative staphylococci and by the majority of enterococci, but were not inhibited by S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GBS may be significant regulators of other beta-hemolytic streptococci, diphtheroids, lactobacilli, and G. vaginalis within the bacterial flora of the female genital tract. Moreover, the absence of GBS in the vaginal flora may be the result of mediation by coagulase-negative staphylococci and selected strains of enterococci.
TI  - [Balanitis and infectious agents. A prospective study of 100 cases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the Centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the St. Louis Hospital in Paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. All underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. Sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. Two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. RESULTS: Candida albicans (CA) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. A pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus milleri, group HB5) was found without CA in 28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group D streptococci) was found without CA in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. DISCUSSION: This series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with and without balanitis (p < 0.9). The role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? The significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. The clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis biotypes: modification of a proposed system].
AB  - A modified scheme is proposed for biotyping Gardnerella vaginalis based on detection of hippurate hydrolysis, beta-galactosidase (ONPG) and lipase, and fermentation of arabinose, galactose and xylose. Thirty three biotypes were found among 140 strains from women with and without bacterial vaginosis (non-specific vaginitis). The distribution of biotypes were found to be significantly different, being more predominant the biotypes 1A; 5G; 7A; 7D and 7G in women with vaginosis and the biotypes 5G and 6H in women without vaginosis. These data suggest that some biotypes of Gardnerella vaginalis are associated with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis during chemotherapy for gynecological neoplasms. A therapeutic proposal].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a well characterized disease, defined Amsel's criteria, whose incidence is significantly increased during chemotherapy for gynecologic malignancies, as previously reported by the authors. Nine patients out of 14 (64%) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for gynecologic tumors showed a clinical and laboratory evidence of bacterial vaginosis and were treated with cetyltrimethilammonium naproxenate vaginal douches. Results were analyzed up to the completion of oncologic chemotherapy: a high efficacy and tolerability for the topical treatment was demonstrated in all cases.
TI  - [Bacteriological findings in patients with cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia].
AB  - In order to evaluate the cervical flora in patients with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (grades I to III) the microbiologic results of 216 patients with CIN were compared with those of 100 symptom free controls. Gardnerella vaginalis combined with Mykoplasma spp. and Bacteroides spp. were found in 22% of the patients with dysplasia and in 5% of the control group. The difference was significant (p < 0.004). Microorganisms causing sexually transmitted diseases like Neisseria gonoroheae and Trichomonas vaginalis were not found. Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in 5% of all CIN groups. Comparing patients with CIN I, CIN II and CIN III, we did not notice any difference in their bacterial flora, wet smear or smell test. However the results of this study indicate that women with cervical dysplasia may have a higher prevalence of an altered cervical flora in comparison to controls.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: drugs versus alternative treatment.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is one of the most common infectious disorders affecting women. It is caused by several microorganisms, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, beta-streptococci and mobiluncus/falcivibrio sp. Bacterial vaginosis is thought to occur as a result of a change in vaginal pH mediated by the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria. This rise in vaginal pH interferes with the activity of vaginal lactobacilli which maintain vaginal acidity. Several types of antibiotics have been used to treat this condition. Although metronidazole was found to be the most effective, none was completely successful in either cure or prevention. Several attempts have recently been made to treat bacterial vaginosis using physiological or 'natural' substances, such as lactate gel and commercial yoghurt, which is acidic and also contains lactobacillus strains. This kind of treatment looks promising and may have a place in certain clinical conditions, including pregnancy, in cases of recurrent inflammation, or as a prophylactic treatment before invasive gynecological procedures or abdominal surgery in patients known to be affected. This issue should be additionally studied and evaluated in light of the relatively little experience with this modality of treatment for bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis. Prevention of recurrence].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the main cause of vaginitis. The condition is characterised by an abundant and odorous vaginal loss, but more than half the patients with demonstrable signs of BV do not report symptoms at all. Gardnerella vaginalis (Gv) is often associated with BV, but it is not the sole factor responsible, as is shown by the fact that it can be isolated in the vagina of women withBV. In 1992 and 1993, 2630 patients, 1460 of them gynaecological and 1170 obstetric, were admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic of Parma University. Amsel criteria were adopted for diagnosing BV. Cases of BV were treated with 5 mg/die 2% clindamycin vaginal cream for 7 days. In the event of recurrences, 250 mg tablets of metronidazol were added: 8 tablets in 4 administrations in a single day, treatment also being extended to the partner. Patients admitted in 1993 received a protocol of hygienic and behavioural standards, stress being laid on prophylaxisa measures even after the end of therapy. BV proved to be present in 12.3% of cases, of whom only half were symptomatic. The situation was practically stationary if the 2 years are considered separately. Recurrences of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis were 15% in the absence of protocol application and 8.3% after the protocol. Recurrences were less frequent in the asymptomatic forms. Compared to the total number od cases of BV, recurrences were significantly low (12.1% p < 0.001).
TI  - A wet smear criterion for bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a simpler criterion for bacterial vaginosis than the recommended criterion of Amsel. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study comparing diagnostic data with a recommended standard. SETTING: Danish general practice. PARTICIPANTS: 595 non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years who were gynaecologically examined, were divided into two groups in accordance with a complaint of vaginal discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The associations of pH > 4.5, homogeneity, amine odour, clue cells, and wet smear assessment of predominance of lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis, motile rods with the criterion of Amsel. RESULTS: The four components of Amsel showed a considerable variation of association. Predominance of GV was more highly associated than several of the components. The association of a wet smear criterion composed of the presence of clue cells in combination with predominance of Gardnerella vaginalis and absence of lactobacilli was superior to other combinations. In the group without a complaint of vaginal discharge, preceding screening with use of a pH-measurement seemed advantageous. CONCLUSION: The wet smear criterion seems suitable for use in general practice. But before a definitive establishment, calculation of the reproducibility of interpretation of this criterion, preferably with a more explicit setting of the components, has to be carried out.
TI  - A longitudinal study of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the longitudinal changes in the incidence of vaginosis in pregnancy. DESIGN: A prospective study of women during pregnancy. SETTING: A District General Hospital in North-West London. SUBJECTS: Seven hundred and eighteen pregnant women attending antenatal clinics. At their first attendance and subsequently, Gram-stained vaginal smears were examined and Mycoplasma hominis and Gardnerella vaginalis were sought by culture. RESULTS: Initially, 87 (12%) women had bacterial vaginosis diagnosed on Gram-stained reading of the vaginal smears. Examination of further smears, obtained from 176 women at 36 weeks of gestation, showed that those whose vaginal flora was normal initially, and who went to term, rarely developed vaginosis (three of 127, 2.4%). Samples were obtained at 36 weeks gestation from 32 women who had bacterial vaginosis initially, and went to term. In almost 50% (15 of 32) of these a normal lactobacillus-dominated flora had regenerated. Thirty-five women (5%) had initial vaginal smears graded as intermediate. From this group, six of the 17 (35%) women from whom samples were obtained at 36 weeks gestation still had flora of an intermediate pattern; 10(59%) now had normal flora and only one (6%) had developed bacterial vaginosis. Women with bacterial vaginosis were more likely to be culture-positive for M. hominis than those with normal flora (34/78 versus 10/563, odds ratio 42.73 (18.9 to 102.3) P < 0.001), or to be culture-positive for G. vaginalis than those with normal flora (35/78 versus 21/563, odds ratio 21.0 (10.75 to 41.2) P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women do not commonly develop bacterial vaginosis after 16 weeks gestation, and if present, it remits spontaneously in approximately half of those who reach term. As bacterial vaginosis is associated with increased rates of second trimester miscarriage and preterm delivery, any treatment aimed at its eradication in pregnancy should be given no later than the beginning of the second trimester of pregnancy.
TI  - Studies on the anaerobic (bacterial) vaginosis among the Bangladeshi women of reproductive age group.
AB  - Vaginal swab from 190 patients aged between 15 to 45 years with the complaint of  excessive and foul smelling vaginal discharge and 50 healthy controls of comparable age were studied. Different diagnostic techniques used for the detection of G.vaginalis were compared. Antibiogram of isolated G.vaginalis was also performed to determine the drug sensitivity pattern. G. vaginalis were isolated from 74 patients (38.9%) and from 6 controls (12%). The rate of isolation of G. vaginalis in the vaginal swabs of patients is significantly higher (p < 0.001) as compared to controls. Vaginal flora in 91% of G. vaginalis positive patients were Gardnerella morphotype and clue cells were found in vaginal discharge in 85% of these cases. In contrast, vaginal flora of 92% control group were Lactobacilli morphotype N and no clue cell was detected. No pus cell was observed in the vaginal discharge of 66 (89.2%) of 74 patients infected with G. vaginalis. Amine test was positive in 81% G. vaginalis positive patients. The test was negative in all the control cases. Significance of these findings were discussed in detail.
TI  - Lea's Shield, a new barrier contraceptive preliminary clinical evaluations three-day tolerance study.
AB  - In this study the Lea's Shield was evaluated for its tolerance by women who wore  the device for three consecutive days. Ten women who wore the Lea's Shield for 72 hours completed the tolerance study without adverse effects. Examination of the cervix and vagina revealed that the device did not provoke any significant cellular or microbial changes among the wearers. No major changes in the appearance or prevalence of vaginal flora occurred in the women after three days of wearing the device. A gradient in the pH could be detected between the contents of the vagina, which was more acidic than the contents of the bowl of the device. The range of cervical shapes and vaginal morphology among the study participants has had no influence upon the ability of the device to remain in its proper position. The device "settles in place" as it is pushed in, thereby obviating any special maneuvers for proper positioning. No vaginal nor cervical trauma occurred. We have concluded from these basic clinical evaluations that Lea's Shield is well tolerated during three days of use. Efficacy trials in women at risk recently completed have confirmed the high degree of acceptability and that the device can function adequately as one size fits all.
TI  - Evaluation of the Etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  - One hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 Gardnerella vaginalis, 16 Mobiluncus spp., 19 Peptostreptococcus spp., 20 Lactobacillus spp., 20 Prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 Bacteroides fragilis group, 12 Clostridium spp., and five Fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and a reference (Brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. For the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the Etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of Mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for Peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). The quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. Results with B. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower Etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. The absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between Etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. The Etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis: transport, microscopy, testing resistance].
AB  - G. vaginalis is an important pathogen in the aetiology of bacterial vaginosis. Therefore, we investigated the influence of transport systems in isolation, a scoring system for Gram stains, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. The comparison between a simple (Transwab) and a sophisticated (Port-A-Cul) system showed no differences with regard to for instance Enterococcus faecalis or Escherichia coli; however, isolation of G. vaginalis, a fastidious microorganism, was significantly higher (alpha < 0.0001) in Port-A-Cul. There was a strong correlation (97.5%) using the scoring system indicating bacterial vaginosis and isolation of G. vaginalis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of metronidazole for 60 strains of G. vaginalis were higher than 32 mg/l, some strains showing heteroresistance. This phenomenon may be an explanation for treatment failures. Clindamycin and erythromycin were much more active, with MIC's between 0.016 and 0.19 mg/l, in-vitro development of resistance being slower for clindamycin than for erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: (I) for isolation of G. vaginalis, a sophisticated transport system is mandatory; (II) a scoring system for Gram staining is helpful in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis; (III) in patients with metronidazole treatment failures, clindamycin should be used.
TI  - Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene patch versus braided polyester tape for the repair of incompetent cervix.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was done to evaluate pregnant patients with cervical incompetence using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) patch versus the commonly used braided polyester tape, comparing the rate of local tissue reaction or onset of contractions, or both. STUDY DESIGN: This study was a prospective clinical trial on 20 patients divided into two groups. Patients having tissue reactions or contractions were identified and each material was analyzed using a new approach by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and roentgenogram diffraction studies. RESULTS: In the group of pregnant patients sutured with polyester tape there were four failures because of infection and contractions. There were no direct or indirect complications encountered in the ePTFE group. Bacteriologic evaluations of the failures revealed Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides species, and Trichomonas vaginalis in various combinations, in addition to crystal structure degradation and layers of phagocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a rationale for understanding the differences in morphologic integrity and the superiority of the ePTFE patch over the polyester tape using a new analytic approach of SEM and roentgenographic diffraction studies. Because of the small number of patients and because the procedure was performed in a select patient population, we recommend that further trials be undertaken with a larger number of patients in more advanced gestational age and in patients presenting with emergent cervical incompetence.
TI  - Effects of Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus curtisii, and Lactobacillus acidophilus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A decreased concentration or total disappearance of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. GOAL OF THE STUDY: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (VEC). STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial strains 14C- and or 3H-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in VECs before and after treatment at sub-MIC with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. RESULTS: In control tests of adherence, G. vaginalis and M. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at pH 5.4, L. acidophilus at pH 4.4. Preincubation of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/mL (subinhibitory concentration) at pH 5.4 reduced adherence to VECs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. The same treatment of L. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. Treatment of VECs alone did not modify adherence. Competition tests between L. acidophilus and G. vaginalis and between L. acidophilus and M. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, L. acidophilus could compete with G. vaginalis and M. curtisii for binding sites in VECs at pH 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. At a higher pH (4.8 and 5.4), L. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii. CONCLUSIONS: Cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of G. vaginalis and M. curtisii to VECs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. Adhesion of L. acidophilus to VECs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at pH 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. At higher pH levels, L. acidophilus did not compete for binding sites occupied by G. vaginalis and M. curtisii.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis in a district genitourinary medicine department: significance of vaginal microbiology and anaerobes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to correlate the significance of vaginal microbiology,  in particular its anaerobic component, to the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV), and to review the clinical criteria used in the diagnosis of this condition. Ninety-two female patients who received routine STD screening were studied. After routine history, presence and character of vaginal discharge and vaginal pH were noted, an amine test performed, and a wet stain observed microscopically. Routine Gram stain smears and cultures were prepared. BV was diagnosed clinically in 28 (30%) of our sample, and Gardnerella vaginalis was cultured in 41 patients (45%). Both clue cells and anaerobes were closely associated with each other and both mutually exclusive with the presence of lactobacilli on Gram stain (P < 0.001). BV was found to be strongly associated with the presence of clue cells on the wet film, anaerobes and G. vaginalis. In conclusion, bacterial vaginosis is not only strongly associated with the presence of G. vaginalis in the vaginal flora, but more strongly with the presence of anaerobes. The study suggests that the microaerophile G. vaginalis is a commensal organism in a significant proportion of sexually active women. If the aerobic status of the healthy vagina is disrupted, anaerobes (including Gardnerella) will flourish, producing the clinical picture of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Sexually transmitted diseases.
AB  
TI  - Transhymenal cultures for sexually transmissible organisms.
AB  - Vaginal swabs were examined for sexually transmissible organisms in 238 girls seen over a 36 month period from July 1989 to June 1992 inclusive. Three groups were seen (age range 1.5-16.1 years), 165 in group 1 in whom there had been a disclosure of sexual abuse, 35 in group 2 where there was a strong suspicion of sexual abuse, and 38 with vulvovaginitis who formed group 3. The isolation of recognised sexually transmitted organisms was low; however, of group 1 19% were colonised with Gardnerella vaginalis compared with 3% of group 2 and 3% of group 3. These figures show significant differences in the proportion of children in each group isolating only from children over the age of 8 years and in five of the six girls with Candida spp there was concern about sexual abuse. Vulvovaginitis in young children was not associated with vaginal candidiasis. The relation of findings to age is discussed and recommendations are made for testing procedures.
TI  - Patient education. Diagnosis and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This paper continues our series looking at some of the information patients may require with regard to common health problems. Providing information that is comprehensible is an important part of the nurse's role. It is vital that information, usually provided for particular specialties, is made available to all health-care workers and patients.
TI  - Changes in vaginal flora during pregnancy and association with preterm birth.
AB  - A prospective study of the vaginal flora changes between midtrimester and labor was undertaken in 560 women; 337 had intact membranes and were in labor when swabs were taken. Of these, 45 delivered preterm. Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum (both associated with preterm birth when present in midtrimester), and Mycoplasma hominis commonly persisted between midtrimester and labor, particularly in the preterm cohort (24 [65%] of 37 midtrimester isolates), and these organisms were seldom acquired late in pregnancy. A second group, Bacteroides species, had both a high persistence (9 [60%] of 15 midtrimester isolates) and high late acquisition rate (10 [53%] of 19 labor isolates) in the preterm cohort. These findings provide a rationale for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. A third group, comprising enteropharyngeal bacteria and Peptostreptococcus species, were almost all acquired late in the preterm cohort (14 [88%] of 16 labor isolates), and persistence from midtrimester was rare.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and efficacy of short-course oral metronidazole  treatment: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the natural history of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and to assess the efficacy of short courses of oral metronidazole therapy for long-term suppression of bacterial vaginosis flora. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two 2-day courses of metronidazole (400 mg twice daily) in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis (by Gram stain) and/or heavy growth of Gardnerella vaginalis. The first course was given at 24 weeks' gestation and a second course at 29 weeks if the follow-up vaginal swab grew G vaginalis. Follow-up swabs were performed at 28, 32, and 36 weeks' gestation. RESULTS: On the basis of their G vaginalis colonization, 196 women were enrolled, and 137 were evaluable for efficacy, including 66 with bacterial vaginosis. The microbial ecology of bacterial vaginosis in 36 women in the placebo group was relatively stable, with 72% persistence at 28 weeks and 57% at 32 weeks' gestation. Metronidazole effectively suppressed bacterial vaginosis for 4 weeks after the first course in 76%, compared with 28% in the placebo group, and had a cumulative efficacy of 87% compared to 44% 4 weeks after the second course (odds ratio 0.12, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.5). CONCLUSIONS: The microbial ecology of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women is relatively stable. Long-term suppression of bacterial vaginosis flora for 2-3 months can be achieved by short courses of metronidazole therapy in 87% of women in mid-pregnancy. Because bacterial vaginosis has been associated with an increased risk of preterm labor, these findings provide the foundation for an intervention study of women with bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.
TI  - [Vulvo-cervico-vaginal inflammatory pathologies in childhood and adolescence. Our experience].
AB  - One hundred and twenty-seven pediatric and adolescent patients suffering from vulvo-vaginitis underwent clinical and instrumental tests. The results of bacterioscopic and cultural test were negative in 39 (31.7%) patients due to the probable intervention of local hormonal, allergic and/or irritative factors. The tests used by the authors revealed phlogosis in 88 patients (68.3%) which was aspecific in 58 cases (65.9%) and specific in 30 (34.1%). While aspecific phlogosis were basically caused by germs of intestinal origin, typical of childhood and the prepuberal period, mycetes, gardnerella vaginalis, protozoa and chlamydia trachomatis were identified as the causes, in order of importance, of specific phlogosis, the exclusive hallmarks of adolescence.
TI  - Study on treatment of bacterial vaginosis with oral administration of metronidazole or cefdinir.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is considered to be one of the most common vaginal infections in women. Fifteen symptomatic women with BV were enrolled in this study. Ten patients with the diagnosis of BV were treated with 10 days oral administration of metronidazole (MTN), 500 mg twice a day, and five patients with cefdinir (CFDN), 300 mg three times a day. In the MTN therapy, the rate of abnormal vaginal discharge subjectively decreased from 100 to 60%, the rate of abnormal vaginal discharges objectively decreased from 100 to 20%, the rate of positive amine tests decreased from 100 to 20%, the rate of genital malodor and abnormal pH of vaginal discharges decreased substantially from 100 to 10%, and the rate of the presence of clue cells also decreased notably from 90 to 10%. However, in the CFDN therapy, none of these factors improved. With respect to susceptibility to CFDN and MTN, CFDN demonstrated good antibacterial activity against almost all bacteria isolated except Gardnerella vaginalis. On the other hand, MTN demonstrated excellent activity against anaerobic bacteria except Peptostreptococcus spp., and had no antibacterial activity against aerobic bacteria. Since the therapeutic effect of MTN in BV appeared to be better than that of CFDN, anaerobes may play a major role in causing clinical symptoms in patients with BV.
TI  - Prevalence of vaginitis, syphilis and HIV infection in women in the Orange Free State.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of vaginitis, syphilis and HIV infection in women in the Orange Free State. METHOD: By cluster sampling, 120 rural (farm) and 120 urban (local authority) clusters, each containing 4 women, were selected. Women aged 18-49 years who were included in the study had a cervical smear taken for cytological evaluation and blood specimens drawn for syphilis and HIV testing; they were questioned on their knowledge of AIDS. RESULTS: Trichomonas vaginalis vaginitis was present in 27.4% of the rural women and 29.6% of the urban women, Gardnerella vaginalis in 7.2% and 8.4% and Candida spp. in 2.6% and 6.7% respectively. Syphilis serology was positive in 12% of rural and 16% of urban women. HIV was present in 0.4% of rural and 1.5% of urban women. Ninety per cent of urban women and 74% of rural women knew AIDS was a sexually transmitted disease. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalences of trichomonas vaginitis and syphilis were unusually high, while HIV positivity was similar to that in other reports in South Africa.
TI  - Genital flora in pregnancy and its association with intrauterine growth retardation.
AB  - A study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was conducted  among a cohort of 13,914 pregnant women enrolled in the multicenter Vaginal Infections and Prematurity Study. From 23 through 26 weeks of gestational age, cultures of specimens from the vagina and cervix were done for group B streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Prevotella. Newborns who were small for their gestational age were delivered by 1,251 women, and infants of the appropriate weight for their gestational age were delivered by 10,332 women. When controlling for ethnicity and smoking and excluding women treated with antibiotics, the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted relative risk of IUGR was 1.16 for Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas spp. (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.33), 1.16 for M. hominis (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.29), 1.20 for U. urealyticum (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.38), and 1.22 for T. vaginalis (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.42). There was also a strong and significant trend for an increasing risk of IUGR with the number of these four microbes recovered. Among women colonized with all four isolates, the adjusted odds ratio of IUGR was 1.79 (95% CI, 1.27 to 2.52) in comparison with women not colonized with any of these microorganisms. Group B streptococci, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and C. albicans were not significantly associated with IUGR. These results suggest that infection is associated with some cases of IUGR and that specific microorganisms, alone or in combination, are involved. Since genital isolates are highly correlated with each other, the relative contribution of each microbe is difficult to determine.

TI  - Evaluation of API Coryne system for identifying coryneform bacteria.
AB  - AIM: To identify rapidly and accurately coryneform bacteria, using a commercial strip system. METHODS: Ninety eight strains of Corynebacterium species and 62 additional strains belonging to genera Erysipelothrix, Oerskovia, Rhodococcus, Actinomyces, Archanobacterium, Gardnerella and Listeria were studied. Bacteria were identified using conventional biochemical tests and a commercial system (API-Coryne, BioMerieux, France). Fresh rabbit serum was added to fermentation tubes for Gardnerella vaginalis isolates. RESULTS: One hundred and five out of the 160 (65.7%) organisms studied were correctly and completely identified by the API Coryne system. Thirty five (21.8%) more were correctly identified with additional tests. Seventeen (10.6%) organisms were not identified by the system and three (1.9%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The system was a good alternative for identification of coryneform organisms. When occasionally performed with some additional tests, this method permits reliable and rapid identification of coryneform organisms compared with conventional methods.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis as urinary pathogen].
AB  - AIM: To study the significance of Gardnerella vaginalis in urine by comparing urine culture results, leucocytes count and clinical findings. METHODS: A total of 1,365 urine specimens submitted consecutively were inoculated on Bilayer media. G. vaginalis was recovered from 76 urine specimens with the following distribution: in 12 samples G. vaginalis was isolated as the only organism, 9 with counts > 10(5) CFU/ml and 3 between 10(5)-10(3); in the remaining 64 samples G. vaginalis was always found in counts > 10(5) CFU/ml but associated in 13 occasions with another organism and in 51 occasions with 2 or more organisms from the periurethral and vaginal flora. RESULTS: G. vaginalis in pure cultures corresponded to 8 women and 4 males whose ages ranged from 20 to 86 years. Six patients complained of symptoms of lower urinary tract infection (UTI), 3 had fever and in 3 the urine culture was practised as a control. Seven patients presented predisposing factors to UTI and 2 were pregnant. In only 2 cases pyuria was detected. Of 12 patients with pure cultures, only 3 were found to have G. vaginalis UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that G. vaginalis in urine not always implies an UTI and that this organism is found most often in patients with predisposing factors.
TI  - In vitro adhesiveness of Gardnerella vaginalis strains in relation to the occurrence of clue cells in vaginal discharge.
AB  - G. vaginalis was isolated from 52.4 per cent patients with non-specific vaginitis. The haemagglutinating activity of G. vaginalis was strongest with human 'O' red cells and weaker reactions were observed with sheep and chick erythrocytes. Haemagglutinating activity of G. vaginalis with human 'O' cells (1:16 titre) could be correlated with clue cells in vaginal discharge in 73 per cent patients while in lower titres, this correlation was not observed.
TI  - Carriage of Gardnerella vaginalis in the urethra of Indian men.
AB  - A total of 310 consecutive sexually active men attending sexually transmitted disease clinic of the Nehru Hospital, Chandigarh, were studied to assess the prevalence of G vaginalis. Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) was diagnosed in 53, acute gonococcal urethritis (AGU) in 20, psychosomatic disorders in 50 and genital ulcer disease in 187 patients. G. vaginalis was isolated in 11 patients (3.5%) only. Of these 11 isolates, 4(7.5%) were from patients with NGU, 2(10.0%) from men diagnosed to have AGU, 3(6%) from the patients with psychosomatic disorders and 2 isolates (1.7%) from patients with genital ulcer disease.
TI  - Variability of polymerase chain reaction-based detection of human papillomavirus  DNA is associated with the composition of vaginal microbial flora.
AB  - The results of repeated human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing were compared to changes in cervical pathology and the composition of vaginal microorganisms. A cohort of 19 women with HPV cervical infections in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia at enrollment was reexamined on average at 7.3-month intervals over a 2-year period. At each follow-up visit, cytological and colposcopic examinations were done and vaginal microorganisms were assessed quantitatively by Gram staining of secretions, and anaerobic and aerobic culture. HPV genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 were detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis using DNA isolated from exfoliated cervical cells. The detection of HPV DNA was significantly associated with carriage of Grade II flora (P < 0.001), isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis (P = 0.03), Ureaplasma urealyticum (P = 0.04), Candida albicans (P = 0.01), Bacteroides species (P = 0.01), and overgrowth by anaerobes (P = 0.004). Normal vaginal flora, characterised by the predominance of Lactobacillus species, was significantly associated (P < 0.001) with a negative HPV test. The detection of HPV DNA is associated with the composition of microorganisms present in the vagina at the time of testing.

TI  - Microbiological patterns in vaginitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and microbial aetiology of vaginitis, and  the usefulness of Gram staining of vaginal fluid in detecting the aetiology of vaginitis in Sri Lankan women. DESIGN: Prospective study with microbiological investigation of high vaginal specimens from symptomatic and healthy groups of women. SETTING: A gynaecological clinic of the De Soysa Hospital for Women, and a family planning clinic of the Family Health Bureau, Colombo. PATIENTS: 114 untreated patients with symptoms suggestive of vaginitis and 109 healthy controls. RESULTS: Candida species were isolated from 36% patients and 9% of controls. Gardnerella vaginalis was recovered from 8.8% of patients and 7.3% of controls. The bacterial vaginitis group consisted of several distinct subgroups, viz Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis, anaerobic vaginitis, non-anaerobic vaginitis and polymicrobial vaginitis. The incidence of trichomoniasis was lower (4.4%) compared to other studies. Other bacteria (anaerobes, enterococci, coliforms, Group B Streptococci) were isolated in significantly higher numbers in the symptomatic group compared to the control group. Microscopy showed that the majority (73%) of the Candida vaginitis patients retained the normal Lactobacillus morphotype. In bacterial vaginitis Lactobacillus morphotype was replaced by other bacterial morphotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In our study 36% had candidiasis, 4.4% had trichomoniasis and 47% had bacterial vaginitis. In 12% there was no detectable pathogen. Microscopy of vaginal fluid is useful in determining the aetiology of vaginitis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - [Urethro-adnexitis in the man and acute urethral syndrome in the woman. Microbiological and immunologic studies of etiologic classification].
AB  - Both common pathogens and unconventional, fastidious bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi are causative agents in male urethro-adnexitis and in female acute urethral syndrome. Uropathogens, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma spp., Haemophilus ducreyi, Calymmatobacterium granulomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, Herpes simplex virus type II (HSV II), papillomaviruses (HPV), Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida spp. must be considered. The various diagnostic procedures and criteria applied for aetiological classification in cases of balanitis, urethritis, prostatitis, epididymitis, orchitis, and acute urethral syndrome are reviewed and evaluated.
TI  - [Value of the score for Gram strains in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - The interpretation of Gram-stained slides of vaginal swab specimens is evaluated  for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and correlated with the isolation bacteria and clinical signs: thin homogeneous vaginal discharge, pH > or = 4.7, amine odor and presence of clue cells. Gram stained smears were scored following a morphotype classification: (a)-Lactobacillus morphotypes (scored 4 to 0), (b)-small Gram negative (G. vaginalis, scored 0 to 4), (c)-curved Gram variable rods (Mobiluncus morphotypes, scored 0 to 2). The scoring system (0 to 10) was a weighted combination of these morphotypes: a+b+c. The criterion for bacterial vaginosis was a score > or = 7, a score of 0 to 6 was considered as no bacterial vaginosis. Samples of 709 women, aged 18 to 84 (mean age = 39.7) were examined. The prevalence of G. vaginalis culture was 12.5%, and Mobiluncus infection occurred in 1.5%. The frequency of M. hominis was diagnosed in 2.8% of women. A score of 7 to 10 on Gram stain was observed in 9.7% in the population. Compared to G. vaginalis culture, Gram stained smear was more sensitive (0.71) than clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis (0.46). The specificity was similar with the two methods. The assessment of G. vaginalis morphotypes was highly correlated with the G. vaginalis culture (p < 0.001, OR = 248). The infection of T. vaginalis or Candida sp. was never associated with a score > or = 7. The Gram-stained smear is a cheap, fast and easy method. It provides good results for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis is associated with prematurity and vaginal fluid mucinase and sialidase: results of a controlled trial of topical clindamycin cream.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes linked with reproductive tract infection remains poorly understood. Mucolytic enzymes, including mucinases and sialidases (neuraminidase), are recognized virulence factors among enteropathogens and bacteria that cause periodontal infection. Perturbation of maternal cervicovaginal mucosa membrane host defenses by such enzyme-producing microorganisms may increase the risk of subclinical intrauterine infection during pregnancy and thus increase risks of preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated vaginal fluid mucinase and sialidase and selected cervicovaginal bacteria along with pregnancy outcomes in 271 women. Within this study, women with bacterial vaginosis (16 to 27 week' gestation) were treated with 2% clinadmycin vaginal cream or placebo. Enzyme, microbial findings, treatment effects, and pregnancy outcomes were compared among drug- and placebo-treated women and control women without bacterial vaginosis. RESULTS: Presence of bacterial vaginosis at intake was associated with increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 9.1, p = 0.02), premature rupture of membranes (relative risk 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 9.0, p = 0.002), and preterm premature rupture of membranes. Mucinase and sialidase activities were more commonly identified, and they occurred in higher concentrations, if present, in women with bacterial vaginosis (mucinase: 44.3% with bacterial vaginosis vs 27.4% without, p = 0.007; sialidase: 45% with bacterial vaginosis vs 12% without p < 0.001). Sialidase activity was associated with bacterial vaginosis-linked organisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp, and Mycoplasma hominis) and Chlamydia trachomatis and yeast species; mucinase activity was associated only with bacterial vaginosis-linked microorganisms. Clindamycin, 2% cream, was effective treatment for bacterial vaginosis and temporarily reduced mucinase and sialidase activities. Topical treatment of bacterial vaginosis did not reduce risks of perinatal morbidity. Women with persistent or recurrent sialidase 8 weeks after treatment were at increased risk of preterm birth (15.6% vs 7.4%) premature rupture of membranes (30% vs 15%), and low birth weight (20% vs 3%, relative risk 6.8, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 28.1). CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of sialidase-producing vaginal microorganisms in numbers sufficient to increase vaginal fluid sialidase activity may be a risk factor for possibly preventable subclinical intrauterine infection and preterm birth. This study confirms and further informs our understanding of the association of bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth; studies to evaluate whether systemic treatment for bacterial vaginosis can effectively reduce vaginal mucolytic enzymes and risks of prematurity and other morbid outcomes are continuing.
TI  - Cytopathologic changes associated with intrauterine contraceptive devices. A review of cervico-vaginal smears in 350 women.
AB  - Cervico-vaginal smears from 350 IUCD users were analysed to ascertain the range of abnormalities induced in the genital tract of these women. Alteration of the microbial environment, inflammatory, degenerative, reparative and proplastic epithelial changes were the salient cytological findings. The clinical implications of these are briefly discussed.
TI  - [The use of eubiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - The study was concerned with the problem of the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. To correct the dysbiotic condition in the vagina, a two-stage procedure was applied. The first stage was aimed at the provision of the normal physiological condition of the vaginal medium and mucosa and the second stage was aimed at the provision of the normal microbiocenosis. At the second stage biological preparations such as lactobacterin, acylact, bifidumbacterin and bifidin were used. The recovery was stated in 88.4 per cent of the cases after a single treatment course with the use of the biological preparations. In 4.7 and 2.1 per cent of the cases the recovery was stated after two and three treatment courses respectively. In 4.7 per cent of the cases the treatment was of low efficacy. The use of the eubiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis was shown to be highly efficient.
TI  - PCR primers and probes for the 16S rRNA gene of most species of pathogenic bacteria, including bacteria found in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A set of broad-range PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria were tested, along with three series of oligonucleotide probes to detect the PCR product. The first series of probes is broad in range and consists of a universal bacterial probe, a gram-positive probe, a Bacteroides-Flavobacterium probe, and two probes for other gram-negative species. The second series was designed to detect PCR products from seven major bacterial species or groups frequently causing meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The third series was designed for the detection of DNA from species or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The primers amplified DNA from all 124 different species of bacteria tested. Southern hybridization testing of the broad-range probes with washes containing 3 M tetramethylammonium chloride indicated that this set of probes correctly identified all but two of the 102 bacterial species tested, the exceptions being Deinococcus radiopugnans and Gardnerella vaginalis. The gram-negative and gram-positive probes hybridized to isolates of two newly characterized bacteria, Alloiococcus otitis and Rochalimaea henselii, as predicted by Gram stain characteristics. The CSF pathogen and contaminant probe sequences were compared with available sequence information and with sequencing data for 32 different species. Testing of the CSF pathogen and contaminant probes against DNA from over 60 different strains indicated that, with the exception of the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus probes, these probes provided the correct identification of bacterial species known to be found in CSF.
TI  - Virulence attributes of low-virulence organisms.
AB  - The vast majority of infections involving female pelvic structures arise from organisms that are members of the normal flora. In addition, exogenous organisms that invade through the lower genital tract must interact with organisms that are part of the host's flora. In contrast to the concept that the normal flora is entirely innocuous, recent research has begun to identify what appear to be virulence attributes among these ordinarily low-virulence organisms. Most of our understanding of virulence has been derived from highly virulent organisms, of which Neisseria gonorrhoeae provides an example of relevance to the female genital tract. A review of the virulence factors of the gonococcus is presented to serve as an example of the variety of virulence properties associated with pathogenic bacteria. Molecular biology has begun to clarify one of the important paradigms of pathogenic bacteriology-that bacteria change their expression of virulence properties in response to their location within a host or to the stage of infection. Thus, infection involves not only the possession of virulence factors, but also the carefully controlled use of those factors. Virulence is often controlled by the coordinate expression of many virulence-associated genes in response to one environmental signal. With regard to low- virulence organisms present in the female lower genital tract, we are beginning to identify some of their virulence attributes. Examples from the work of our laboratory include the hemolysin of Gardnerella vaginalis and an immunosuppressive mycotoxin produced by Candida albicans. Demonstrating the coordinate expression (or other control mechanisms) of virulence factors in these sometimes innocuous and sometimes inimical organisms represents the next frontier in the study of normal vaginal microbiology.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  - The vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. Demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. BV, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (P < 0.01). The condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. BV was associated with low birth weight. Of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with BV were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (P < 0.0005). The presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative Lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and BV. BV-associated microorganisms, i.e., Mobiluncus, Prevotella, and Peptostreptococcus species, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with BV (P = 0.0001 for each comparison). Mobiluncus curtisii and Fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. Our study clearly indicates that BV and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.
TI  - Evaluation of affirm VP Microbial Identification Test for Gardnerella vaginalis and Trichomonas vaginalis.
AB  - A commercial system (Affirm VP Microbial Identification Test; MicroProbe Corp.) for detection of vaginal pathogens was evaluated with 176 consecutive women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic for genital complaints. Vaginal swab specimens were used for culture of Gardnerella vaginalis and Trichomonas vaginalis, preparation of a vaginal smear for Gram stain interpretation, and wet mount evaluation. An additional swab was used to evaluate the 30-min nonisotopic oligonucleotide probe test. The automated probe system detected G. vaginalis in 69 (95%) of 73 women having > 5 x 10(5) CFU of G. vaginalis per ml by culture, and 20 (43%) of 47 specimens with < or = 5 x 10(5) CFU of G. vaginalis per ml. There were three false positives and four false negatives for the Affirm VP test compared with > 5 x 10(5) CFU of G. vaginalis per ml. The probe system detected G. vaginalis in 57 (90%) of 63 vaginal specimens from women having clue cells on wet mount examination, and in only 3 (3%) of 113 women without clue cells, suggesting that the Affirm probe for G. vaginalis could be used as a surrogate for wet mount examination for clue cells. The T. vaginalis probe was positive for 12 of 12 specimens positive by wet mount and 12 of 15 specimens positive by culture. There were no false positives and three false negatives for the Affirm VP test compared with culture and/or wet mount for T. vaginalis. The Affirm VP Microbial Identification System is a rapid, objective, and automated test for the detection of T. vaginalis and clinically significant levels of G. vaginalis that is comparable to wet mount examination for clue cells and is superior to wet mount examination for the detection of trichomonads.
TI  - Bacteremia due to Gardnerella vaginalis: report of two cases.
AB  
TI  - [Biocenosis of the vagina and infection with Chlamydia trachomatis].
AB  - The authors have examined 379 women for infection by Chlamydia trachomatis, performing vaginal smears and routine bacterial cultures. C. trachomatis was discovered in 33.2% of the women, most frequently accompanied by erosion of the collum, cervicitis and CIN-Ca. Women with C. trachomatis had the following levels of vaginal purity: 1-44.4%, 2-23.0%, 3 and 4-29.4%, 3.2% -leukocytes only. Leukocytes were present in significantly more women with level 1 of vaginal purity than in the control group. Additional infections (Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli and Trichomonas vaginalis) were found in only a small percentage of women with C. trachomatis, just as in controls. The presence of leukocytes or level 1 of vaginal hygiene with leukocytes may favour C. trachomatis, just as in controls. The presence of leukocytes or level 1 of vaginal hygiene with leukocytes may favour C. trachomatis infection, therefore these cases should be subjected to a more thorough examination.
TI  - [Genital microbial flora in a population of high obstetrical risk].
AB  - There is increasing evidence showing the association between maternal genital infection, prematurity and neonatal or maternal morbidity. To know the genital flora of women attending a high risk pregnancy service, 73 consecutive pregnant women attending the high risk pregnancy service at the Hospital San Borja-Arriaran from may to august 1992 were included in this study, 75.3% of the vaginal discharges corresponded to fluids of normal appearance and 24.7% were altered. The microorganisms most frequently isolates were lactobacilli, U. urealitycum and coagulase negative strains of Staphylococcus. The Gram stain revealed the existence of bacterial vaginosis in 20.9% of the vaginal smears. There was a significant higher incidence of lactobacilli in patients with balanced healthy vaginal flora, whereas Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis were isolated significantly more frequently from women with bacterial vaginosis. With the exception of genital mycoplasma, it was found a low incidence of sex transmitted bacteria in this study.
TI  - [Perinatal infections. Infection as etiological factor of preterm labor].
AB  - On the ground of contemporary medical literature and our own observations, we have tried to estimate the participation of microorganism infection in preterm labor. In this article, we present mechanism, currently recognized as the most probable, that are leading to preterm labor under condition of perinatal infections. One of them seems to be the production of enzymes by pathological strains. Those enzymes are considered to stimulate decidual and amniotic cells to arachidonic acid metabolism and prostaglandins synthesis. Coexisted with chorionamnionitis the migration of leukocytes that are able to induce prostaglandins synthesis releasing interleukin, can also be an important factor of preterm labor.
TI  - Determination of Gardnerella vaginalis genome size by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The chromosomal DNA of four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were digested with rare cutting restriction enzymes and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The four strains studied were two clinical isolates (GVP 004 & GVP 007) and two American Type Culture Collection strains (ATCC 14018 & ATCC 14019). The restriction enzyme SfiI generated two DNA fragments of about 0.6 Mb and 1.1 Mb in all four strains giving a G. vaginalis genome size of about 1.7 Mb. A similar genome size was calculated utilizing two more GC-rich sequence specific restriction endonucleases, NotI and AscI. When digested with AscI, the chromosomal DNA of all four strains gave rise to 11 to 12 DNA fragments ranging between 0.01 Mb to 0.43 Mb. DNA from the two clinical isolates were digested by NotI (yielding 7 to 9 fragments), while the DNA from the two ATCC strains were resistant to NotI digestion. In contrast the clinical isolates, DNA from the two ATCC strains gave an identical profile for all restriction endonucleases tested. From double digestion experiments, the two SfiI sites could be localized on two AscI fragments. From these PFGE studies, it is concluded that the G. vaginalis genome is a circular DNA that ranges between 1.67 Mb and 1.72 Mb in size.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibilities of 93 clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis to 25 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim. Activity was poor for vancomycin, LY146032, the cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem. Some resistance was observed with tetracycline and minocycline. The MICs of metronidazole paralleled those of tinidazole, with the hydroxymetabolite of metronidazole being the most active. One strain was resistant to all three agents. Marked resistance to aztreonam, amikacin, and sulfamethoxazole was observed.
TI  - [A trial of the use of diflucan (fluconazole) in patients with vaginal candidiasis].
AB  - Fifty females with vaginitis due to Candida albicans were treated with fluconazol (diflucan) in a single dose of 150 mg administered per os. A complete elimination of the clinical signs in 42 out of 50 patients (84 per cent) and a significant improvement of the clinical picture in 4 out of 50 patients (8 per cent) were recorded. The cultures of the smears produced no fungal growth with respect to 31 out of 36 patients (86.1 per cent), while microscopically the presence of the fungus with the signs of pathomorphosis was detected. Such cells could be a source of the fungal reinfection. Therefore, diflucan proved to be a highly efficient drug in the treatment of vaginal candidiasis and might be considered as an additional agent for the therapy of the disease.
TI  - Ionic factors regulating the interaction of Gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin with  red blood cells.
AB  - We have studied the hemolytic properties of an exotoxin released by Gardnerella vaginalis (Gvh). We found that hemolysis induced by Gvh is modulated by the composition of the isotonic buffer in which the red cells are suspended. In particular, low pH enhances its lytic activity, whereas low ionic strength and divalent cations diminish it. The inhibitory effects of reduced salt concentration and divalent cations occur despite normal binding of the toxin to the cells. This suggests that some post-binding step is impaired. The toxin is also able to damage cholesterol-containing lipid vesicles, and even on these model membranes it is more active at low pH. From this point of view, Gvh has some similarity to Clostridium perfringens theta-toxin, a membrane-damaging toxin belonging to the family of 'thiol-activated' cytolysins produced by Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Anaerobic bacteria and gynecologic infections].
AB  - The normal vaginal flora consists of a wide variety of bacteria and the composition of this microflora is influenced by hormonal, metabolic and pharmacological factors. An increased concentration of a mixed anaerobic flora (Mobiluncus, Prevotellae, Peptostreptococci and Gardnerella vaginalis) appears to be an early stage in the development of bacterial vaginosis or in the infection of the upper genital tract. Women with bacterial vaginosis are at increased risk of bartholinitis, skenitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, postpartum and postabortal endometritis, chorioamnionitis and infections following gynecologic surgery or diagnostic procedure.
TI  - Treatment of post-cesarean section endometritis with ampicillin and sulbactam or  clindamycin and gentamicin.
AB  - Seventy-seven patients were prospectively enrolled in a randomized clinical trial to compare two antimicrobial regimens for the treatment of post-cesarean section endometritis. The two groups were not significantly different with respect to age, race, gravidity, parity, hours in labor, cesarean section indication, preoperative or postoperative hemoglobin/hematocrit, pretreatment white blood cell count or pretreatment temperature. Pretreatment urine, blood and endometrial cultures were obtained. One or more organisms was recovered from the endometrium in 90% of the patients using a double-lumen sampling device. The most frequent endometrial isolates were Peptostreptococcus and Bacteroides species, followed by Gardnerella vaginalis and enterococci. Thirty (81%) of 37 patients receiving ampicillin/sulbactam and 33 (83%) of 40 receiving gentamicin and clindamycin responded to therapy. There were 14 (18%) treatment failures, 7 in each group. Five (36%) of the 14 clinical failures were due to septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, 2 (14%) of the 14 failures were complications of intraabdominal abscesses, and the remaining 7 patients responded after a change in their antibiotic regimen. We conclude that ampicillin/sulbactam and clindamycin/gentamicin are similarly effective for the treatment of post-cesarean section endometritis.
TI  - Internal bacterial flora of solid uterine cervical cancer.
AB  - Twenty-five patients with uterine cervical cancer (Two cases stage O; four cases  stage Ia; five cases stage Ib; one case stage IIa; ten cases stage IIb; two cases stage IIIa; one case stage IVa) served as the subjects. The bacterial flora inside the cervical cancers was investigated using the optimal technique. There was mixed abnormal aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in all subjects. The average number of bacterial species isolated from inside the cervical cancers was 6.3. The predominant bacteria isolated were the aerobes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli and Gardnerella vaginalis, and Prevotella bivia. As the stages of cervical cancer progressed, G. vaginalis, B. distasonis and P. bivia were detected at higher rates and higher counts than other bacteria. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between G. vaginalis, B. distasonis and P. bivia and the onset and growth of cervical cancer.
TI  - [Vaginitis and vaginosis. Comparison of two periods].
AB  - Vaginitis is the most frequent gynecological disease. It is characterized by objective and subjective signs of inflammation and differs from bacterial vaginosis (BV) which is an abnormal condition of the vaginal ecosystem caused by the excessive growth of aerobic and anaerobic flora normally present in the vagina with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The authors report the results of a study carried out at the Centre for Gynecological Infections at the Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Parma. 828 patients were enrolled in the study during the period 1985-86 and 1559 patients during the two-year period 1991-92. The aim of the study was to evaluate variations in epidemiological data for vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis in the two periods examined. No significant changes were observed (p > 0.05) with regard to the prevalence of Ca, Tv and BV forms. On the other hand, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the forms sustained by other microorganisms (above all, streptococcus and enterobacteria) between the first and second periods with a parallel increase in the number of negative cases. The analysis of the age distribution of vaginitis and BV showed a reduction of other microorganisms and an increase in negative vaginal swabs in adults (> 20 years old).
TI  - Isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis among women with symptoms of lower genital tract infection.
AB  - Isolation of chlamydia trachomatis from the endocervix using cyclohexamide-treated McCoy cells were done in order to estimate the prevalence rate of its infection among gynecologic out patients who had symptoms and/or signs of lower genital tract infection. There were 498 patients from May 1989 to July 1990. Eighty-six per cent of these patients were 25 years old or older. Most of them (63%) were agricultural employees. Ninety-three per cent were married and 78 per cent had less than or equal to seven yrs of education. Of 476 specimens, isolation rate of C. trachomatis was 7.8 per cent. Other infectious agents isolated by culture were Niesseria gonorrhea 4.8 per cent (24/497), Candida albicans 15.5 per cent (77/498) and Gardnerella vaginalis 6.08 per cent (303/498). Direct microscopy identified 9.4 per cent (32/380) of Trichomonas vaginalis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was able to identify four significant risk factors independently associated with isolation of C. trachomatis. These factors were N. gonorrheal cervicitis (odds ratio = 5.7, 95%, CI = 1.9, 17.0); age less than 25 yrs (odds ratio = 3.3, 95%, CI = 1.5, 7.4); G. vaginalis vaginitis (odds ratio = 3.0, 95%, CI = 1.3, 7.1) and purulent vaginal discharge (odds ratio = 2.5, 95%, CI = 1.5, 5.5).
TI  - Pore-forming and haemolytic properties of the Gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin.
AB  - The pleomorphic bacterium Gardnerella vaginalis releases in the culture broth a haemolytic exotoxin (Gvh) which is probably a virulence determinant of this unique bacterium, implicated in gynaecological and urological disorders. This 59 kDa cytolysin was purified to homogeneity in just one chromatographic step directly from the culture supernatant, a final specific activity up to 1.9 x 10(6) HU mg-1 being obtained. The toxin-induced lesion on human erythrocytes results from the formation of a pore whose radius is approximately 2.4 nm. The damage is inhibited by osmotic protectants and shows a sigmoidal dose-response profile suggesting an aggregation process of haemolysin molecules on the target membrane to create the functional lesion. The extent and the kinetics of haemolysis are strongly dependent on temperature and an activation energy of 64.0 kJ mol-1 has been derived. Lipid membranes can be very efficient inhibitors of Gvh-haemolysis, being able to bind the toxin quite avidly. The inhibitory effect requires the presence of cholesterol and it is stronger when cholesterol is mixed with negatively charged phospholipids rather than with zwitterionic phospholipids, suggesting that a negative surface potential increases the affinity of the toxin for the lipid bilayer. The functional properties of Gvh have been compared with those of Clostridium perfringens thetatoxin (PFO) and Escherichia coli haemolysin (HlyA), which are representative of widespread haemolysins produced by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The toxin shares several features with the family of the so-called 'sulphydryl-activated' cytolysins produced by Gram-positive bacteria, although Gvh does not truly belong to this family, being deactivated by beta-mercaptoethanol and being antigenically distinct from them. We report here for the first time the detection in the vaginal fluid of infected women of a specific IgA response against the toxin.
TI  - Erythromycin versus metronidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Of 101 women, 15-50 years of age, presenting with vaginal discharge, 34 had bacterial vaginosis and were randomly assigned to a seven-day course of oral treatment with either erythromycin (0.5 g b.i.d.) or metronidazole (0.4 g b.i.d.) in a single-blind, cross-over study. Treatment failure (> or = three clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis) occurred in 13 (81%) of 16 patients given erythromycin, as compared with three (17%) of 18 women treated with metronidazole (p < 0.001). Persistence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus species and/or Mycoplasma hominis was found in 14 of 16 patients treated with erythromycin, and in four of 16 patients treated with metronidazole. Treatment with metronidazole was successful (< or = two clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis) in eight of 10 cases of erythromycin treatment failure. Neither of two cases of metronidazole treatment failure was cured with erythromycin. At three-month follow-up of 31 women, persistence or recurrence of bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 11 cases (36%).
TI  - [Quantitative study of vaginal flora during the menstrual cycle].
AB  - The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic vaginal flora of 242 healthy women were examined during menstrual cycles. The most frequently isolated microorganisms at the first premenstrual examination were coagulase-negative staphylococci (61%), followed by enterococci (25%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), diphtheroids (12%), group B streptococci (6.8%), Escherichia coli (5.4%) and Candida spp. (4%). The isolation rate of all species, except Candida and Gardnerella vaginalis increased during menstruation. The lowest isolation rate for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.9% prior to menstruation and it increased to 7.6% during menstruation. This may be of relevance with regard to the toxic shock syndrome. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 37% of women at least once during the study, suggesting, that this species belongs to the normal vaginal flora.
TI  - Chorioamnionitis and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - An improved understanding of bacterial vaginosis and of clinical intraamniotic infection and histologic chorioamnionitis has produced data showing strong associations among these conditions. It has recently been shown that the microorganisms in both bacterial vaginosis and clinical intraamniotic infection are similar, of which anaerobes, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis are the predominant organisms in both. Furthermore, in the amniotic fluid of women with intraamniotic infection, strong associations among anaerobes, G. vaginalis, and M. hominis have recently been observed. In two epidemiologic studies (one in a high-risk group of women in labor and another in a lower risk group of antepartum women), the presence of bacterial vaginosis has been associated with the development of intraamniotic infection. Additional recent studies have provided new evidence that histologic inflammation of the placental membranes is associated with both clinical intraamniotic infection and positive cultures of the placenta. Multiple logistic regression analysis has shown a relationship between isolation of organisms from the chorioamnion and bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Diagnostic microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized microbiologically by replacement of the Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides species, Mobiluncus species, and genital mycoplasmas. A standardized, laboratory-based diagnostic test for bacterial vaginosis is desirable in those instances in which a microscope is unavailable in the clinic or when the evaluator of the wet mount examination is inexperienced at recognizing clue cells. Vaginal cultures have excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, but because the predictive value of a positive G. vaginalis culture is less than 50%, cultures are not recommended. Vaginal Gram smears are objective and reproducible, have 62% to 100% sensitivity, and have a positive predictive value of 76% to 100%. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with use of Papanicolaou-stained smears has been reported, but standardized criteria have not been widely adopted. A rapid, office-based oligonucleotide probe test for high concentrations of G. vaginalis has been developed and may be useful when direct microscopy is unavailable or confidence in microscopic examination is low. Laboratory tests that detect microbial products unique to the vaginal fluid of women with bacterial vaginosis include detection of amines (putrescine, cadaverine, and trimethylamine), measurement of the relative levels of succinate and lactate in the vaginal fluid by gas chromatography, detection of proline aminopeptidase by colorimetric assay, or detection of sialidases in the vaginal fluid. Although these tests are not yet applicable to routine use, these research tests could be adapted for wider use in office laboratories. Vaginal Gram stains are more useful than culture for laboratory confirmation of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - The microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A group of microorganisms are present concurrently in high concentrations in the  vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis. The major members of the group are Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus species, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and often Mobiluncus species. Facultative species of Lactobacillus are present in lower concentrations and are less prevalent in bacterial vaginosis than in women with a normal vaginal examination. The exact microbe(s) responsible for bacterial vaginosis is unknown whether among the organisms listed above or an unknown agent. The high concentrations of anaerobic gram-negative rods, peptostreptococci, and other opportunistic pathogens in the lower genital tract place women with bacterial vaginosis at increased risk for genital infections and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
TI  - [Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis from vaginal discharge specimens].
AB  - In this study specimens taken from 93 patients who admitted to outpatient clinics of SSK Ankara Gynaecology and Obstetrics Hospital with vaginal discharge were examined for G. vaginalis, T. vaginalis, C. albicans and N. gonorrhoeae. We evaluated the smell, pH, direct microscopic examinations, stained preparations and specific culture results of the discharges which were taken from posterior fornix. We isolated G. vaginalis from 13 patients (13.9%), T. vaginalis from 5 patients (5.3%) and C. albicans from 19 patients (20.4%). N. gonorrhoeae could not be isolated from any of the specimens. In our control study, we isolated G. vaginalis in three out of 50 patients (6%) without vaginal discharge. We observed T. vaginalis in specimens of 3 control patients. C. albicans and N. gonorrhoeae could not be isolated in this study in this study.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of tioconazole and its concentrations in vaginal  fluids following topical (vagistat-1 6.5%) application.
AB  - In vitro assays demonstrated that clinical yeasts were significantly more inhibited by tioconazole (MIC50, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) than by fluconazole (MIC50, 8 micrograms/ml). Tioconazole also exhibited high potency against most molds (Alterneria spp. and Acremonium spp.). All Candida tropicalis isolates had MICs of 8 micrograms/ml, four-fold greater than any other Candida spp. Generally Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible to tioconazole. Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml) was the most susceptible Gram-negative species. Staphylococci and enterococci were the most susceptible to tioconazole Gram-positive species (MIC50s, 1-8 micrograms/ml). Bacterial species associated with vaginosis. [Gardnerella vaginalis (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) and Prevotella biviadisiens (MIC90, 64 micrograms/ml)] were inhibited by tioconazole. Isolates of Lactobacillus spp. were most resistant (MIC90, > or = 256 micrograms/ml) to tioconazole. Vaginal fluid levels of tioconazole (mean, 91.4 micrograms/ml) persisted above the MIC90 levels (1-64 micrograms/ml) for most fungal and bacterial pathogens for 72 h in 19 evaluable female human subjects receiving 300 mg tioconazole in an intravaginal ointment.
TI  - Efficacy of intravaginal 0.75% metronidazole gel for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel, formulated  at pH 4.0, for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial. METHODS: Fifty-three women with bacterial vaginosis (clue cells of at least 20% plus vaginal pH of at least 4.7, amine odor, or homogeneous discharge) were enrolled. Women with concomitant infection by Candida, Trichomonas, Chlamydia trachomatis, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae were excluded. Five grams of metronidazole gel or placebo was inserted intravaginally twice daily for 5 days. Response to therapy was evaluated at 4-16 days and 1 month after treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-six of the 30 women (87%) who received metronidazole were free of bacterial vaginosis 9-21 days after enrollment, compared with only four (17%) of 23 placebo-treated women (P < .001). Women who were cured were followed prospectively. Those who had persistent bacterial vaginosis were crossed over to metronidazole gel in an open trial; bacterial vaginosis was eradicated in 21 of 23 (91%) of these women at the 2-week follow-up. Recurrent bacterial vaginosis developed within 1 month in four (15%) of 26 women who were initially cured after receiving metronidazole gel. Response to therapy was accompanied by a decrease in vaginal Bacteroides, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with intravaginal metronidazole gel resulted in a clinical cure in 87% (placebo-controlled trial) to 91% (crossover trial) of women with bacterial vaginosis. The recurrence rate of 15% at 1 month after treatment is similar to that reported with oral metronidazole.
TI  - The normal vaginal flora, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  - In this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (Lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the basis of a vaginal smear. BV was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with BV, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and 61% of those with a normal flora. H2O2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. The microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with BV included Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia/disiens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Prevotella corporis/Bacteroides levii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mobiluncus species, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus tetradius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis (P < .05 for each). The presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were B. ureolyticus, F. nucleatum, and P. prevotii. Other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without BV. We conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with BV in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with BV and those inhibited by H2O2-producing lactobacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - Prevalence of cervical pathogens in women with and without inflammatory changes on smear testing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess correlation between nonspecific cervicitis, inflammation, or exudate on cervical smears tests and confirmed presence of known cervical pathogens. DESIGN: Investigation of women attending a family practice clinic for smear test by microbiological screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, group B streptococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. SETTING: Family practice teaching clinic in a university hospital. PATIENTS: 411 women presenting for a smear test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of genital infections associated with presence or absence of inflammatory changes on cervical smear. RESULTS: Of the 132 women with inflammatory changes on cervical smear, 64 (48%) had positive cultures. Of the 248 without inflammatory changes, 117 (47%) had positive cultures. Subgroup analysis on individual organisms also showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Reports of inflammatory changes on cervical smear testing are a poor indicator of infection.
TI  - The vagina as an ecologic system. Current understanding and clinical applications.
AB  - Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of dominance of the healthful microecology by Lactobacillus acidophilus through microbicidal enzyme systems has led to renewed interest in ecologic approaches to vaginal health maintenance and treatment of vaginosis and vaginitis. Review of pertinent research suggests that due to inadequate adherence of lactobacilli from dairy sources, contaminants in commercial sources, and lack of evidence of effectiveness in sparse clinical trials, intravaginal applications of L. acidophilus cannot be recommended. Bacterial vaginosis is described in this article as a microecologic shift in the dominant organism of the microecology from L. acidophilus to Gardnerella vaginalis. This results in conditions favorable to vaginal establishment of many anaerobic organisms. The ability to identify and nurture healthful lactobacilli in the vaginal microflora is suggested as a future direction for health-enhancement-oriented research, practice, and screening.
TI  - [How can reinfection by Gardnerella vaginalis be prevented?].
AB  
TI  - Phosphorylation and activation of the arachidonate-mobilizing phospholipase A2 in macrophages in response to bacteria.
AB  - The role of potential target enzymes in the protein-kinase-C-independent eicosanoid response triggered by certain bacteria in murine peritoneal macrophages [Svensson, U., Holst, E. & Sundler, R. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 202, 699-705] has been investigated. The eicosanoid response was found to be due to an increase in the mobilization of arachidonate rather than to inhibition of arachidonate esterification or activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway and to be accompanied by a persistent increase in the activity of the arachidonate-mobilizing phospholipase A2 (PLA2-85). Also, down-regulation of protein-kinase C by prolonged treatment with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not reduce the bacterial activation of PLA2-85. The increase in activity of PLA2-85, like the increase in eicosanoid formation, showed a lag period of approximately 10 min. Furthermore, exposure of 32P-labeled macrophages to either bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis) or the protein-phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid caused an increase in the phosphorylation of PLA2-85. Okadaic acid (0.5 microM), which itself caused arachidonate mobilization and activation of PLA2-85 after a lag period of approximately 45 min, greatly promoted the response to bacteria even at earlier time points. This study provides strong evidence that the eicosanoid response to bacteria in macrophages occurs via a protein-kinase-C-independent activation of PLA2-85 and that this activation is due to an increase in the phosphorylation of the enzyme.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, and ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990 against 1640 isolates belonging to 117 bacterial species. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Bay y 3118 was as active as CI-960 and CI-990, up to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin and up to 16-fold more active than sparfloxacin. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) were sensitive to Bay y 3118. With the exception of ciprofloxacin which was less active, the activities of Bay y 3118 and the other comparator compounds were similar against Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genospecies 3 and Acinetobacter strain 84. Bay y 3118 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at concentrations comparable with those of ciprofloxacin. However, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp. were four times more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to ciprofloxacin. All of the agents tested were equally active against Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria and Bordetella spp. Against staphylococci, Bay y 3118 was the most active compound, followed jointly by CI-990, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and tosufloxacin, and then ciprofloxacin. Bay y 3118 remained highly active against Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to ciprofloxacin; the MIC90 (0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold less than that of CI-990 and sparfloxacin, 32-fold less than that of CI-960 and 128-fold less than that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Against haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis, Bay y 3118 was two- to 16-fold more active than the other compounds. It had only moderate activity against Listeria spp., but this was superior to that of all the other compounds tested. Bay y 3118 was also the most active agent overall against anaerobic bacteria, although CI-960 and CI-990 had slightly better activity against Gardnerella vaginalis. It inhibited Mycobacterium spp. other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium flavescens, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium fortuitum) at concentrations < or = 0.06-4 mg/L and was between two- and 128-fold more active than the other compounds against these isolates; the two strains each of Mycobacterium terrae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum were resistant to Bay y 3118. In this study, Bay y 3118 was shown to be the most active and most broad-spectrum of the new quinolone and naphthyridine derivatives.
TI  - Comparative susceptibility of the Bacteroides fragilis group species and other anaerobic bacteria to meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole was determined against 395 strains of strict and facultative anaerobes, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp. and Mobiluncus spp. The activities of meropenem and imipenem were within one dilution of their MIC50 and MIC90 values. One isolate of Bacteroides fragilis, two of Bacteroides distasonis, and two of Bacteroides ovatus showed resistance or diminished susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem. Metronidazole was active against almost all obligate anaerobic isolates. Some non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacilli and lactobacilli were resistant. Ampicillin/sulbactam inhibited almost all isolates at < or = 16/8 mg/L. The activity of clindamycin and cefoxitin was relatively good, but some strains of non-fragilis B. fragilis group species were resistant. Piperacillin was the least active agent tested.
TI  - [Recent bacteriologic data: from physiopathology to treatment].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a change in the vaginal ecosystem in which Lactobacillus spp, the dominant members of the normal flora, are replaced by an association of various bacterial species including Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes (Bacteroides spp, Prevotella spp, Porphyromonas spp, Peptostreptococcus spp and Mobiluncus spp) and Mycoplasma hominis. The reasons for this imbalance are unknown, although the loss of lactobacilli that produce hydrogen peroxide (which is toxic for G. vaginalis and numerous anaerobes) may be an essential element. The introduction of one or several of these species into the vagina (they can occasionally be isolated in small numbers even in the absence of vaginosis) following intercourse or from the intestinal tract may also play a role. G. vaginalis itself is not considered to cause vaginosis, but is almost always present and multiplies rapidly; in addition, it has a high capacity for adherence to epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. It is now agreed that the concomitant growth of one or several anaerobic species is required for bacterial vaginosis to develop. Our knowledge of the bacteriology of bacterial vaginosis has implications for diagnosis and treatment. It is now possible to obtain a precise bacteriologic diagnosis, not by culturing G. vaginalis (a costly and low-yield procedure), but by direct examination of the vaginal flora after Gram staining, which shows the replacement of lactobacilli by a characteristic polymorphic flora. Therapy is based on the use of antibiotics such as the imidazoles, which are active against G. vaginalis and anaerobes, but not against the commensal lactobacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The bacteriologic diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in an urban practice].
AB  - The term "bacterial vaginosis" carries both bacteriologic and clinical connotations. Indeed, it implies that the vagina is uninflamed (as shown by the absence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils), but that potential pathogens (particularly Gardnerella vaginalis) are present. Many studies conducted over the last 10 years have shown that a tentative diagnosis is simple to make, based on the sniff test, the aspect of the vaginal discharge, the presence of clue cells, and the absence of polymorphonuclear cells and lactobacilli on fresh smears. However, classical treatment with metronidazole can be insufficient given the innumerable microbial associations, and a more thorough bacteriological diagnosis is required. The presence of anaerobes is suggested by a positive sniff test. Direct examination reveals small Gram-negative rods in clue cells, but cannot differentiate between commensal atypical lactobacilli and Gram-positive anaerobes. Culture with CO2 supplementation or in anaerobic conditions yields Bacteroides and Mobiluncus spp, frequently associated with Gardnerella vaginalis and pathogenic Fusobacterium spp. Culture in appropriate conditions will detect metronidazole-resistant Propionibacteria and pathogenic anaerobic cocci. Antibiotic susceptibility testing of these organisms is costly and time-consuming, but can avoid therapeutic failures. Gardnerella vaginalis is also frequently associated in bacterial vaginosis with endogenous (mainly E. coli and group B streptococci) and Ureaplasma. Antibiotic susceptibility testing is useful if the predominant members of the flora are Gram-negative aerobes, group D streptococci or pathogenic anaerobes. Bacterial vaginosis is simple to diagnose but poses a real therapeutic problem since some cases call for a simple readjustment of the commensal flora while others require full chemotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical and colposcopic aspects of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by an uniform, malodorous, white-grey discharge. The presenting symptom is generally the unpleasant smell of the vaginal discharge, particularly following the menses or intercourse. Other functional signs, such as pruritus, dysuria and dyspareunia are rare. Inflammatory signs are frequent, and can be revealed by colposcopy with the Lugol test: this shows punctuate colpitis with small regular points corresponding histologically to an inflammatory focus in the connective tissue. The term "vaginitis" is avoided because of the absence of polymorphonuclear cells in the vaginal discharge, despite the presence of inflammation. Bacterial vaginosis has been held responsible for prematurity, small birthweight and post-partum infection. Nonetheless, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp can be recovered from the vaginal flora of women with no signs of inflammation.
TI  - [The definition and epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a condition with a flora change in the vaginal where a lactobacilli-dominated flora is exchanged with an abundant complex flora dominated by strict and facultative anaerobic bacteria. The condition seldom occurs in prepubertal girls and post-menopausal women, suggesting an hormonal component in its etiology. Recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis are frequent. Three out of four criteria should be fulfilled for establishing the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, i.e., an increased (often homogeneous) vaginal discharge, a positive amine test, the presence of a great number of clue cells, a vaginal pH > or = 4.5. There are no hard data supporting that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. Cytological changes (CIN I, II, III) have been found more often in women with bacterial vaginosis than in those without this condition. It has been proposed that nitrosamines from the abundant vaginal bacterial flora may be oncogenic, a correlation which, however, needs to be proved. The reservoir for one or more of the bacterial vaginosis-associated organism, e.g., some Bacteroides and Mobiluncus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis, is probably the distal intestinal tract and the mouth. Sparse or even a moderate number of clue cells are present in many women who do not have bacterial vaginosis. A vaginal pH of 4.7 seems to be a better cut-off level than 4.5. There is a statistical correlation between bacterial vaginosis and obstetrical complications.
TI  - Tumour necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 2 in normal and infected human seminal fluid.
AB  - The presence of cytokines such as the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and interleukin 2 (IL2) in human spermatozoa is still to be defined. The aim of this study was to measure the concentration of both soluble factors in seminal fluid. Data from normal semen samples (n = 24) confirmed the presence of IL2 (258 +/- 84 fmol/ml corresponding to 953 +/- 369 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) and TNF alpha (62.2 +/- 16.4 fmol/ml corresponding to 231.3 +/- 86 fmol/total volume of ejaculate). A significant positive correlation (r = 0.59; P < 0.01) was observed between the TNF alpha and the IL2 concentrations. The concentrations of these cytokines were not related to sperm parameters. In contrast, IL2 concentrations (196.9 +/- 60.4 fmol/ml; 686.2 +/- 236.7 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) evaluated in 16 seminal fluids with identified bacterial agents were lower than in the control group, whereas TNF alpha concentrations (68.6 +/- 12.3 fmol/ml; 241.3 +/- 78.9 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) were not significantly different from the controls. Further studies are needed to determine the potential role of these cytokines in the physiology of semen and their usefulness as indicators of reproductive pathology.
TI  - Perinatal effects of Gardnerella vaginalis deciduitis in the rabbit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We determined the effects of intrauterine infection with Gardnerella vaginalis on maternal and fetal outcome in the rabbit. STUDY DESIGN: Both uterine horns of rabbits on day 20 or 21 of gestation (70% of gestation) were inoculated hysteroscopically with either 0.2 ml of 10(5) to 10(7) CFU/ml of G. vaginalis or saline solution. Animals were killed on day 4 or earlier if premature delivery occurred. The following outcome parameters were evaluated: febrile morbidity, preterm labor and delivery, maternal cultures, fetal birth weight, and fetal neuropathologic findings. RESULTS: G. vaginalis intrauterine inoculation uniformly resulted in amnionitis and deciduitis. Animals inoculated with G. vaginalis had no greater incidence of fever and preterm delivery than did saline-treated control animals. However, intrauterine infection with G. vaginalis resulted in a significant decrease in the live birth rate when compared with that of controls (80% vs 95%, p < 0.03). G. vaginalis deciduitis was associated with as 23% reduction in the birth weight of the surviving fetuses. Furthermore, animals in the G. vaginalis study group had a 60% incidence of severe brain injury compared with 0% in the saline solution group. CONCLUSION: G. vaginalis amnionitis and deciduitis produced minimal maternal morbidity but were associated with decreased birth weight and brain injury in surviving fetuses; thus it appears that G. vaginalis selectively functions as a fetal, but not maternal, pathogen in the rabbit.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  - Rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. High concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. Like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), Streptococcus spp. (MIC50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC50, 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 0.25 microgram/ml). Rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting Bacteroides bivius-disiens, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., and Mobiluncus spp. strains (all MICs < or = 1 microgram/ml). Strains of Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. However, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were rifaximin resistant, for example, Candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to rifamycin resistance.

TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis in infections of reproductive organs].
AB  - The study was aimed at multidirectional studies on bacteria isolated from smears  from vagina and cervix uteri in 226 patients with inflammatory states of their reproductive organs. Most frequently isolated aerobic bacteria were Gram-negative--27%, mainly E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis--in 18% of cases. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 81% of cases: Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 28% and Lactobacillus in 53% of cases. Other anaerobic bacteria were: Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (15.5%), Streptococcus sp. (15.9%), and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (14.1%). Gardnerella vaginalis was most frequently found in chronic cases of vaginosis (41.7%). All strains of G. vaginalis were susceptible to cefotaxime, while 15-40% of them were resistant to gentamycin, tetracycline and metronidazole.
TI  - [Prevalence of 4 agents of sexually transmitted diseases in leukorrhea in Abidjan (Ivory Coast)].
AB  - 6,603 women with vaginal discharges were investigated for genital infection with  four sexually transmitted diseases. Germs of vaginitis were isolated with prevalence as following: C. albicans 25%, G. vaginalis 17.4%, T. vaginalis 8.2%. Cervicitis with N. gonorrhoeae represented 3.2% of cases.

The teenagers are a group particularly affected. The objective of this article is to report the etiology of STD in a group of teenagers, out-patients at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia (INPer). The study includes 1360 patients at the clinic of STD at the INPer, 8.5 percent were less than 20 years old; 18.9 percent of them had previously a STD. The most frequent pathology was cervicovaginitis and the most frequently isolated pathogens were Candida sp, Gardnerella vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. There were no cases of gonorrhea. Three patients had Immunodeficiency Syndrome.

TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis infection and sexual contact in female children.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) infection has been reported as being acquired via sexual contact in adults and as an indicator of sexual contact in female children (DeJong, 1985). The purpose of this study was to determine if GV infection was more commonly found in 191 female children who gave a history of sexual contact and/or were infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) or Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) (Group 1), compared with 144 female children evaluated for possible sexual abuse and found to have no such history or infection with GC or CT (Group 2), or 31 female children (friends of the authors) without such a history or GC or CT infection (Group 3). Vaginal GV was found in 5.3% of Group 1, 4.9% of Group 2 and 6.4% of Group 3 (p > .05). Also, vaginal GV infection was not related to the type of sexual contact or race, but did increase with age in white female children. Because vaginal GV infection is not more commonly found in children with a history of sexual contact than those without such a history, the finding of GV in a vaginal culture in an individual case would not be a reliable marker of sexual contact. Routine culturing for GV is not recommended as part of a sexual abuse workup.
TI  - [Benzidamine in the topical treatment of vaginitis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - The present clinical trial has been carried out in order to evaluate the efficacy of benzydamine in treatment of vaginitis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis. Fifty women affected by this specific pathology have been submitted to topical treatment with 0.5% benzydamine vaginal cream. The treatment has been carried out for 9 consecutive days using a local application of benzydamine twice a day. The clinical result was evaluated after 12 and 60 days. The following parameters were taken into consideration: symptoms (leucorrhea, itching, burning), clinical signs (oedema, hyperemia, vaginal secretion), instrumental data (pH, colposcopy, sniff test) and microbiological findings (searching of clue cells, Lactobacillus and Gardnerella vaginalis). At the first check point after 12 days 84% of patients have been considered healed; at the second check the percentage of healing rose to 92%. Therefore benzydamine was considered highly effective in 92% of vaginitis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis.
TI  - Infection and labor. VIII. Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in patients  with suspected cervical incompetence: prevalence and clinical significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in patients presenting with cervical dilatation in the midtrimester of pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Amniocentesis for microbial studies was performed in women admitted with cervical dilatation > or = 2 cm, intact membranes, and without active labor between 14 and 24 weeks of gestation. Amniotic fluid was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, as well as for mycoplasmas. Gram stain was performed on all samples. RESULTS: The prevalence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity was 51.5% (17/33). The most common microbial isolates were Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans, and Fusobacterium sp. All patients with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity had complications. Patients who underwent cervical cerclage in the presence of a positive amniotic fluid culture had rupture of membranes, clinical chorioamnionitis, or pregnancy loss. On the other hand, the prognosis of patients with a negative amniotic fluid culture was better than that of patients with a positive culture. Of 16 patients with a negative amniotic culture, nine were delivered at > 34 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity occurs frequently in women presenting with cervical dilatation in the midtrimester; (2) the microbiologic state of the amniotic cavity is an important prognostic factor for pregnancy outcome; (3) amniocentesis to determine the microbiologic characteristics of the amniotic cavity should be considered before a cerclage is placed in women presenting with cervical dilatation in the midtrimester.
TI  - [Isolation and identification of Gardnerella vaginalis in women with symptoms of  bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - 70 samples of vaginal secretions were collected from women with bacterial vaginosis syndrome, that were attended in Nuevo Veranillo' Health Center. All samples were tested in order to determinate the presence of amine and to Gram'methods stain to observe the morphologic characteristics of the "Clue" cells (epithelial cells with adhered bacteria). Samples were cultured in a selective media of blood agar in Columbia base with colistine and nalidixic acid, and incubated in an environment of CO2 at 37 degrees C. Tests of oxidase, catalase, glucid fermentation, hippurate hydrolysis and starch hydrolysis were made on the grown colonies. 27 out of 70 samples resulted in positive cultures for Gardnerella vaginalis, 11 to pregnant women and 16 to nonpregnant women; among these, 14 women used some kind of contraceptive methods as DIU or pill.
TI  - Physical characterization of the pore forming cytolysine from Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The cytolytic toxin (CTox) produced by Gardnerella vaginalis is able to form voltage-dependent cationic channels when incorporated in lipid membranes (Moran et al. (1991) FEBS Lett. 283, 317-320). Osmotic protection experiments show that toxin incorporated in human erythrocytes forms pores between 18 A and 28 A in diameter. A hypothesis of pore formation as a primary event to produce cytolysis is proposed. The CTox activity increases when cells are depolarized by increasing the extracellular K+ concentration, probably reflecting the voltage dependent character of CTox formed channels. The cytolytic effect of the toxin was prevented by low temperatures and was a function of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, suggesting a Ca2+ influx as part of the lytic mechanism. Binding of CTox to erythrocytes was dependent on external Ca2+ and was less temperature-dependent. Dose-response analysis suggests cooperativity of the toxin for the lytic activity, although no direct evidence of oligomerization has been found.
TI  - Inflammation on the cervical Papanicolaou smear: the predictive value for infection in asymptomatic women.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of inflammation on the cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smear of asymptomatic women is unknown. This study assessed the possible association between inflammation on Pap smears with the presence of cervical/vaginal pathogens. METHODS: A questionnaire was given to 290 asymptomatic women seen for routine gynecologic examination, including Pap smear, in a primary care setting. The women were tested for the presence of Candida species, Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonnorrhoeae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. RESULTS: Recovery of Chlamydia and Trichomonas was more frequent in women with inflammation on Pap smear than in women without inflammation, but the positive predictive value of inflammation was only 7% for Chlamydia and 14% for Trichomonas. Seventy-one percent of the women with inflammation had no evidence of any of the organisms. After a 6-month follow-up period, women with inflammation on Pap smear were no more likely than their matched counterparts without inflammation to return for a clinic visit with symptoms of vaginitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, inflammation on Pap smear had a relatively low predictive value for the presence of vaginal pathogens in asymptomatic women.

TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis: characteristics, clinical considerations, and controversies.
AB  - The clinical significance, Gram stain reaction, and genus affiliation of Gardnerella vaginalis have been controversial since Gardner and Dukes described the organism as the cause of "nonspecific vaginitis," a common disease of women which is now called bacterial vaginosis. The organism was named G. vaginalis when taxonomic studies showed that it was unrelated to bacteria in various genera including Haemophilus and Corynebacterium. Electron microscopy and chemical analyses have elucidated the organism's gram-variable reaction. Controversy over the etiology of bacterial vaginosis was largely resolved by (i) studies using improved media and methods for the isolation and identification of bacteria in vaginal fluids and (ii) standardization of criteria for clinical and laboratory diagnosis. Besides G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., Mycoplasma hominis, and certain obligate anaerobes are now acknowledged as participants in bacterial vaginosis. The finding that G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and M. hominis inhabit the rectum indicates a potential source of autoinfection in addition to sexual transmission. Extravaginal infections with G. vaginalis are increasingly recognized, especially when the toxic anticoagulant polyanetholesulfonate is omitted from blood cultures and when urine cultures are incubated anaerobically for 48 h. The finding that mares harbor G. vaginalis suggests that an equine model can be developed for studies of Gardnerella pathogenesis.
TI  - A collaborative study of the in-vitro sensitivity to RP 59500 of bacteria isolated in seven hospitals in France.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of RP 59500 was determined against 1051 recent clinical bacterial isolates. The susceptibility to RP 59500 was determined with an agar dilution technique for all the isolates, while MICs and MBCs were determined for 82 selected strains in broth. Isolates of both Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci appeared to be potentially susceptible to RP 59500, independent of susceptibility to methicillin or MLS resistance. (S. aureus: methicillin-sensitive, MIC90, 1.0 mg/L; methicillin-resistant, MIC90 1.0 mg/L; coagulase-negative staphylococci: methicillin-sensitive, MIC90 0.5 mg/L). Lancefield group A, B, C and G streptococci (MIC50 0.5 and MIC90 1.0 mg/L) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 0.5 and MIC90 1.0 mg/L) appeared to be susceptible to RP 59500. Some Streptococcus spp. and enterococci as well as Listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by a higher concentration of RP 59500 (enterococci: MIC90 4 mg/L, range 0.125-16 mg/L). Comparatively low MICs were seen when Legionella spp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Gardnerella vaginalis were tested. Broth dilution MIC/MBC determinations showed no evidence of tolerance, as MIC values were within two dilutions of MBC values. RP 59500 might be a useful compound in the treatment of infections caused by a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to methicillin and/or macrolides.
TI  - Involvement of Gardnerella vaginalis in urinary tract infections in men.
AB  - Fifteen male patients from whose urine samples Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated (clinical incidence of 0.1%) were evaluated for clinical signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection and modality of acquisition of the organism. Ten of 15 (67%) patients were symptomatic or had signs of inflammation as manifested by an increased number of urinary neutrophils. One patient had two bouts of infection caused by this organism which required two courses of antibiotic therapy. Colonies of diphtheroidlike organisms found in urine cultures should not be ignored as insignificant but should be further investigated to determine whether G. vaginalis is present.
TI  - Comparison of the vaginal flora in sexually abused and nonabused girls.
AB  - The presence of sexually transmitted pathogens in the vagina of the sexually abused girl may provide direct evidence of sexual abuse; the presence of other abnormal vaginal organisms may provide indirect evidence of abuse. To identify abnormal vaginal organisms, we prospectively studied the flora of 209 sexually abused girls (cases) and compared it with that in a concurrent control group of 108 girls. Case and control subjects were from the same community, were predominantly white, and 71% of each group were 3 to 10 years of age. The sexually transmitted pathogens (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex virus) were isolated exclusively from the case group at a low frequency (less than 1%). The isolation of Mycoplasma species exclusively in the case group (4%), and of Gardnerella vaginalis in 7% of the case group versus 1% of the control group, suggests that both these organisms may be sexually transmitted. Other bacteria also were collectively more frequent in the case group (16% vs 6%). There may be an association between sexual activity and colonization of the lower genital tract in young girls.
TI  - [Epidemiological factors and vaginal flora changes in vaginal bacteriosis (bacterial vaginosis)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to know the modifications of the vaginal bacterial flora that occurs in bacterial vaginosis and to know the involvement of these microorganisms and the influence of several epidemiologic factors in the etiology of this disease. METHODS: We studied, by using semiquantitative cultures and GLC, vaginal washings from 50 healthy women and 50 women with bacterial vaginosis. RESULTS: The most remarkable results were the high sensitivity of Amsel's criteria and their good correlation with GLC. Women with bacterial vaginosis showed a great increase of CFUs/ml of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and several species of anaerobic bacteria, and an important decrease of the amounts of aerobic lactobacilli. The main epidemiologic factor among those that were studied was the use of IUDs. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of bacterial vaginosis is associated with the increase of the amounts of G. vaginalis, Bacteroides or related genera (Prevotella, Porphyromonas), and probably M. hominis and U. urealyticum, also being associated to a decrease of the amounts of aerobic lactobacilli. These facts are probably related with alteration in the ecologic relationship lactobacilli/G. vaginalis/anaerobic bacteria.

TI  - The effects of a combined contraceptive vaginal ring releasing ethinyloestradiol  and 3-ketodesogestrel on vaginal flora.
AB  - Fifty nine women with documented normal ovulatory cycles and with no symptoms of  vaginal infection were divided into four groups. Each group used a combined contraceptive vaginal ring (CCVR) with a mean daily release rate of 0.015 mg of ethinyloestradiol (EE) and 0.120 mg of 3-ketodesogestrel (3-KDG) per day, for one cycle of either 21, 28, 42, or 56 days. Cultures from the posterior vaginal fornix and from the endocervical canal were obtained immediately before insertion of the ring and on removal of the ring. Changes in the numbers of vaginal cells, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, yeasts and Trichomonas vaginalis were documented at the end of each treatment. Intra- and inter- group changes in the vaginal flora were assessed at the end of each treatment. The comparison between the number and type of flora showed no significant change between the pre-treatment population and the post-treatment population. The results of this study suggest that the use of this CCVR for 21, 28, 42 and 56 days is not associated with an increase in inflammatory cells or pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Comparison of ofloxacin and metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ofloxacin, 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, was compared with metronidazole, 400 mg twice daily for 7 days, for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Diagnosis of BV was confirmed by at least 3 of the following 4 criteria: the presence of an abnormal vaginal discharge on examination, clue cells on microscopy of vaginal specimens, vaginal pH greater than 5.0 and a positive amine test. Vaginal specimens were examined for Mobiluncus spp, analysed for the succinate/lactate (S/L) ratio and cultured for Trichomonas vaginalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mycoplasma hominis. Patients were reviewed on completion of treatment (visit 2) and 14 days later (visit 3). The diagnosis of BV was accepted in 119 of 149 patients recruited, 60 of whom received treatment with ofloxacin and 59 received metronidazole. Sixty-two patients, 31 in each treatment group, completed the study. Diagnostic cure at visit 2 was significantly better in the metronidazole group with cure rates of 56% (metronidazole) vs 23% (ofloxacin) (P = 0.001); this was associated with higher eradication rates for G. vaginalis (100% vs 56%) and Bacteroides spp. (97% vs 49%). There were no significant differences between the two groups in clinical cure at either visit 2 or 3 or in diagnostic cure at visit 3. Both treatments were well tolerated. We conclude that metronidazole is likely to remain the first choice of treatment for BV but ofloxacin offers a safe and effective alternative.
TI  - Mycoplasma hominis in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - An association between M. hominis and bacterial vaginosis (BV) was looked for in  total 205 women characterized as having BV. Vaginal specimens from these patients were studied for the presence of amines, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, clue cells, and lactobacilli, and were also cultured to isolate Gardnerella vaginalis, M. hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans and anaerobes. G. vaginalis was found to be the most common isolate from 132 cases (64.3%). M. hominis was isolated from 90 cases (43.9%). 62 per cent of M. hominis isolates were associated with G. vaginalis. 100 age matched control group revealed low prevalence of G. vaginalis and M. hominis whereas the difference in isolation rate of anaerobes was not significant. Anaerobes were found in association with M. hominis in 40 per cent cases. The treatment of these patients was decided after knowing the etiological agent.
TI  - [Prevalence of G. vaginalis, Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, T. vaginalis, yeast, N. gonorrhoeae and other bacteria in women with vaginal discharge].
AB  - Vaginal discharge of 118 women attended to outdoor clinics of obstetrics and gynaecology at Medical Faculty of Ankara University (A.U.T.F.), have been examined. Direct microscopy has been made by means of wet mount, Gram and Giemsa staining. Vaginal pH has been measured, by 10% KOH the presence of "fishy odor" has been investigated. For culturing vaginal secretions in Amies transport medium have been brought to Microbiology Department of Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine Inoculations have been made on to Blood agar, MacConkey agar, Sabouraud Dextrose agar, New York City. Medium, % 5 Human blood bilayer Tween 80 Medium (HBT), Vivey Trichomonas Agar Medium and into M-broth and U9 broth. In this study, we have isolated 9 (7.62%) Gardnerella vaginalis, 41 (33.89%) Ureaplasma, 13 (11.01%) Mycoplasma, 25 (21.18%) yeasts, 4 (3.38%) Trichomonas vaginalis and 43 (36.46%) various bacteria, 26 cases were found to have polymicrobial etiology.
TI  - Vaginitis in non pregnant women in Haryana.
AB  - Study was carried out in 100 patients of non-specific vaginitis (NSV) to find out the incidence of vaginitis due to G. vaginalis. Out of a total of 100 subjects 20 were positive for G. vaginalis as compared to only 6 in equal number of normal matched controls. One positive specimen showed concomitant presence of C. albicans and E. coli was found in another positive specimen. Presence of amines and clue cells in the discharge did not correlate with the isolation rate of G. vaginalis, thus emphasizing the necessity of culture to diagnose NSV due to G. vaginalis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in vitro of cefpirome against clinical isolates causing sexually transmitted diseases.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefpirome was compared with other antibiotics against organisms causing sexually transmitted diseases (STD). The excellent activity of cefpirome against Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 1.0 mg/L), Haemophilus ducreyi (MIC90 0.5 mg/L), and Gardnerella vaginalis (MIC90 1.0 mg/L) suggests that this agent might be useful in the empirical treatment of a variety of venereal diseases.
TI  - The relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  - Lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. The role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. Vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of H2O2-positive and H2O2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. Compared with women with H2O2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized by H2O2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and viridans streptococci (P less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). In addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with H2O2-positive lactobacilli to have Chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by Enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than .05 for each comparison). Vaginal colonization by group B streptococci or Escherichia coli was not related to the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli. These data suggest that the presence of H2O2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.
TI  - Prenatal microbiological risk factors associated with preterm birth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the vaginal flora of pregnant women at 22-28 weeks gestation  to determine whether the presence of specific micro-organisms is significantly associated with preterm birth and prelabour rupture of the membranes. DESIGN: A comprehensive descriptive prospective study of the vaginal micro-flora of women between 22-28 weeks gestation comparing those who gave birth preterm (less than 37 weeks) with those who gave birth at term. Microbiological assessment included cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, genital mycoplasmas and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to account for confounding obstetric and demographic variables. SETTING: The Queen Victoria Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia. SUBJECTS: 135 women who gave birth preterm compared to 651 women who gave birth at term. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Preterm birth and preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM) RESULTS: The prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis between 22-28 weeks was significantly higher in women who gave birth preterm compared to women who gave birth at term (23% vs 15%; multiple logistic regression odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.01-3.2, P less than 0.05. Ureaplasma urealyticum was also found in a higher proportion of women who gave birth preterm (49% vs 32% OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6, P less than 0.0005). Preterm PROM occurred in 42% of whom 60% were carriers of U. urealyticum between 22-28 weeks, compared with 32% in the term group (OR 3.2, CI 1.7-6.1, P less than 0.0005). When women who received antibiotics between the midtrimester swab and labour were excluded, G. vaginalis was also significantly associated with preterm PROM (OR 2.7, CI 1.1-6.5, P less than 0.05). The presence of vaginal enteropharyngeal bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus spp., Staph. aureus) in the midtrimester was not predictive of preterm birth, but when these organisms were found in labour, they appeared to have been acquired later in the pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Women carrying G. vaginalis or U. urealyticum during the midtrimester had nearly twice the risk of preterm birth, while women positive for U. urealyticum had more than a threefold risk of preterm PROM.
TI  - Sialidases (neuraminidases) in bacterial vaginosis and bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis, Prevotella species, and Bacteroides species have been associated with prematurity and upper genital tract infection. Prevotella (Bacteroides) species and Bacteroides fragilis have also been associated with preterm birth. However, the mechanism by which lower genital tract infection causes upper genital tract disease remains poorly understood. Sialidases (neuraminidases) are enzymes which enhance the ability of microorganisms to invade and destroy tissue. Elevated levels of sialidase activity were detected in 42 (84%) of 50 vaginal fluid specimens from women with bacterial vaginosis and none of 19 vaginal fluids from women without bacterial vaginosis (P less than 0.001). Vaginal fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis had a median specific activity of 9.8 U compared to 2.5 U of sialidase in women without bacterial vaginosis (P less than 0.001). In order to determine the probable source of sialidases in vaginal fluid, the microorganisms recovered from women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment were assayed. Of 28 specimens from women with bacterial vaginosis, 27 (96%) yielded sialidase-positive bacteria, at a median concentration of 10(6.5) CFU/ml of vaginal fluid. Prevotella and Bacteroides species accounted for the sialidase activity in 26 of the vaginal fluids, and Gardnerella vaginalis accounted for the sialidase activity in the remaining fluid. After treatment, sialidase was detected in the vaginal fluid of 1 (5%) of 22 women who responded to therapy and in all of 6 women for whom therapy failed. These data suggest that vaginal fluid sialidase is highly correlated with bacterial vaginosis and that the probable sources for this enzyme activity are the Bacteroides and Prevotella species present in the vagina.
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in a routine diagnostic laboratory.
AB  - Vaginal swabs from 299 hospital and general practitioners' patients were examined for Gardnerella vaginalis by Gram film and by culture, G. vaginalis was isolated in 12% of cultures. Comparison between the 'clue' cell and culture methods suggested that the former is a rapid, acceptable routine screening method for the detection of G. vaginalis. The value of the traditional method of identifying G. vaginalis by sensitivity testing is questioned. All specimens were also examined by Gram film and culture, for the presence of Mobiluncus spp, which was detected in 8.4% of specimens by Gram film but only 0.7% by culture. From a questionnaire returned by 84% of clinicians, metronidazole was found to be the most commonly used antimicrobial agent for the treatment of G. vaginalis, and in all but one case appeared to be clinically effective.
TI  - A microbiological study of vaginal discharge in women attending a Malaysian gynaecological clinic.
AB  - Vaginal discharge is a common complaint of women attending gynaecological clinics. The purpose of this study was to compare the occurrence of commonly implicated microorganisms in vaginal discharge amongst women with or without the complaint, attending a gynaecological and family planning clinic. The association of Gardnerella vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis was also studied. It was found that there were no significant differences between the cases and controls in the isolation rate of Gardnerella vaginalis, Torulopsis glabrata, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma ssp and Group B streptococcus (p greater than 0.05). Only the isolation rate of Candida albicans was significantly higher in the cases than controls (p less than 0.01). However, there was a significant association of G. vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - High levels of Gardnerella vaginalis detected with an oligonucleotide probe combined with elevated pH as a diagnostic indicator of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - We have demonstrated a new approach to diagnosing bacterial vaginosis (BV) that is based on measuring the concentration of Gardnerella vaginalis in vaginal fluid with DNA probes. G. vaginalis is virtually always present at high concentrations in women who have BV but is also detected frequently in normal women, usually at concentrations of less than 10(7) CFU/ml of vaginal fluid. Elevated vaginal pH is another sensitive indicator of BV, although it can occur in conjunction with other conditions. We have proposed that quantitative measurements of G. vaginalis using specific DNA probes can serve as a useful aid in diagnosing BV, provided the vaginal pH is above 4.5. To test this hypothesis, a group of 113 women were first evaluated for BV by the standard set of clinical signs. Vaginal washes were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by quantitative culture for the concentration of G. vaginalis. Portions of these same samples were immobilized on nylon filters, along with standards for quantitation. The filters were incubated with a radiolabelled oligonucleotide specific for G. vaginalis 16S rRNA, and the subsequent autoradiographs were examined to determine levels of G. vaginalis in each sample. G. vaginalis at concentrations of greater than or equal to 2 x 10(7) CFU/ml and vaginal pH of greater than 4.5 were then analyzed for concurrence with the diagnoses based on clinical criteria. Results of this slot blot analysis gave a sensitivity of 95%, correctly categorizing 41 of 43 BV-positive specimens, and a specificity of 99%, correctly identifying 69 of 70 BV-negative specimens, compared with diagnosis based on clinical criteria.
TI  - Characteristics of three vaginal flora patterns assessed by gram stain among pregnant women. Vaginal Infections and Prematurity Study Group.
AB  - This study was undertaken to define the characteristics and persistence of vaginal flora in 7918 pregnant women at 23 to 26 weeks' gestation. Vaginal smears were categorized as normal (predominant lactobacilli), intermediate (reduced lactobacilli), or positive for bacterial vaginosis. The women with normal flora were least likely to have elevated vaginal pH, amine odor, milky discharge, or colonization by Gardnerella, Bacteroides, or genital mycoplasmas. Women with intermediate vaginal flora had intermediate frequencies of these clinical signs and microorganisms. Group B streptococci and yeast were associated with normal or intermediate flora, whereas Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were recovered more frequently from women with intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis. Trichomonas vaginalis was most associated with intermediate flora. At follow-up, 81% of the women with normal flora had remained normal. Of the women with intermediate flora, 32% acquired bacterial vaginosis and 30% shifted to normal flora. Only 12% of the women with bacterial vaginosis had shifted to normal flora. We conclude that there are two primary stable vaginal flora patterns (normal flora or bacterial vaginosis) and a third less distinct transitional flora pattern between these two.
TI  - Vaginal microbial flora as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of uterine cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
AB  - The vaginal microbial flora of 106 women with histopathologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and 79 women without disease, was evaluated for Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans and other yeasts. Flora morphology was assessed by gram staining of secretions. Cervical cultures were examined for Herpes Simplex virus, Cytomegalovirus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Chlamydia trachomatis antigens in cervical secretions were detected by enzyme immunoassay. Human Papillomavirus was identified by koilocytosis in cytologic or histopathologic specimens. Human Papillomavirus infection (P less than 0.00001), vaginal infection with Mycoplasma hominis (P = 0.012) and abnormal vaginal flora (P = 0.006) were significantly associated with CIN, suggesting that CIN may be promoted by vaginal microorganisms in conjunction with human papillomavirus cervical infection.
TI  - Heterogeneity in restriction patterns of Gardnerella vaginalis isolates from individuals with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - This study was undertaken to resolve the genetic make up of Gardnerella vaginalis present in bacterial vaginosis (BV). DNA from several G. vaginalis isolates from within and between individual BV patients were compared by BamHI, ClaI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) followed by a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) study, utilizing a 5.7-kb BamHI G. vaginalis ATCC14018 DNA probe. Four G. vaginalis isolates from one patient (GVP-062) were composed of 3 different biotypes (biotypes 3, 5 and 8), and while the REA mirrored the biotype, in RFLP studies at least 3 isolates had DNA fragments in common. All of the isolates from 2 other patients (GVP-063 and GVP-072) represented a single biotype (biotype 2), but under REA and in RFLP studies, the isolates GVP-063 differed from GVP-072. An opposite case existed with the isolates GVP-072 (biotype 2) and GVP-065 (biotype 5), which appeared similar under REA and in RFLP studies. Finally, reisolates after 8 weeks (GVP-080) from a BV patient (isolates GVP-065) representing the same biotype (biotype 5) differed under REA and in RFLP studies. Thus, lacking any unique DNA fingerprint, G. vaginalis occurring in BV represents a (genetically) mixed population.
TI  - Report on Gardnerella vaginitis.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginitis is one of the most common diagnoses in our outpatient clinic. From January 1, 1989 through July 30, 1989 we had 230 positive cultures for G. vaginitis. Eighty-three compliant patients in this group had unabated symptoms with documented positive cultures for Gardnerella after treatment with metronidazole. This led to the use of alternative regimens of ceftriaxone or clindamycin. A survey of antibiotic choice and post-treatment culture obtained 103 entries from 34 active duty women soldiers and 60 women dependents. This paper presents the results of the survey after an introduction beginning with a 1953 article in U.S. Armed Forces Medical Journal.

TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in a gynaecology clinic.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in women referred to a gynaecology clinic, and to compare two methods of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. SETTING: Gynaecology Clinic at Northwick Park Hospital SUBJECTS: 114 women aged 16 to 65 referred consecutively to the gynaecology clinic of one consultant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection of bacterial vaginosis by standard compound criteria and by examination of a Gram stained smear of fluid from the posterior vaginal fornix. RESULTS: Bacterial vaginosis was detected by both the Gram stain and the compound criteria in 13 women. There was no correlation between the symptom of vaginal discharge and the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in this population, but the presence of discharge noted by the clinician was associated with bacterial vaginosis. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis was 11%. The Gram stain provides a simple and inexpensive method for laboratory confirmation of bacterial vaginosis where facilities for using the compound criteria are not available.
TI  - Effects of chlorhexidine gluconate douche on normal vaginal flora.
AB  - The effects of a 0.5% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) douche on the normal  vaginal flora of twenty healthy nonpregnant volunteers were investigated. The douche was applied in a premeasured 180-ml quantity daily for 7 consecutive days. Specimens for aerobic and anaerobic culture of the vaginal flora were obtained on 3 occasions from each volunteer, once before and twice after CHG use. The culture results were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. A blood sample was also collected within 24 h of the last CHG application to determine serum CHG concentration. Lactobacillus spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most prevalent aerobic bacteria at all phases of the study and Bacteroides spp. were the most prevalent anaerobes. The composition of the normal flora was essentially the same 30 days after the last dose as the pretreatment flora. Small amounts of CHG were detected in the serum of all but one subject. No untoward effects on the participants were observed. Candida albicans counts were slightly higher, but prevalence was not significantly increased at the end of the study.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin and other antimicrobial agents against genital  pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was determined for 60 strains of Neisseria  gonorrhoeae, 15 strains of Chlamydia trachomatis and 40 strains each of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum and compared with those of ampicillin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, ofloxacin, temafloxacin and tetracycline. Sparfloxacin was active against all the strains studied and appeared to be the most potent quinolone tested. Sparfloxacin had the lowest MICs against N. gonorrhoeae (MICs 0.002-0.06 micrograms/ml). Its MICs against C. trachomatis (0.03-0.06 micrograms/ml) were higher than those of clarithromycin but lower than those of the other antimicrobial agents. Sparfloxacin was particularly active against tetracycline-susceptible as well as resistant strains of M. hominis (MICs, 0.06 micrograms/ml) and U. urealyticum (MICs 0.125-1 micrograms/ml). Because of this in vitro activity and its tissue distribution, sparfloxacin might be a valuable therapeutic agent for treating major bacterial sexually transmitted diseases.
TI  - [The use of the direct method for the diagnosis of Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis].
AB  - A study was carried out on 200 patients divided in two groups of 100, labeled 1 and 2. They underwent vaginal secretion tests by the direct method in order to assess its appropriateness for Gardnerella vaginalis presumptive diagnosis. This study was related with patients' symptoms, such as leukorrhea and fetidity prevailing in Group 1 and lower abdomen pain prevailing in Group 2, as well as the proportions of germs isolated and the association with this symptom for defining the microorganism role in the occurrence of so-called unspecific vaginitis; Group 1 had 100% of positive plates and Group 2 had 55%, who were given adequate treatment for the couple with further confirmation of the results which were effective in 96.7% of the cases. No relation could be seen between IUD and the presence of germ, since it is likely that its existence was not taken into account on inserting IUD.

TI  - Emergency cervical cerclage.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of emergency cervical cerclage. DESIGN: Retrospective review of patients who underwent emergency cervical cerclage between August 1986 and August 1989. SETTING: University College and the Middlesex Hospitals obstetric unit, a neonatal referral centre. SUBJECTS: 19 women between 16 and 28 weeks gestation with a cervical dilatation between 3 and 10 cm. There were two twin pregnancies. INTERVENTIONS: Amniocentesis and bacteriological assessments were performed prior to cerclage and prophylactic antibiotics were given. Insertion of sutures was aided by a combination of techniques described previously. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prolongation of gestation and pregnancy outcome. Bacteriological findings at delivery and maternal and fetal morbidity were also recorded. RESULTS: Membranes remained intact in all the women after cerclage. Fifteen live babies were born and 13 of them survived (survival rate 63%). Gestation was prolonged from between 1 and 19 weeks in these patients and the gestational age at delivery ranged from 25 to 41 weeks. All eight intrauterine or neonatal deaths were associated with infection. Infecting organisms included Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Fusobacterium spp. Pregnancy was prolonged for less than or equal to 5 weeks in these infected pregnancies. A cervical laceration occurred in a patient who had the suture inserted at full dilatation and subsequently laboured, but there were no other maternal complications. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency cervical cerclage can prolong pregnancy and influence the outcome favourably.
TI  - The susceptibility of organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis to spermicidal compounds, in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a prevalent vaginal infection that is now regarded as a risk factor in more serious pelvic and obstetric complications. Spermicides are known to have antimicrobial activity against other sexually transmitted diseases and the aim of this study was to test whether the causative organisms of BV were also susceptible to spermicides, in vitro. DESIGN: Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations of five spermicidal compounds were determined for the organisms associated with BV, in an agar dilution technique. LOCATION: The Department of Experimental and Clinical Microbiology, University of Sheffield Medical School, UK. SPERMICIDES AND ORGANISMS: Nonoxynol-9, Nonoxynol-11, Docusate sodium, Benzalkonium chloride and Menfegol were tested against 20 strains each of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and Mobiluncus organisms, isolated from patients with BV who attended the Department of Genitourinary Medicine, the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The susceptibility of BV-associated organisms to spermicidal compounds, in vitro. RESULTS: G vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp, Bacteroides bivius and Bacteroides disiens were all susceptible to the five spermicides tested, with MICs ranging between less than or equal to 19 and 5000 mg/l (0.0019%-0.5%). CONCLUSION: The concentrations of spermicides incorporated in contraceptive preparations are usually between 3% and 8%, which are far in excess of the MICs found for BV organisms. Their usage could exert a significant antimicrobial effect and be a useful prophylactic in preventing the infection.
TI  - Nonoxynol-9: differential antibacterial activity and enhancement of bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - The antibacterial activity and adherence-enhancing effects of nonoxynol-9 were evaluated against vaginal and uropathogenic bacteria. Nonoxynol-9 was markedly less active against the 43 uropathogenic bacterial and yeast strains tested (MIC90, greater than 32%) than against the 26 Gardnerella vaginalis strains (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.015%) and the 53 Lactobacillus strains (MIC90, 8%) tested. Hydrogen peroxide-producing strains of Lactobacillus were more susceptible to nonoxynol-9 (MIC90, 4%) than nonproducers (MIC90, 16%). Two Escherichia coli strains that expressed type 1 fimbriae and three vaginal strains of lactobacilli adhered in significantly higher numbers to vaginal epithelial cells preincubated with 5% nonoxynol-9 than to control cells preincubated with PBS. Spermicides may provide a selective advantage in colonizing the vagina with nonoxynol-9-resistant uropathogens such as E. coli, perhaps via a reduction in vaginal lactobacilli (especially hydrogen peroxide-producing strains) and through enhancement of adherence of E. coli to epithelial cells.
TI  - The vaginal ecosystem.
AB  - The ecology of vaginal flora is highly susceptible to numerous endogenous and exogenous influences. Possible mechanisms that might influence changes in the vaginal flora are microbial antibiosis, adhesion to the vaginal epithelial lining, e.g., availability of receptors, hormonal changes including physiologic alterations, disease states, drug therapy, sexual activity, and to a lesser extent, the immunologic status of the person. The role that these mechanisms may play in promoting vaginitis, vaginosis, and possibly pelvic inflammatory disease is explored.
TI  - Clinical significance of hyperkeratosis on otherwise normal Papanicolaou smears.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although hyperkeratosis is a common cytological finding on Papanicolaou smear, its clinical significance is unclear. METHODS: A profile of patients with hyperkeratosis was constructed by comparing them to an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. The clinical significance of hyperkeratosis was evaluated and appropriate follow-up studies were recommended. RESULTS: Of 2198 Papanicolaou smears done in the University of Kansas Family Practice Department between October 1, 1988, and October 31, 1989, there were 184 diagnoses of hyperkeratosis from smears on which no other pathological findings were noted. Charts of 183 of these patients with hyperkeratosis were reviewed and compared with an age-matched control population having normal Papanicolaou smears. Patients with hyperkeratosis had a statistically higher incidence of infections with Gardnerella vaginalis, but a lower incidence of infections with Chlamydia trachomatis. Diaphragm use was more prevalent in the group with hyperkeratosis. The incidence of inflammation on Papanicolaou smear was similar between the two groups. Of the patients with hyperkeratosis, colposcopic examination had been performed on 48% (88 of 183), of which 28% (25 of 88) had evidence of human papillomavirus or dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Review of the data obtained suggests that follow-up colposcopy, including endocervical curettage, be performed on all patients with hyperkeratosis in order to screen for accompanying pathological conditions that may necessitate treatment.
TI  - Microbiological study of vaginal discharge associated with the use of CuT 200.
AB  - A microbiological study of the vaginal discharge was conducted on 75 women attending family planning outdoors. In 24 out of 25 symptomatic CuT 200 users suffering from non-specific vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from 19 cases (79%). The difference in the recovery rate of Gardnerella vaginalis was highly significant between symptomatic CuT 200 users and non-users (p less than 0.001) and that between symptomatic and asymptomatic CuT 200 users (p less than 0.05). But the difference between asymptomatic CuT 200 users and non-users was not statistically significant. The presence of clue cells on direct Gram's staining of vaginal discharge is significantly (p less than 0.05) related to the recovery of Gardnerella vaginalis on culture.
TI  - Protein-kinase-C-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin E2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  - Certain bacterial species, of which we selected Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. The release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin E2. Bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the case of P. acnes. Furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin E2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. It is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [Ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. Changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to F. nucleatum (Gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while P. anaerobius (Gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. In both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred independently of protein kinase C, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. These results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase C and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+].

TI  - A comparison of the in-vitro activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, with erythromycin and other oral agents.
AB  - On the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations clarithromycin (6-O-methylerythromycin), a new macrolide, was found to be slightly more active than erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci. Moraxella catarrhalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) and B. ureolyticus and slightly less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter coli/jejuni and the B. melaninogenicus/oralis groups. There was complete cross-resistance between the two agents. Reports of potentiation of the activity against Haemophilus influenzae of clarithromycin by its own metabolite and by human serum appear to operate in vivo, and therefore the new agent shows great promise, especially for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Direct Gram's stain of vaginal discharge as a means of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) by direct gram-stained smear of vaginal discharge was evaluated in 90 consecutive patients. Vaginal secretions from 20 healthy female volunteers were also examined. All specimens were examined by culture for growth of Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus spp. Only 35 (38.9%) of the patients with vaginal discharge satisfied the clinical diagnosis of BV. The vaginal gram-stained smear from all these 35 patients contained typical gardnerella morphotypes characteristic of BV and G. vaginalis was isolated from all of them as well as from a further 10 patients who did not satisfy the criteria for diagnosis of BV. The semi-quantitative assessment of gardnerella morphotypes was found to correlate positively with the semi-quantitative assessment of G. vaginalis growth by culture (p less than 0.0001). There was a strong inverse relationship between the quantity of lactobacillus and gardnerella morphotypes. Direct gram-staining of smears should facilitate the diagnosis of BV for clinicians with minimum need for confirmation by culture, particularly in a third world setting with few or no laboratory facilities.
TI  - Antibiosis between bacteria isolated from the vagina of women with and without signs of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Lactobacilli from women with and without bacterial vaginosis (BV) were tested for H2O2 production. Thirty-seven (79%) of the 47 strains of lactobacilli isolated from the women without BV produced H2O2, while only nine (23%) of the 39 strains of lactobacilli obtained from women with BV did so. Five of 20 H2O2-producing and two of 26 non-producing strains of Lactobacillus exhibited antibiosis against four of 12 strains of peptostreptococci and two of 10 strains of Mobiluncus spp. None of a further 41 different anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial strains were inhibited by any of the isolates of lactobacilli tested. Some strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteriodes spp., Mobiluncus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. inhibited the growth of three strains of lactobacilli belonging to different species. When the pH of the culture medium was increased from 6.0 to 6.5 this led to a decrease in the number of strains inhibited and/or the size of the growth-inhibitory zones. Different concentrations of H2O2 did not inhibit any of the strains tested. The growth-inhibitory effect of lactobacilli could not be related to their bacteriocin production. Increasing the iron content of the medium by adding FeCl3 (0.01 mM-1 mM) decreased or completely abolished the antibiosis.
TI  - Chorionic villus sampling: analysis of fetal losses to delivery, placental pathology, and cervical microbiology.
AB  - A population of 1639 patients were seen for chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Embryonic death was identified at ultrasound in 5.3 per cent of patients. The number of patients undergoing CVS was 1551, with 1416 transcervical procedures and 135 transabdominal procedures. The most common indication for CVS was advanced maternal age. Spontaneous pregnancy losses identified by increased risk of pregnancy loss with increasing aspiration attempts. The total fetal loss for this population was 5.4 per cent with the pregnancy loss estimated due to procedure being 1.2 per cent. Analysis of placentae from patients having CVS and amniocentesis showed no differences. Microbiological assessment prior to CVS was similar to previous publications.
TI  - Control of the microbial flora of the vagina by H2O2-generating lactobacilli.
AB  - H2O2-generating lactobacilli (LB+) are present in the vagina of most normal women but are absent from most women with bacterial vaginosis (BV). LB+ at high concentration was toxic to Gardnerella vaginalis (the predominant organism in the vagina of women with BV); when the LB+ was lowered to a level where it was ineffective alone, the addition of myeloperoxidase and chloride reinstituted toxicity. Toxicity was inhibited by catalase and was not seen when H2O2-negative lactobacilli were used, implicating H2O2 as the toxic molecule. LB+ could be replaced by H2O2 and chloride by iodide, bromide, or thiocyanate. The optimum pH for inhibition of G. vaginalis was 5.0-6.0 LB+ also was autoinhibitory when combined with myeloperoxidase and chloride. LB+ alone at low concentrations was toxic to Bacteroides bivius through the formation of H2O2. Adequate amounts of peroxidase were found in the vagina of 17 of 21 women. These findings suggest that LB+ may contribute to the control of the vaginal flora, particularly in the presence of peroxidase and a halide.
TI  - Voltage-dependent cationic channels formed by a cytolytic toxin produced by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - A cytolytic toxin produced by G. vaginalis was incorporated in artificial membranes and giant liposomes. The toxin formed ionic channels when incorporated in lipid bilayers. The electrical properties of such channels were studied. Current records revealed a unitary conductance of 126 pS (in symmetrical 150 mM KCl). The open state probability of the cytolysin formed channels was a function of the applied membrane potential. The permeability ratio of cations to anions was estimated to be 6.5.
TI  - The characterization of Gardnerella vaginalis DNA using non-radioactive DNA probes.
AB  - DNA restriction profiles of various Gardnerella vaginalis isolates, generated by  BamHI, EcoRI, PstI and other restriction enzymes, varied considerably. Only a few DNA fragments were identified as common in ethidium bromide fluorescence profile and Southern-blot hybridization patterns (employing a digoxigenin-labelled G. vaginalis DNA probe and an enzyme-linked immunoassay detection method). While the efficiencies of Southern-blot hybridization appeared inconsistent, in dot-blot assays, DNA from each isolate hybridized readily, enabling the detection of at least 10 ng DNA. A 5.7-kb DNA fragment from G. vaginalis ATCC 14018 genomic library, cloned in the BamHI site of pBR322, could replace the total genomic DNA probe. This specific DNA fragment was present in different sizes in 12 analysed G. vaginalis strains, describing a restriction fragment length polymorphism. In control studies, none of the DNA from bacteria other than G. vaginalis (including some genitourinary tract residents) hybridized with the G. vaginalis total or specific DNA probes. Non-radioactive G. vaginalis DNA probes can thus form the basis of a useful detection method for further studies of this organism.
TI  - The comparison of the efficacy among three different nimorazole regimens in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - The efficacy of 3 different nimorazole regimens in treating bacterial vaginosis in women was evaluated. The regimens consisted of: Nimorazole 2 g single dose (Group I), 1 g per day for 3 days (Group II), and 1 g per day for 7 days (Group III) orally. In a simple randomized trial of 90 cases (30 cases in each group) with demonstrated clinical bacterial vaginosis on the presence of 3 of 5 of the following signs: (1) Characteristic thin homogenous discharge; (2) vaginal pH greater than 4.5; (3) release of a fishy amine odor from vaginal fluid mixed with 10% KOH; (4) presence of clue cells (usually representing at least 20% of vaginal epithelial cells); and (5) vaginal fluid contains few or no lactobacilli. Cure rates for bacterial vaginosis by nimorazole were 70.0% (21/30), 83.3% (25/30), and 90.0% (27/30) in Group I, II, and III, respectively. Thus nimorazole is another effective drug for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Characterization of Gardnerella vaginalis and G. vaginalis-like organisms from the reproductive tract of the mare.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis has been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis, from the genital tracts of asymptomatic women, and from several other infected body sites in humans. However, until recently, it has not been isolated from any other animal species. Between June 1988 and October 1989, 31 isolates identified as G. vaginalis and 70 isolates identified as G. vaginalis-like organisms have been recovered from the genital tracts of 93 mares from Michigan and Ohio. Identification was based on biochemical reactions, hemolysis on media containing blood from various animal sources, and susceptibility to select antimicrobial agents. This report details the characterization of G. vaginalis and G. vaginalis-like organism isolates obtained from the reproductive tracts of these mares and compares the equine isolates with human isolates.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of temafloxacin compared with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Temafloxacin, like other 4-quinolones, was highly active against most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. It was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin but approximately as active as ofloxacin and enoxacin. It was the most active of the quinolones against Acinetobacter spp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia but was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas spp. Temafloxacin was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and was the most active of the quinolones against Gardnerella vaginalis and Campylobacter coli/jejuni. It was more active than ciprofloxacin against most staphylococci and equally active against streptococci and enterococci. Temafloxacin was the most active quinolone against anaerobic bacteria and, with the exception of a few isolates of Bacteroides spp. and some clostridia, all anaerobes were within the sensitive range (MIC less than or equal to 2 mg/l).
TI  - Vaginal infection and preterm labour.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the vaginal flora of women in preterm labour (PTL) and determine whether the presence of specific vaginal microflora is significantly associated with onset of PTL. DESIGN: A comprehensive prospective study of the vaginal microflora of women in early labour comparing women in PTL with term controls. Microbiological assessment included cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, genital mycoplasmas and Trichomonas vaginalis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for confounding obstetric and demographic variables. SETTING: The Queen Victoria Hospital, Adelaide. PATIENTS: 428 Women in PTL compared to 568 women in labour at term. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: PTL and preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) in relation to specific vaginal microflora. RESULTS: After multiple logistic regression analysis, two distinct bacteriological groupings were associated with PTL less than 37 weeks gestation, namely, the bacterial vaginosis group of organisms, Gardnerella vaginalis and Bacteroides spp., and a group of enteropharyngeal organisms, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus spp. and S. aureus. G. vaginalis was found in 12% of women in PTL compared to 6% at term [regression odds ratio (ROR) 1.8, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.1-3.1] whereas Bacteroides spp. were detected in 45% of women in PTL compared with 35% at term (ROR 1.6, CI 1.2-2.1). The prevalence of G. vaginalis (17%) and Bacteroides spp. (50%) was even higher in women in PTL less than 34 weeks gestation. The enteropharyngeal group of organisms were more commonly present in women in PTL less than 37 weeks (E. coli 10% vs 6%, ROR 1.4, CI 0.8-2.4; Klebsiella spp. 3% vs less than 1%, ROR 5.4, CI 1.1-26.7; Haemophilus spp. 2% vs less than 1%, ROR 5.5, CI 1.1-28.6; S. aureus 6% vs 4%, ROR 1.8, CI 0.9-3.3) and were isolated even more frequently in women in PTL less than 34 weeks (E. coli 15%; Klebsiella spp. 4%; S. aureus 7%). Bacteroides spp., Klebsiella spp., and Haemophilus spp. were all found to be associated with PPROM. CONCLUSION: There are two distinct bacteriological groupings commonly found in women in PTL, especially in PTL less than 34 weeks gestation. These bacteriological groups are women with bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and women who demonstrate enteropharyngeal bacteria in the vagina.
TI  - Susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  - Fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. Two hundred thirty-one patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90% of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis were 4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates of Escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of Bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of Proteus mirabilis 0.25 and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of Lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. In summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. Anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  - [Age and sex distribution of sexually transmitted diseases in Valladolid. A study of 5076 cases].
AB  - The age and sex distribution of 5,076 cases of S.T.D. dealt with between 1982 and 1988 at the Dermatological Dispensary of the Territorial Social Welfare Service in Valladolid are studied. The maximum frequency of S.T.D. (24.1% of cases) corresponded to the age group between 21 and 25 years, which was also the period for maximum prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26.3%), Gardnerella vaginalis (30.7%), Candida albicans (27.4%) and acuminata condyloma (33.4%). Syphilis (19.9%), Chlamydia trachomatis (27%), Ureaplasma urealyticum (24.6%), Mycoplasma hominis (25.0%), Trichomonas vaginalis (23.0%) and genital herpes had maximum prevalence in the group between 26 and 30 years. Women were affected at younger ages than males. 16.9% of women with some S.T.D. were between 16 and 20 years of age, while only 6.5% of males with S.T.D. were in this age-group (p less than 0.001).
TI  - Pelvic inflammatory disease: guidelines for prevention and management.
AB  - This report provides comprehensive guidelines to aid practitioners and decision makers in achieving PID prevention and management objectives. The main focus of this document is PID related to STD. These guidelines for the prevention and management of PID were established by staff of CDC in consultation with a group of outside experts. Current data regarding the efficacy of prevention strategies and management approaches form the basis for the guidelines. Because data are incomplete, however, certain aspects of these guidelines represent the current consensus judgment of the consulted experts. Recommendations in this document should be considered a source of guidance to health practitioners.
TI  - Prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogens among women attending a methadone clinic in Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogens in drug-addicted women in Tel Aviv, Israel. DESIGN: A prospective study conducted between March and July 1987. SETTING: A methadone clinic in Tel Aviv, Israel. SUBJECTS: Sixty four asymptomatic female drug addicts were studied; 38 of them were declared practising prostitutes. METHODS: Cervical specimens were obtained for cultures, and blood samples were drawn for serological tests. Demographic data and sexual histories were obtained using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in the cervix of 25% of women; 98% had antibody titres (greater than 1:64). Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated in 57% and 65% respectively. Gardnerella vaginalis was detected in 17% of women, and herpes simplex virus was cultured from two prostitutes. Five per cent of women were carriers of HBsAg, while 57% had HBSs and/or HBc antibodies. Only one prostitute had specific treponemal antibodies. In no case were gonococci or group B streptococci isolated, and HIV serology was invariably negative. CONCLUSION: Chlamydia and genital mycoplasmas appear to be the prevailing pathogens in Israeli drug-addicted women, while gonococci and Treponema pallidum occur only rarely.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic features of urethritis in men in Toulouse, France.
AB  - On hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in Toulouse, France, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. The following incidences were found: Neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); Chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); Ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); Gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); Streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); Candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and Trichomonas vaginalis: 4 (1.8%). The prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. No pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). Mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). Another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation to clinical findings. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (P less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (PMN/HPF) (P less than .001). G. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (P less than .05) and in men with less than five PMN/HPF (P less than .05). Isolation of C. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (P less than .05) and balanitis (P less than .001). Like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. In contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates in the management of urethritis in men.
TI  - Molecular probe for identification of Trichomonas vaginalis DNA.
AB  - Trichomoniasis is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases in the world. Diagnosis can be achieved by several methods, such as direct microscopic observation of vaginal discharge, cell culture, and immunological techniques. A 2.3-kb Trichomonas vaginalis DNA fragment present in strains from diverse geographic areas was cloned and used as a probe to detect T. vaginalis DNA in vaginal discharge by a dot blot hybridization technique. This probe was specific for T. vaginalis DNA. It recognized strains from two regions in Italy (Sardinia, Piemonte) and from Mozambique (Africa). In addition, our probe did not cross-react with bacterial (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Lactobacillus spp.), viral (herpes simplex virus type 2), fungal (Candida albicans), protozoan (Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Plasmodium falciparum, Leishmania major, and Leishmania infantum), or human nucleic acids. The probe reacted with Pentatrichomonas hominis and Trichomonas foetus. The limit signal recognized by our probe corresponded to the DNA of 200 T. vaginalis isolates. The 2.3-kb probe was used in a clinical analysis of 98 samples. Of these, 20 samples were found to be positive both with the probe and by cell culture, and only 14 of these were positive by a standard wet mount method.
TI  - [The value of Gardnerella-vaginalis-culture in bacterial-vaginitis- score-confirmed bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - The relative value of a semiquantitative Gardnerella vaginalis culture for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) was studied in 113 women attending a STD clinic. The standard diagnosis of BV was based on the BV score, which is a 10-point grading system to evaluate gram-stained vaginal samples objectively and reproducibly. The sensitivity of G. vaginalis culture for the diagnosis of BV was 28%, while the specificity was 89%. The positive and the negative predictive values were 50% and 76% for G. vaginalis culture in our population. Our data suggest that G. vaginalis culture cannot be recommended for the routine diagnosis of BV. However, G. vaginalis culture will detect asymptomatic women with high vaginal colonization with G. vaginalis. Further studies are needed to find whether these women are at risk of developing BV.
TI  - The prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans in the cytology clinic at Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - In a study of 2224 adult women from the cytology clinic of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria, the prevalence of 'specific vaginal infection' (i.e. Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans) was 14.5%. For individual organisms, the rates were 9.76% for G. vaginalis, 2.52% for T. vaginalis and 2.20% for C. albicans. About half of the patients were asymptomatic while others were referred from other clinics with vaginal discharge, cervical erosion, post-coital bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding and various other symptoms and signs. The infections were almost uniformly distributed in all age groups studied. Increasing promiscuity either as a result of increased mobility of husbands (due to economic depression) or increased use of contraception by older women was thought to be responsible for the persistence of these infections in those aged 45 years and above. In addition, Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans infections can also be easily diagnosed from cervical cytology, by identification either of the organism or of characteristic cytological cellular changes.
TI  - Prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  - Media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. The bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were Group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhea, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum. Overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. A similar pattern of results was obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. In all experiments interleukin 1 beta consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. It is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. Furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  - Phospholipase C activity in microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  - Phospholipase C (lecithinase or phosphatidylcholine phosphorylase) catalyzes the  hydrolysis of lecithin into phosphorylcholine and 1,2-diglyceride. Bacterial production of phospholipase C may damage reproductive tract tissues by both direct and indirect mechanisms. Use of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phospholipase C activity was determined in 204 isolates representative of those found in female genital tract. Multiple aerobic (28%) and anaerobic (28%) reproductive tract microorganisms showed phospholipase C activity. Phospholipase C-producing isolates included strains of Bacteroides fragilis, B. bivius, B. thetaiotaomicron, Gardnerella vaginalis, and group B streptococcus. Phospholipase C activity was heterogenous; not all isolates that belong to a particular species showed activity. Phospholipase C production may be a possible virulence factor produced by a number of microflora commonly implicated in various reproductive tract infections or conditions, as well as in some instances of preterm birth.
TI  - Survival of Gardnerella vaginalis in human urine.
AB  - The authors studied the survival of Gardnerella vaginalis in human urine and determined conditions for optimum recovery on agar media. Gardnerella counts declined by greater than 99.9% in urine held at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, whereas the falloff was negligible at 4 degrees C. Viability was lost after 6 hours in urine with pH of 5, and only 0.01% cells survived in urine with pH of 7. In contrast, greater than 90% cells survived exposure at pH of 6. Dialysis to remove small molecular weight (less than 14,000) inhibitors did not enhance survival. Co-cultivation with Ureaplasma urealyticum and the addition of glycogen improved survival. Maximum recovery from urine required anaerobic incubation on enriched agar medium (pH 6.5-7.5) for at least 48 hours. Gardnerella vaginalis survives poorly in human urine at 37 degrees C. Culture for these bacteria requires prolonged anaerobic incubation.
TI  - Microbiological, epidemiological and clinical correlates of vaginal colonisation  by Mobiluncus species.
AB  - The microbiological and epidemiological correlates of vaginal colonisation by Mobiluncus species were examined among randomly selected women attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic. Women positive for Trichomonas vaginalis were excluded. Mobiluncus spp. were detected by Gram stained vaginal smear in 21% of 633 STD clinic patients, including 53% of those with and 4% of those without bacterial vaginosis (BV), as diagnosed by clinical criteria. Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis detected by vaginal culture and Mobiluncus detected by vaginal Gram stain were each independently associated with BV after adjusting by logistic regression for the presence of sexually transmitted disease pathogens, gravidity, parity and number of lifetime sexual partners (p less than 0.001 for each organism). Bacterial vaginosis was negatively correlated with isolation of lactobacilli, yeast and herpes simplex virus. After adjusting for presence or absence of BV, women with Mobiluncus were more likely to harbour G vaginalis (odds ratio 5.6, 95% confidence interval 1.6-19.5), M hominis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.0-7.0) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.0) and less likely to harbour vaginal yeast (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-1.0); were more likely to be black (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-4.6), and to have been pregnant (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1); but after the adjustment for BV, vaginal colonisation by Mobiluncus was not associated with symptoms of odour, abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, or with adnexal tenderness. In summary, Mobiluncus, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis were independently associated with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and Mobiluncus was further associated with the presence of BV-associated microorganisms (M hominis and G vaginalis), N gonorrhoeae, black race, and gravidity.
TI  - Reliability of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis is improved by a standardized method of gram stain interpretation.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine intercenter variability in the interpretation of Gram-stained vaginal smears from pregnant women. The intercenter reliability of individual morphotypes identified on the vaginal smear was evaluated by comparing them with those obtained at a standard center. A new scoring system that uses the most reliable morphotypes from the vaginal smear was proposed for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. This scoring system was compared with the Spiegel criteria for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. The scoring system (0 to 10) was described as a weighted combination of the following morphotypes: lactobacilli, Gardnerella vaginalis or bacteroides (small gram-variable rods or gram-negative rods), and curved gram-variable rods. By using the Spearman rank correlation to determine intercenter variability, gram-positive cocci had poor agreement (0.23); lactobacilli (0.65), G. vaginalis (0.69), and bacteroides (0.57) had moderate agreement; and small (0.74) and curved (0.85) gram-variable rods had good agreement. The reliability of the 0 to 10 scoring system was maximized by not using gram-positive cocci, combining G. vaginalis and bacteroides morphotypes, and weighting more heavily curved gram-variable rods. For comparison with the Spiegel criteria, a score of 7 or higher was considered indicative of bacterial vaginosis. The standardized score had improved intercenter reliability (r = 0.82) compared with the Spiegel criteria (r = 0.61). The standardized score also facilitates future research concerning bacterial vaginosis because it provides gradations of the disturbance of vaginal flora which may be associated with different levels of risk for pregnancy complications.
TI  - [Cytology of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis seems to be one of the most frequent cause of vaginal diseases which may be ascending and separates a not aesthetical discharge. A pH greater than 4.5 is found, the presence of clue cells, and a positive sniff test referring to Mobiluncus. The main microorganisms causing bacterial vaginosis are Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus sp. These are anaerobic ones. Cytology is able to give a quick and sure diagnosis.
TI  - The effect of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline plus metronidazole on lower genital tract flora in patients with proven pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Alterations in the lower genital tract flora were studied during antimicrobial treatment of 36 women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Sixteen women received ciprofloxacin, and 20 received doxycycline plus metronidazole. Both regimes eradicated Chlamydia trachomatis in all cases and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in all except one in which combination treatment failed because of resistance of the organism to tetracycline. Both regimes eradicated Mycoplasma hominis in all cases, while ciprofloxacin was somewhat less effective than combination treatment against Ureaplasma urealyticum. Ciprofloxacin was less effective than combination treatment against Gardnerella vaginalis. The incidence of Candida infection increased equally in both groups, although symptoms necessitating antifungal treatment were rare.
TI  - [New bacterial microorganisms in the etiology of human infections. The genus Gardnerella].
AB  - Haemophilus vaginalis first affiliated in the bacterial systems in the genus Haemophilus, the Corynebacterium due to its morphophysiological characteristics--forms a new genus Gardnerella with only one species G. vaginalis. The bacterium is important for man's pathology, as it is responsible for the most numerous vaginitis, considered nonspecific. The paper reports synthetically the present knowledge in biology, pathogenicity, diagnosis and treatment.
TI  - Microbiology of specialized skin: the vulva.
AB  - Human vulvar skin is an example of specialized skin. This is not only true for its gross and microscopic anatomy and physiology, but also for its microbiology. To the microbiologist, the vulva consists of several distinct ecotopes. These are defined by the physical factors, especially occlusion, nutrient factors, and by the close proximity to the vagina, the urethra, and the anus, which may result in contamination with the flora typical for those sites. Of the vulva ecotopes, only the labia majora have been seriously studied. The microbial flora of the labia majora is characterized by a high density of microorganisms, as is typical for occluded areas of the body, by the presence of organisms common for intertriginous skin such as gram-negative rods, and by the carriage of organisms unique for the vulva and probably related to urethral and vaginal flora such as the nonpathogenic neisseria, lactobacilli, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Finally, the labia majora skin is a preferred site of Staphylococcus aureus carriage that can be of clinical and epidemiological relevance.
TI  - Metronidazole pessaries compared with placebo in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial from general practice, 500 mg metronidazole pessaries applied once daily for seven days were compared with placebo in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Seventy-five women completed the study. At the follow-up visit immediately after completion of treatment, none of the patients on metronidazole fulfilled the criteria for bacterial vaginosis, compared with 12 (35%) in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). Nine (22%) of the patients treated with metronidazole harboured Gardnerella vaginalis after treatments, compared with 31 (91%) in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). Symptoms had improved or disappeared in 33 (80%) on metronidazole, and in 18 (53%) on placebo therapy (p less than 0.05). Four weeks after the follow-up visit, symptoms were reported by 28% in the metronidazole group and by 44% in the placebo group (p greater than 0.05). Metronidazole pessaries are effective in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Longitudinal study of the biotypes of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant vaginal microorganism in women with bacterial vaginosis. However, this organism is also frequently isolated from women without signs or symptoms of vaginitis. Earlier studies have not revealed whether certain biotypes of G. vaginalis are more often associated with bacterial vaginosis or are more common in women who acquire bacterial vaginosis. We used a typing scheme based on tests for beta-galactosidase, hippurate hydrolysis, and lipase, using oleate as a substrate. Of 261 strains tested, the distribution of biotypes observed was as follows: 1, 13%; 2, 9%; 3, 5%; 4, 7%; 5, 41%; 6, 15%; and 8, 10%. Biotype 7 was not observed. The distributions of biotypes from women with and without bacterial vaginosis were found to be significantly different, with the lipase-positive biotypes (biotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4) being more predominant in women with vaginosis (41 versus 23%, P = 0.003). Of 40 women with normal vaginal flora at the index visit who remained normal at follow-up, 23 (57%) acquired a new biotype of G. vaginalis. By comparison, 90% of the 30 women who developed bacterial vaginosis acquired a new biotype of G. vaginalis (P = 0.003). Women with bacterial vaginosis at the index visit who were not treated were no more likely than normal women to have a shift in G. vaginalis biotype. However, 86% of the 30 women with bacterial vaginosis who were treated with an antibiotic at the index visit acquired a different biotype (P = 0.04 compared with the value for untreated women) regardless of treatment success. A trend toward the acquisition of a new biotype was observed among women who had contact with a new sexual partner (81 versus 65%, P = 0.15). These data demonstrate that the lipase-positive isolates of G. vaginalis are associated with bacterial vaginosis. Women who acquire bacterial vaginosis are more likely to have a shift in biotype than women who had normal flora at he follow-up, suggesting that the G. vaginalis isolates recovered from women who develop bacterial vaginosis represent newly acquired strains rather than overgrowth of previously colonizing biotypes.
TI  - A further look at infection at the time of therapeutic abortion.
AB  - Microbiological investigations and clinical follow-up were performed on 516 patients undergoing first-trimester termination of pregnancy, over a 2-year period. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated by pre-operative microbiological screening in 6.7% of patients, gonococcus in 0.4% and Trichomonas vaginalis in 2%. Candida spp and Gardnerella vaginalis were isolated from 16% and 28% of the women, respectively. Patients who had positive cervical chlamydial isolation were significantly younger (less than 22 years) than those who did not. Doctor's clinical diagnosis of genital tract infection was found to be associated with a positive screening result but not with the likelihood of postabortal pelvic infection. Among the 175 patients followed up in the outpatient clinic, 4 of the 15 patients with a positive result for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis and/or T. vaginalis developed postoperative pelvic infection, which is significantly more than the group who did not harbour any of these three organisms (9/114).
TI  - Non-specific vaginitis vis-a-vis Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - One hundred patients of vaginitis along with 50 age matched control women were studied. Non-specific vaginitis (NSV) was diagnosed on the basis of the presence of at least any three of the four parameters which included presence of thin gray homogeneous discharge, pH of the discharge greater than or equal to 4.5, liberation of fishy odour from the discharge after adding 10 per cent KOH and presence of clue cells Using these criteria, NSV was diagnosed in 22 of the 100 patients and in 4 of 50 control women. Gardnerella vaginalis was cultured from 23 of the 26 women with NSV and 19 women without NSV (8 patients and 11 normal women). Women with NSV showed statistically significant difference in the presence of clue cells, amine test positivity and concentration of G. vaginalis as compared to women without NSV.
TI  - A rapid DNA isolation procedure from petri dish grown clinical bacterial isolates.

TI  - [Intravaginal bacterial flora in patients with uterine cervical cancer, with special reference to Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - In a total of 18 subjects, comprising 16 cases of uterine cervical cancer (4 cases, stage Ib; 1 case, stage IIa; 11 cases, stage IIb) and 2 cases of cervical dysplasia, the intravaginal bacterial floras, including Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis) and Mobiluncus spp., were investigated. In uterine cervical cancer, there were mixed bacterial flora of aerobes and anaerobes but what is of note is that G. vaginalis was detected in 7 out of 16 cases of uterine cervical cancer and in 1 out of 2 cases of dysplasia. The number of G. vaginalis present was far greater than that of the other coexisting species. In contrast, none of the Mobiluncus spp. was detected. Since G. vaginalis was detected at a high incidence in uterine cervical cancer and dysplasia, the possibility of a relationship between G. vaginalis and uterine cervical cancer was suggested.
TI  - Identification and partial characterization of a cytolytic toxin produced by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Generation and release into the culture medium of a cytolytic toxin by Gardnerella vaginalis has been demonstrated. Addition of starch and of the nonionic detergent Tween 80 to the culture medium was essential to recover cytolytic activity. A protein with an apparent molecular mass of 61 to 63 kDa was purified from the culture supernatants showing lytic activity towards erythrocytes and nucleated cells, such as human endothelial cells and human neutrophils. The protein had marked selectivity for human erythrocytes, while erythrocytes from other species were not lysed or were lysed at much higher concentrations of the protein than those needed for human erythrocytes. The cytolytic activity was remarkably unstable in polar media, but was stabilized by nonionic detergents, by binding, or by insertion into the target cell membrane, suggesting its amphiphilic nature.
TI  - Psychosocial aspects of chronic, clinically unconfirmed vulvovaginitis.
AB  - Women with chronic symptoms of vulvovaginitis referred to a university vulvovaginitis clinic were assessed on psychological and social (including sexual) variables to determine whether differences existed among women with unconfirmed vulvovaginitis, women with confirmed vulvovaginitis, and healthy controls. Eighty-three consecutive women with chronic symptoms of vulvovaginitis and 32 asymptomatic control women completed clinical examinations, cultures, and the following psychological tests or questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, a sexual behavior and response questionnaire (Campion), and a study questionnaire. Statistical analyses (chi 2 and analysis of variance) were performed on the confirmed and unconfirmed vulvovaginitis and control groups of women. Women with confirmed and unconfirmed vulvovaginitis scored higher than control women on several psychological variables, but women with unconfirmed vulvovaginitis were found to be significantly more emotionally distressed on psychological tests and to report more discomfort during sexual intercourse than both women with confirmed vulvovaginitis and healthy controls. Psychosocial inquiry is important in the clinical assessment and management of such women.
TI  - The detection of Gardnerella vaginalis DNA sequences in uncultured clinical specimens with cloned G. vaginalis DNA as probes.
AB  - Cloned Gardnerella vaginalis DNA were selected from a plasmid DNA library constructed with partially restriction endonuclease Hind III-digested genomic DNA of G. vaginalis to serve as DNA probe in detecting G. vaginalis. The level of detection was determined to be approximately 10,000 cells by slot-blot DNA hybridization. This probe DNA will not cross-hybridize with DNA of a number of non-Gardnerella micro-organisms commonly found in female genital tract. The DNA probe-based hybridization test may become a useful tool for the identification of G. vaginalis in uncultured clinical specimens.
TI  - Vaginitis emphysematosa. A report of four cases.
AB  - It has been hypothesized that vaginitis emphysematosa is a manifestation of trichomonal or Gardnerella infection. In support of this etiologic concept, four cases of the disorder are described showing the apparent curative effect of treating the associated infection. The linkage of these and other reported cases with conditions of impaired immunity suggests that immunologic factors are involved in the pathogenesis.
TI  - Vaginitis. Systematically solving a bothersome problem.
AB  - Vaginitis is a common cause of patient visits to primary care physicians. Causes  include allergic and irritative factors and infectious agents. Diagnosis is readily made with use of simple office procedures such as wet smears, stains, and cultures. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics or vaginal preparations is usually effective.
TI  - Enumeration of clue cells in rehydrated air-dried vaginal wet smears for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Among 235 women attending an outpatient clinic, the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was made using three of the following four criteria: typical discharge, pH more than 4.5, positive amine sniff test, and clue cells in a wet smear. These findings were correlated with the finding of clue cells in air-dried wet smears rehydrated more than 1 month after the visit. The rehydrated specimens had the same microscopic appearance as a nonpreserved wet smear. The demonstration of clue cells in the rehydrated smears correlated with the composite diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 98%. In a busy multi-physician setting, the scoring of clue cells in stored and rehydrated smears can be used to obtain consistent readings for wet-smear diagnostics, thus simplifying teaching and increasing the utility of wet smears in clinical research.
TI  - Evaluation of the Gram stain as a screening tool for maternal carriage of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci. The Vaginal Infections and Prematurity Study Group.
AB  - To determine the usefulness of the vaginal Gram stain as a screen for maternal group B streptococcal carriage, we compared the presence of gram-positive cocci on Gram stain with a cervicovaginal culture in 7755 women at 23-26 weeks' gestation and in 1452 women at delivery. Group B streptococci were isolated from 18.4% of women at 23-26 weeks and 14.9% of women at delivery. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Gram stain were 28, 69, 17, and 81%, respectively, in mid-gestation and 34, 72, 18, and 86%, respectively, at delivery. The presence of gram-positive cocci on Gram stain was strongly associated with the isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis and with the presence of bacterial vaginosis. We conclude that most gram-positive cocci seen on Gram stain are probably anaerobes or micrococci and that the vaginal Gram stain is neither sensitive nor specific enough to be of use as a tool in the diagnosis of maternal group B streptococcal carriage.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis vaginitis are risk factors for cuff cellulitis after abdominal hysterectomy.
AB  - To assess the relationship between either bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis vaginitis and posthysterectomy infection, preoperative evaluation of the vaginal secretions was performed in 161 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. Thirty-two patients (19.9%) and 27 patients (16.8%), respectively, met the diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis vaginitis. Patients with either bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis vaginitis were more likely than control subjects to have cuff cellulitis, cuff abscess, or both (relative risk 3.2, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 6.7 for bacterial vaginosis; relative risk 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 7.1 for trichomoniasis vaginitis). Preoperative vaginitis had no effect with respect to the incidence of postoperative wound infection, urinary tract infection, or intravenous line phlebitis. Bacteroides sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., and/or Gardnerella vaginalis ("bacterial vaginosis organisms") were isolated from the vaginal cuff in the majority of patients with postoperative cuff cellulitis. Bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis vaginitis are risk factors for the development of posthysterectomy cuff cellulitis.
TI  - Microbiologic efficacy of intravaginal clindamycin cream for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by replacement of the normal Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora with Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and Mycoplasma hominis. The present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. Sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. Quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. At enrollment, G vaginalis was recovered from 99%, Bacteroides sp from 94%, Peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and M hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. The vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. The mean log concentration was 1.2 X 10(9) cfu/mL for aerobic and 2.6 X 10(8) cfu/mL for anaerobic bacteria. After treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for G vaginalis, Bacteroides sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, and M hominis. The 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. Treatment with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. Therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of Lactobacillus, and a probably transient increase in the frequency of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Vaginitis and vaginosis].
AB  - Recently, within the wide subject on vaginal phlogosis a new pathology has been included. Owing to its peculiar characteristics, as it is not to be regarded as a vaginitis in the strict sense of the word, it has been identified as anaerobic bacterial vaginosis. The latter proves to be different from most common vaginitis related pathologies as a result of a series of microbiological and clinical patterns that are widely dealt with in this research. Moreover, the author place special emphasis on the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of vaginosis.
TI  - Incidence of Gardnerella vaginalis infection in pregnant & non-pregnant women with non-specific vaginitis.
AB  - The occurrence of G. vaginalis in patients with non-specific vaginitis (NSV) was  studied. Of the 200 women with vaginitis screened, 84 were diagnosed to have non-specific vaginitis. G. vaginalis was isolated from 33 (39.28%) patients either alone or in combination with other organisms, while one of the healthy controls with no vaginal discharge yielded G. vaginalis on culture. The nature of vaginal discharge could not be correlated with the type of infection. Clue cells and amine test gave inconsistent results in the presence of G. vaginalis infection. A varying susceptibility pattern of G. vaginalis was observed against various antimicrobials, metronidazole (95%) and gentamicin (75%) showing highest sensitivity.
TI  - Reservoir of four organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis suggests lack of  sexual transmission.
AB  - This study consisted of a search for the possible reservoir and mode of spread of the four bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms Mobiluncus mulieris, Mobiluncus curtisii, Mycoplasma hominis, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Their occurrence in rectal, oral, and pharyngeal specimens from women with and without bacterial vaginosis, their male sexual consorts, four homosexual men, and children (altogether, 374 people) was studied. Genital samples were also obtained from all adults. All four organisms were isolated from the rectums of 45 to 62% of women with bacterial vaginosis and 10 to 14% of women without bacterial vaginosis. They also occurred in the rectums of males and children. M. hominis was recovered from the oropharynxes of 12 adults whose sexual consorts had genital occurrences of the organism. Mobiluncus spp. occurred only in the vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis (97%). The organisms were only infrequently recovered from genital samples from 135 males. Organisms were recovered from the urethras and/or coronal sulci of 10 of 44 male consorts of women with bacterial vaginosis. However, after 2 weeks of condom use during sexual intercourse, only M. hominis remained in the urethra of one man. These findings suggest that the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are not spread sexually but colonize the vagina from an endogenous intestinal tract site. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to bacterial vaginosis in a subpopulation of all women are still unknown.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance in Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  - In in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of Acinetobacter spp. and Aeromonas hydrophila. They were also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. Other Pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. Both agents were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing Branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher MICs. Gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and Campylobacter coli/jejuni usually susceptible. Both antibiotics had good activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and Staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. All streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. Both antibiotics had little useful activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group or Bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. Clostridium difficile and some other Clostridium species were resistant.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. Accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis Bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in Lactobacillus sp. Excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and G. Vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal pH constitute the hallmark of diagnosis. The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. Bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. It is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. Therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. Women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. The cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. New data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. No evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: diagnostic and pathogenetic findings during topical clindamycin therapy.
AB  - We examined subjective and objective correlates among 67 women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin or placebo. We found no preponderance of any sexual practices among these patients. Nine patients (13.4%) had had hysterectomy. Whereas odor and discharge were the most common symptoms, 30 patients (44.8%) also complained of vulvovaginal irritation. Symptoms correlated poorly with objective therapeutic outcome. On examination the diagnosis would have been missed in seven patients (10.4%) if the clinician relied on presence of an abnormal vaginal discharge to suggest bacterial vaginosis. Vaginal pH greater than 4.5 was found immediately after curative therapy in 59.6% of patients. Mobiluncus spp. morphotypes were 99.0% specific and 52.1% sensitive and proline aminopeptidase activity in vaginal fluid was 84.4% sensitive and 70.2% specific for diagnosis. Our Gram stain criteria yielded no false-negative results, 6.1% false-positive, and frequent indeterminate results after therapy. We found little evidence for sexual transmission of bacterial vaginosis. Recurrence after effective therapy was not predicted by vaginal pH elevation, positive or indeterminate Gram stain result, or positive proline aminopeptidase test.
TI  - A follow-up study of methods of contraception, sexual activity, and rates of trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A randomized, clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the spermicidal agent nonoxynol 9 as prophylaxis for sexually transmitted diseases. Eight hundred eighteen women using birth control who attended a sexually transmitted disease clinic were evaluated monthly for trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis for 6 months. Women using the active spermicide experienced a somewhat lower incidence rate of trichomoniasis (relative rate 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.12) and bacterial vaginosis (relative rate 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.12) as compared with placebo users. The rate of candidiasis was nearly identical for spermicide and placebo users (relative rate 1.02; 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.35). The number of sexual partners during the preceding month was related directly to the occurrence of trichomoniasis (p = 0.047) and bacterial vaginosis (p = 0.009) but not candidiasis (p = 0.99). Subjects using oral contraceptives experienced a statistically significant lower rate of trichomoniasis than did women using an intrauterine contraceptive device or who had had a tubal ligation (relative rate 0.56; 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.81).
TI  - Bacteriological state of the urine in symptom-free adult males.
AB  - Mid-stream urine specimens from 120 symptom-free males aged between 15 and 60 years were examined for cells and bacteria. Only 3 specimens showed pyuria, all of which yielded fastidious organisms. No specimen yielded a pure growth of an aerobe. Fastidious organisms in pure or mixed growth were isolated from 26% of the specimens, none in a count greater than 10(8)/l and the majority in counts less than 10(7)/l. It was concluded that pure growths of aerobes in any count in patients with symptoms are indicative of infection. Fastidious organisms should be sought in the urine of patients with symptoms or pyuria before more intensive and expensive investigations are pursued.
TI  - Is candidiasis the true cause of vulvovaginal irritation in women with diabetes mellitus?
AB  - Vulvovaginitis is common in diabetic women and is often treated with antifungal agents on the assumption that the causative organism is Candida albicans. In a survey of 100 consecutive diabetic women attending a diabetes clinic 36 had complained to their general practitioner about vulvovaginal irritation during the past three years and 26 were treated with antifungal agents without a vaginal examination or swabs being taken. In a separate study 27 post-menopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes and symptoms of vulvovaginitis were investigated. The organisms cultured were: Candida albicans (n = 6), beta haemolytic streptococci (n = 14), Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus milleri (n = 1), Streptococcus faecalis (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), no organisms (n = 3). Where a bacterial organism was isolated symptoms resolved in all but one case with appropriate antibiotic treatment. It is recommended that the practice of initiating antifungal treatment without taking high vaginal swabs should be reviewed and treatment should be given specifically rather than empirically.
TI  - Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis from the reproductive tract of four mares.
AB  - A gram-variable pleomorphic bacillus was isolated from the reproductive tracts of 4 mares during routine prebreeding soundness examinations. Using a commercial bacterial identification system, these organisms were identified as Streptococcus acidominimus. However, colonial and Gram-staining characteristics did not support this identification. Subsequent testing indicated the organism was similar to Gardnerella vaginalis. Additional growth and biochemical analysis performed in our laboratory and at the Michigan Department of Public Health and by the Center for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, confirmed the identification of G. vaginalis.
TI  - Genital infections in women attending a genito-urinary clinic in Harare, Zimbabwe.
AB  - One hundred women attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in Harare were examined for presenting features and genital infections. The most common presenting symptoms were of discharge, lower abdominal pain and dysuria, and on examination signs of discharge, inflammation, haemorrhage or ulcers/erosions were noticeable in all women. Fourteen women had genital warts. Pathogens were detected in 95% of patients. Gonococcal infection occurred in 19 women, with 60% of the strains isolated being penicillinase producing. Yeasts were detected in specimens from 25 women while chlamydial infection appeared to be rare, evidence of infection being detected in only eight women. Sera from 44 women were positive by the RPR test and sera from 33 women were positive by TPHA. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from 48 women, Group B streptococci from 37 women, and Trichomonas vaginalis from 32 women.
TI  - The inflammatory cervical smear: a study in general practice.
AB  - This study set out to determine whether the term 'inflammatory' in a cervical smear report implies underlying infection or whether it could be masking cancerous or precancerous changes. Of 826 smears taken in one practice over one year, 42 demonstrated some degree of inflammatory change. Thirty four of these women presented for swabs and almost half (47%) had a microbiologically proven infection. This group was further subdivided, and of those whose smears were reported as simple 'inflammation', just over one third (35%) were infected but of those whose smears were reported as 'severe inflammation', over two thirds were infected (73%). The commonest organisms isolated were Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida albicans. It would therefore appear to be worthwhile to treat patients who report severe inflammation with metronidazole and with anti-fungal pessaries before the smear is repeated. Following treatment two women went on to show dyskaryosis within five months. On colposcopy one of these women was found to have invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma. It is concluded that whether women with inflammatory smears are treated or not, it is mandatory to repeat the smear, ideally within five months.
TI  - Survey of genitourinary organisms in a population of sexually active adolescent males admitted to a chemical dependency unit.
AB  - Sixty-two males consecutively admitted to an adolescent chemical dependency unit  for treatment over a one-year period were studied. When interviewed, all denied having urogenital symptoms. Forty-eight reported having had sexual intercourse. Of these 48, 34 were screened (urethral swab) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chylamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Eighteen of the 34 males who had complete screening were found to harbor one or more organisms: 3 had Chlamydia, 13 had Ureaplasma, and 11 had Gardnerella. In addition, 61 of the original 62 subjects were tested for serum antibodies to Treponema pallidum and for pyuria. No subjects were found to have syphilis. Pyuria was present in all subjects with Chlamydia but in only two with Ureaplasma or Gardnerella.

TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of the significance of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum in female genital tract infection--a retrospective case note study.
AB  - Routine screening for sexually transmitted diseases in new patients attending the Genitourinary Clinic in Stoke-on-Trent includes a culture for Mycoplasma hominis (MH) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU). A retrospective study was carried out on 400 female patients to ascertain whether there were any significant differences between the group positive for MH and UU and the negative control group. The positive group were found to be younger on average, but to have similar sexual histories to the negative control group. An association was found between the presence of genital mycoplasmas and Gardnerella vaginalis. An odourous vaginal discharge was more common in the positive group. Erythromycin was ineffective in eradicating the organisms in 62.5% of patients with MH, and 70% of those with UU. Continuing work is required to identify those women in whom the presence of MH or UU could have pathogenic effects. Treatment regimens for this group of women need to be carefully reassessed, in the light of increasing antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis: isolation and identification.
AB  - A total of 26 isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis were obtained from 248 patients attending the out patient department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at A.I.I.M.S hospital, over a period of one year. The vaginal discharge of these patients was cultured on five different media in order to evaluate the best medium for the growth of G. vaginalis. Media containing human blood were found to be the most suitable, Human-Blood-Bilayer medium with Tween-80 being the best for the growth of the organism. A total of 12 biochemical tests were performed for the identification of each isolate. A short and rapid scheme for identification of the organism in a routine laboratory has been evolved.
TI  - Bacteriologic findings of post-cesarean endometritis in adolescents.
AB  - Two hundred four post-cesarean adolescents were compared with 751 adults to determine whether age was a risk factor for endometritis. Adolescents had an infection rate of 23%, compared with 11% for controls (P less than .001). Length of labor, duration of ruptured membranes, and the use of an internal monitor were noted to be risk factors for endometritis in adults, but not in adolescents. Endometrial aspirates from adolescents exhibited significantly higher isolation rates of Chlamydia trachomatis (21 versus 6%, P less than .05) and Gardnerella vaginalis (32 versus 9%, P less than .005) than did those from adults. Antepartum isolation of these organisms in teenagers may help to identify those at risk for postpartum endometritis.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis in posthysterectomy infection.
AB  - Eighty-six women were admitted for abdominal hysterectomy. Preoperatively, 43 women were culture-positive for Gardnerella vaginalis from the cervical os, and 43 women were culture-negative. Postoperatively, 18 patients developed inflammation; among those 14 patients from the culture-positive group were infected, whereas only 4 patients from the culture-negative group developed inflammation. The difference between occurrence of G. vaginalis and the absence of the bacteria in patients with postoperative infection is highly significant. No such increased risk of postoperative infection was correlated to the isolation of any other microorganism looked for viz. aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, viruses or chlamydiae. G. vaginalis may play a causative role in the development of posthysterectomy infection.

TI  - The role and prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in anaerobic vaginosis.
AB  - 310 cases of anaerobic vaginosis and 80 asymptomatic females were studied for the detection of various organisms from their genital specimens. The main complaint of the symptomatic cases was vaginal discharge. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis. Bacteroides species, anaerobic cocci and Gardnerella vaginalis were detected. The frequency of detection of all except C. albicans was less in pregnant than non-pregnant women. However, the prevalence of anaerobes and G. vaginalis was significantly lower in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant than the non-pregnant women. G. vaginalis showed mutualism with anaerobic bacteria and was not isolated as a pure culture in any of the cases. It appears that G. vaginalis, like anaerobes, has variable prevalence rates and is under the influence of local physiological and hormonal factors. This organism does not appear to have a primary pathogenic role, but assumes a secondary role in association with non-sporing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of anaerobic vaginosis.
TI  - Etiology and treatment of post-cesarean-section endometritis after cephalosporin  prophylaxis.
AB  - To describe the microbiologic etiology of post-cesarean endometritis developing after perioperative cephalosporin prophylaxis, endometrial samples were obtained from 27 women with a triple-lumen catheter. The women were assigned in a double-blind, randomized fashion to receive either ticarcillin/clavulanate, 3.1 g, or cefoxitin, 2 g, administered every six hours, until the clinical signs of infection resolved. A total of 149 microorganisms (84 facultative and 65 obligate anaerobes) were recovered from 26 women, for a mean of 5.5 isolates per specimen. One endometrial specimen was sterile. Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus species were the most frequent isolates, followed by Gardnerella vaginalis, Enterococcus, facultative gram-negative rods and Mycoplasma hominis. Each of the isolates was tested for beta-lactamase activity. At least one beta-lactamase-producing isolate was recovered from 56% of the specimens. Susceptibility testing of endometrial isolates demonstrated that 96% of 118 potential pathogens (Gardnerella, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, enterococci and streptococci) were susceptible to ticarcillin/clavulanate. By comparison, 86% of these isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin in vitro. Women who were treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate were less likely to have a temperature greater than 38 degrees C for two or more days (8% vs. 57%, P = .01). Also, there was a trend toward a decreased duration of uterine tenderness in the ticarcillin/clavulanate group, but it did not attain statistical significance (60% vs. 86%, P = .4). However, the overall clinical success rate with these single-agent treatments was not different for the two groups (77% vs. 79%, P = 1.0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Characterization of the Tet M determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus ducreyi, Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Veillonella parvula had DNA sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the Tet M transposon, Tn916. In contrast, Gardnerella vaginalis, commensal Neisseria spp., and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.
TI  - Genetic basis of tetracycline resistance in urogenital bacteria.
AB  - The distributions of the nucleotide sequences related to the tetracycline resistance determinants Tet K, Tet L, Tet M, and Tet O were studied by dot blot hybridization with randomly chosen clinical urogenital tract isolates of viridans group streptococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Veillonella parvula. Among the Peptostreptococcus spp., 79% of the isolates hybridized with one (64%) or more (36%) of the probes for Tet K (27%), Tet L (30%), Tet M (75%) and Tet O (13%). Of the viridans group streptococci, 82% of the strains hybridized with one (34%) or more (66%) of the four probes. The distribution of the four determinants in this group was as follows: Tet K, 36%; Tet L, 31%; Tet M, 43%; Tet O, 61%. Twenty-nine percent of the enterococci and forty-six percent of the group B streptococci hybridized with the probes; however, the Tet K, Tet L, and Tet O determinants were found in only a few strains, while the Tet M determinant predominated. A total of 29% of the F. nucleatum isolates, 55% of the G. vaginalis isolates, and 26% of the V. parvula isolates hybridized with the Tet M determinant. In contrast, 43% of the Lactobacillus spp. hybridized with the Tet O determinant. The data indicate that tetracycline resistance determinants are common to many of the microorganisms isolated from the urogenital tract.

TI  - In-vitro studies with ramoplanin (MDL 62,198): a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial.
AB  - Ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of Actinoplanes sp. (ATCC 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl moieties and D-mannose. The in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. Ramoplanin was very active against Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. Concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. Ramoplanin was also very active against Streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, Str. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium spp. (including Cory. jeikeium), Listeria monocytogenes, Gardnerella vaginalis, Propionibacterium acnes and Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. In general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. With the exception of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against Gram-negative bacteria.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor for post-cesarean endometritis.
AB  - Bacterial species associated with bacterial vaginosis have been isolated more frequently from endometrial cultures of patients with postpartum endometritis than expected from the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women. To further assess the association between bacterial vaginosis and postpartum endometritis, vaginal Gram smears were obtained from women admitted for delivery. Vaginal smears of women delivered by cesarean were scored as normal or as indicating bacterial vaginosis. Factors related independently to postpartum endometritis by multiple logistic regression analysis included maternal age less than 25 years, any duration of membrane rupture, and bacterial vaginosis. The unadjusted odds ratio for the development of postpartum endometritis associated with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio = 6.1, 95% confidence interval 3.3-15.9) was not appreciably changed in the multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 5.8, 95% confidence interval 3.0-10.9) after adjusting for maternal age, duration of labor, and duration of membrane rupture. At the time of endometritis, Bacteroides sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, and Gardnerella vaginalis were isolated more frequently from the endometrium using a triple lumen endometrial sampling method among patients with bacterial vaginosis than among those with a normal Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis appears to be an important risk factor for postpartum endometritis after cesarean delivery.

TI  - Use of the RapID-ANA system and sodium polyanetholesulfonate disk susceptibility  testing in identifying Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi has traditionally been difficult to identify. We have utilized simple test methods to identify 19 fresh isolates obtained during a recent outbreak of chancroid in Houston and six strains of H. ducreyi from other outbreaks. Tests were performed from growth on chocolate agar after 48 h of incubation at 35 degrees C with increased humidity and CO2. All isolates exhibited typical colonial morphology and Gram stain. Isolates were catalase negative and oxidase and nitrate positive (in enriched broth). The RapID NH system failed to identify these strains because of negative reactions with alkaline phosphatase and nitrate reductase. However, by using the RapID-ANA system, all strains were positive for alkaline phosphatase and arginine, glycine, and serine aminopeptidases. Their biochemical profiles were distinct from those obtained with 66 strains representing 13 species similar to H. ducreyi. We also investigated the use of sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) disk susceptibility to identify and differentiate H. ducreyi from other species. All H. ducreyi isolates were susceptible, as evidenced by the presence of a zone of inhibition with an average size of 15 mm around the SPS disk. With the exceptions of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Capnocytophaga spp., no other strain showed any evidence of inhibition. The latter three organisms can be easily differentiated from H. ducreyi by various features including reactions in the RapID-ANA. We conclude that, by considering simple growth and biochemical characteristics, SPS susceptibilities, and reactions in RapID-ANA, it is possible for more clinical laboratories to definitively identify this organism.

Postmenopausal women showed an increased rate of asymptomatic carriage of G. vaginalis. The data suggest a relatively weak association between clinical diagnosis of NSV and isolation of G. vaginalis.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: prevalence in outpatients, association with some micro-organisms and laboratory indices.
AB  - Seven hundred and ninety three women were investigated, aged between 16 and 78 years, to evaluate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and some associated micro-organisms, and to discuss the significance of laboratory indices correlated to this pathology. BV was diagnosed on the basis of four distinct criteria: a positive result of the test for amines with 10% KOH (odour-test), the presence of clue cells on fresh microscopic examination, a pH greater than 4.5 and direct Gram stain positive (the presence of more than 40 Gram negative or Gram variable coccobacilli per microscopic field by 1000 magnifications under oil immersion). The total prevalence of BV was 20.5% (163); similar percentages were found in both fertile and pregnant women, whereas a lower percentage (12.7%) was found in menopausal women. Gardnerella vaginalis was present in 235 (29.6%) of the 793 women, in 144 (88.3%) of the 163 with BV and in 91 (14.4%) of the 630 women without BV. Mobiluncus species was present in 8.2% (65) of the total population, in 38.6% (63) of the women with BV and only in two (0.3%) of the women without BV. In the women with BV lower percentages were found for Trichomonas vaginalis, yeasts, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The absence of a definite relationship between BV and cultural isolation of G vaginalis is confirmed whereas the role played by Mobiluncus spp still has to be clarified. It is concluded that it is not necessary to screen with all four laboratory indices. Two positive indices from a panel of three (excluding pH greater than 4.5 and direct Gram stain positive in the same panel) allows the correct diagnosis of BV in almost all cases.

Trachomatis in the cervix and urethra and bacteriological examination of the cervix were performed in a material of 224 patients for legal abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Chlamydia was demonstrated in 8.9% of the patients, Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 0.5% and, in 41%, growth of Gardnerella vaginalis predominated. It proved possible to define a group at risk for the presence of Chlamydia consisting of all the patients under the age of 25 years and nulliparae aged 25-29 years. 17% in this group had positive Chlamydia tests as compared with 1.7% in the patients in other groups. Patients in the above mentioned risk group should be examined for C. trachomatis in cases of legal termination of pregnancy so that appropriate treatment can be administered prior to evacuation.
TI  - Biotypes of Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from non-specific vaginitis patients in Bombay.
AB  - The incidence and prevalent biotypes of G. vaginalis in patients with non-specific vaginitis from Bombay, was studied. Of 300 patients screened, 105 were diagnosed to have nonspecific vaginitis (NSV). G. vaginalis was isolated from 71 per cent patients with NSV; 34.6 and 29.3 per cent G. vaginalis were belonging to biotypes 5 and 1 respectively. In 55 per cent patient, G. vaginalis was associated with anaerobes. None of the isolated strains of G. vaginalis was sensitive to 5 micrograms metronidazole disc whereas 93 per cent of the strains were sensitive to 50 micrograms metronidazole disc.

TI  - [Recurrent vaginitis].
AB  - Vaginitis is one of the most frequent infections of the female genital system and, in the United States, represents the main reason for gynecological consultation. Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis are responsible for 90% of cases of vaginal phlogosis. It has been calculated that a percentage varying between 5% and 40% of the female population will suffer, at least once in their lifetime, from an episode of vaginal candidosis. The re-appearance of symptoms after suspension of the antimycotic therapy still represents an unsolved and obscure problem from the etiopathogenetic point of view. The incidence of recurrences in women suffering from various forms of vaginal candidosis, according to the Authors, is between 5% and 25%. Considering the uncertainties existing regarding the clinical and etiopathogenetic definition of recurrent vaginitis we carried out a perspective study, at the General Out-patient Department of the II Obstetrical and Gynecological Clinic of "La Sapienza" Rome University in collaboration with the Bacteriological Laboratory of the III Medical Clinic of "La Sapienza" Rome University, on a group of 60 women suffering from recurrent vaginitis. We included in the study in the period 1 October 1987 - 30 September 1988 60 women reporting to the General Out-Patient Department of the II Obstetrical and Gynecological Clinic of the "La Sapienza" Rome University. These patients complained about the appearance of a leukorrhea or a leukoxanthorrhea in combination with at least one of the following symptoms: burning sensation; itch; dyspareunia; dysuria; recurring cystitis. All the women reported in their case histories having suffered from at least three episodes of recurrent vaginal candidosis in the previous twelve months. Diagnosis had been established on the basis of fresh microscopic examination with determination of the vaginal pH on the occasion of the first episode only; whereas clinical examination only was undertaken on the occasion of the subsequent ones. In 30% of patients (or 18 cases) the diagnosis of the subsequent episodes was "telephonic". In all cases, at each episode, a local therapy with antimycotic drugs had been prescribed. Following the introduction of a sterile speculum sterile swabs were used to remove 2 samples of the fluid present at the level of the posterior vaginal fornix. The first swab was placed in a test-tube containing 2 ml of prereduced transport broth (brain-heart infusion broth oxoid) for the successive aerobe and anaerobe cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Vaginal microbial flora in women with and without vaginal discharge registered in general practice.
AB  - To compare the microbiological findings for patients with and without vaginal discharge, 29 general practitioners registered 361 women with and 229 women without complaints of vaginal discharge in a multi-practice study in the county of Aarhus, Denmark. In five of the patients (1.4%) with vaginal discharge, Neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated compared with one (0.4%) in women without vaginal discharge. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 30 (8.3%) and nine (3.9) respectively, Candida in 113 (31.3%) and 44 (19.2%), Gardnerella vaginalis in 187 (51.8%) and 93 (40.6%), and Trichomonas vaginalis in 10 (2.8%) and one (0.4%). The criteria of bacterial vaginosis were fulfilled by 129 (35.7%) women with vaginal discharge, and by 19 (8.3%) without symptoms. Except for T. vaginalis and N. gonorrhoeae, the microorganisms were significantly (p less than 0.05) more frequent among patients with than without vaginal discharge. C. trachomatis was found in 25 (11%) women under the age of 25, compared to 14 (4%) aged 25 years or older (p less than 0.01). The isolation rates of the other microorganisms were not related to age. G. vaginalis was found in high concentrations in 73% of those harbouring this bacterium. No difference in concentration was found between women with and without vaginal discharge (p less than 0.05).

TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the United Kingdom.
AB  - MICs of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. For Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than Clostridium difficile, MICs were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. The activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. Meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, with MICs in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. Staphylococci, Strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (MICs less than 4 mg/l). Enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem than to imipenem, and Enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. Results for Ps. maltophilia and Haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity testing.
TI  - Evidence relating bacterial vaginosis to intraamniotic infection.
AB  - We performed a two-part study to determine relationships of bacterial vaginosis and intraamniotic infection. In the first part of the study, we determined whether bacterial vaginosis organisms (Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes) were associated with each other in the amniotic fluid of 408 cases of intraamniotic infection. In the second part, we determined the association of bacterial vaginosis itself with intraamniotic infection in 125 cases at high risk for intraamniotic infection. Strong associations were observed among the bacterial vaginosis organisms in amniotic fluid (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001). Women with bacterial vaginosis were more likely to develop intraamniotic infection than those without bacterial vaginosis (69% vs. 46%, p = 0.03). Women with bacterial vaginosis were more likely to have G. vaginalis and M. hominis in the amniotic fluid (p less than 0.01 and 0.04, respectively). These observations implicate bacterial vaginosis as a cause of intraamniotic infection.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a common, non-inflammatory infection of the vagina. It is  characterised by the presence of a thin, homogenous, greyish-white discharge. The differential diagnosis includes infection with Trichomonas vaginalis and Candida albicans. A diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis may be made by the detection of three of the following: characteristic discharge, pH of 5 or greater, clue cells and a positive KOH amine test. Culture of vaginal discharge is not necessary to effect a diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis responds readily to treatment with metronidazole at a dosage of 400 mg twice daily for seven days, although a proportion of patients suffer a recurrence of symptoms. Treatment of sexual partners may be necessary in such cases. Bacterial vaginosis results from the synergistic interaction of Gardnerella vaginalis and obligate anaerobes, including Bacteroides and Mobiluncus species. The pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and the mechanisms by which these organisms produce the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis are discussed.
TI  - Humoral circulatory immune response to Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Strain-specific circulating immunoglobulin G and/or M was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence test by using Formol-treated suspensions of Gardnerella vaginalis from 28 women with overt vaginitis but only three symptom-free subjects among 43 otherwise healthy women found to be colonized by G. vaginalis. Analogous but less stringent strain specificity patterns were elicited by immunization of BALB/c mice.
TI  - Clue cells in bacterial vaginosis: immunofluorescent identification of the adherent gram-negative bacteria as Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Clue cells are epithelial cells covered by adherent gram-negative rods, observed  in vaginal smears from women with bacterial vaginosis. Immunofluorescence studies were used to identify the gram-negative bacteria adhering to clue cells. Specific antisera to four common gram-negative vaginal bacteria (Gardnerella, Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Mobiluncus) were prepared by long-term, multiple, small-inoculum immunization of rabbits. Cross-reactivity with heterologous common vaginal bacteria was removed by absorption against whole cells of heterologous bacteria and by serial dilution. Gardnerella vaginalis was most often observed adhering to the surface of clue cells and was detected on the surface of exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells significantly more frequently and in higher numbers than were Mobiluncus, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium, suggesting that this species of gram-negative bacteria is responsible for clue cell formation.
TI  - Prevalence of common infective agents of vaginitis.
AB  - A total of 100 women with vaginitis and 50 age matched healthy women were studied for common infective agents of vaginitis. The vaginal secretions collected from these women were examined for Trichomonas vaginalis, G. vaginalis, and Candida species. The prevalence of infective agents in the patients was T. vaginalis 11 per cent. Candida species 30 per cent and Gardnerella vaginalis 31 per cent. In contrast, in the control group the prevalence was Candida species 14 per cent and G. vaginalis 22 per cent. T. vaginalis was not isolated from any of the control women. Mixed infections with G. vaginalis and Candida species were seen in four cases and T. vaginalis and Candida species in one case only. Mixed infection with T. vaginalis ahd G. vaginalis was not observed in any of the patients studied.

AB  - Although other methods exist for routine identification of most sexually transmitted diseases, the pathologist can often recognize the etiologic agents or their cytologic effects on Papanicolaou (Pap) smear. Useful clinical information requires both the ability to recognize these effects and knowledge of their limitations. Pap smear changes characteristic of Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex virus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida sp., and human papillomavirus infections are described and their diagnostic accuracy evaluated.
TI  - Importance of Gardnerella vaginalis as an aetiological agent in bacterial vaginosis.

TI  - Sexually transmitted pathogens in pregnant women in a rural South African community.
AB  - One hundred and ninety three consecutive pregnant women attending peripheral antenatal clinics attached to Ngwelezana Hospital, Empangeni, Kwa-Zulu, were examined for evidence of sexually transmitted pathogens. The following incidences were found: Trichomonas vaginalis 49.2% (95), Candida spp 38.3% (74), Chlamydia trachomatis 11.4% (22), Gardnerella vaginalis 6.2% (12), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 5.7% (11), positive syphilis serology results 11.9% (23), hepatitis B surface antigen 4.1% (eight). No woman had antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Dyskaryotic smears were found in 20 (10.4%). Human papillomavirus (HPV) was detected cytologically in 11 (5.7%). The range of sexually transmitted pathogens found in this rural community was similar to that found in urban groups studied in South Africa.
TI  - The value of routine cervical cultures before transcervical chorionic villus sampling.
AB  - In 226 women requesting chorionic villus sampling (CVS), routine cervical cultures were obtained before the procedure. Transcervical CVS was performed irrespective of the test results. The prevalence of potential pathogens in cervical cultures at our institution is low. Beta haemolytic Streptococcus was cultured in 3 per cent of the women. No pathogenic microorganisms were isolated in 64 per cent of the women. There was no relationship between culture results and the outcome of pregnancy. These observations suggest that adequate antiseptic cleansing of the genital tract is a suitable approach and there is no need to routinely perform cultures before CVS.
TI  - Vaginitis and pregnancy.
AB  - Vaginitis in pregnant women can affect the outcome of the pregnancy through preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, neonatal infection and postpartum endometritis. Women can be screened for group B streptococci, and infection in the newborn can be prevented by the institution of antibiotic therapy in labor. Screening pregnant women for bacterial vaginitis can reduce the risk of premature rupture of the membranes, premature labor and neonatal infection.
TI  - Should male consorts of women with bacterial vaginosis be treated?
AB  - Nitroimidazoles have been shown to be the drugs of choice to treat women with bacterial vaginosis, but the recurrence rate is high. Some workers have suggested that the recurrence of symptoms may in fact be reinfection by male consorts, but no controlled studies have been undertaken to confirm this. In an international, multicentre, randomised, double blind trial, the recurrence rate was studied in 241 women with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. All women were treated with 2 g metronidazole twice at an interval of two days. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups, one contained 123 women, whose consorts were given the same dose of metronidazole, the other consisted of 118 women whose consorts were given inert but identical placebo tablets. The women were evaluated at weeks 1, 4, and 12 after treatment. At week 1, the cure rate was 97% (115/119) in women whose consorts had been treated and 98% (111/113) in the others. At week 4 bacterial vaginosis had recurred in 17% (19/112) of women whose consorts had been treated and in 13% (14/106) of those whose consorts had received placebo. At week 12 the recurrence rates were 21% (20/95) in women with treated consorts, and 16% (15/95) in the others. The differences in recurrence rates between the two groups of women were not significant. In conclusion, treating the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis does not seem to increase the cure rate.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: etiology, association with preterm labor, diagnosis, and management.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial condition (anaerobes, Gardnerella vaginalis) that is associated with symptomatic vaginal discharge. Bacterial vaginosis can be reliably diagnosed through clinical indicators such as clue cells on wet preparation of vaginal discharge, an increased pH of vaginal discharge, a fishy, amine odor emitted when a sample of vaginal discharge is placed in potassium hydroxide, and cultures that isolate G. vaginalis. The vaginal discharge is often heavy and foul smelling, and usually resolves when treated with metronidazole, 500 mg twice a day for seven days. It is unclear whether bacterial vaginosis is caused by G. vaginalis or whether G. vaginalis is simply associated with the condition and its development is related to other factors. More importantly, the association of bacterial vaginosis with preterm labor (whether merely a risk factor or a causal factor) needs to be clarified, and the question of whether treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy will improve fetal outcome by decreasing prematurity needs to be addressed.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis has a gram-positive cell-wall ultrastructure and lacks classical cell-wall lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis has a very thin cell wall with a characteristic gram-negative staining pattern and an apparent lamellar structure when viewed at an oblique angle by electronmicroscopy. Examination at right angles to the cell-wall plane and by freeze-etching showed absence of an outer membrane or any other lamellar structure. Cell-wall extracts made by methods specific for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) gave negative reactions by silver staining and for endotoxin in the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. 2-Keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octonoic acid (KDO), heptose and hydroxy fatty acids specific for LPS were not detected in the extracts. G. vaginalis cell walls are unequivocally gram-positive in their ultrastructural characteristics and chemical composition.
TI  - Interstitial cystitis and the urethral syndrome: a possible answer.
AB  - A study was made of 20 patients fulfilling the criteria customarily used for the  diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. A possible infective aetiology was sought by culture of bladder tissue, catheter and midstream specimens of urine, and urethral swabs by methods capable of detecting fastidious bacteria as well as aerobic pathogens. All bladder biopsies showed the histological appearances usually associated with interstitial cystitis, and bacteria were isolated from the catheter specimens and/or bladder biopsies of 12 patients. Eight of these isolates were fastidious bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis (6) and Lactobacillus sp. (2). Fastidious bacteria were isolated from the midstream specimen of urine (MSU) and/or urethral swab of 6 other patients. The correlation of the histological and bacteriological findings supports the hypothesis of an infective aetiology and suggests that the so-called urethral syndrome and interstitial cystitis may be the earlier and later stages of the same disease process. The importance of early diagnosis of infection in these patients is emphasised.
TI  - Randomized treatment of mucopurulent cervicitis with doxycycline or amoxicillin.
AB  - A randomized trial of doxycycline versus amoxicillin was performed to treat mucopurulent cervicitis. Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common single agent associated with mucopurulent cervicitis, was isolated from 30 (47%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae from five (8%) of 64 patients. Patients were followed up for 3 months, and the effect of treatment was assessed by clinical (presence of endocervical mucopus, cervicitis severity score, and number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram-stained smears of endocervical secretions) and microbiologic criteria. Doxycycline and amoxicillin were equally effective for treating chlamydial and nonchlamydial cervicitis. However, endocervical mucopus was still present in 18% of the patients in both treatment groups after 2 months and in 23% of the doxycycline group and 33% of the amoxicillin group after 3 months of therapy. The cause of persistent/recurrent mucopus after antimicrobial treatment was not explained by relapse or reinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, genital mycoplasmas, or Gardnerella vaginalis, but persistence was associated with the degree of cervical ectopy.
TI  - [A microbiology clinic in outpatient gynecologic service].
AB  - The authors report on their experiences gained at the sexually transmitted disease clinic they established at the First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Semmelweis Medical University. A total of 456 patients presenting with signs and symptoms of lower genital tract infection have been examined in one year. The investigation of patients included aerobic and anaerobic culture of vaginal bacteria, vaginal smear and the identification of sexually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasmatales and Gardnerella vaginalis. The authors conclude that a sexually transmitted disease clinic is appropriate to contribute to the prevention of horizontal and vertical spread of the sexually transmitted bacterial infections.
TI  - Comparison of the in vitro activities of fenticonazole, other imidazoles, metronidazole, and tetracycline against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and skin infections.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was  compared with those of clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (BV) or skin infections by agar dilution MIC determinations. BV-associated Bacteroides isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus-B. oralis group, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole; but Bacteroides spp. not associated with BV, Bacteroides ureolyticus and the Bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. All Bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of G. vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. varied. Among the skin bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. This antibacterial activity may give fenticonazole a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria.
TI  - Association of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis with intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery. The John Hopkins Study of Cervicitis and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome.
AB  - The authors conducted a prospective study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (birth weight less than a standard (race- and sex-adjusted) 10th percentile for gestational age) and preterm birth (birth prior to 37 weeks gestation) in a high-risk, inner-city, obstetric population, with special interest in pathogens colonizing the maternal genital tract. A total of 801 women within 22 to 30 weeks of gestation were enrolled and interviewed. Subjects were cultured for Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bacteroides fragilis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Candida albicans, and they were followed to delivery. Intrauterine growth retardation and preterm delivery occurred in 8% and 13% of these pregnancies, respectively. After adjustment for other important risk factors, colonization with C. trachomatis was significantly associated both with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 2.4, 90% confidence interval 1.32-4.18) and preterm delivery (odds ratio = 1.6, 90% confidence interval 1.01-2.50). Colonization with C. albicans was significantly associated with intrauterine growth retardation (odds ratio = 1.9, 90% confidence interval 1.20-3.14); colonization with M. hominis was significantly associated with preterm birth (odds ratio = 2.0, 90% confidence interval 1.42-2.93). These associations support the probable role of infection in preterm and intrauterine growth retardation births and suggest the need for carefully designed intervention studies.
TI  - Differentiation of Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans, and Trichomonas vaginalis infections of the vagina.
AB  - This study evaluated the positive predictive values of factors associated with Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans, and Trichomonas vaginalis for diagnosing vaginitis in a community-based population. One hundred ninety-six women with and without vaginal complaints were evaluated for historical factors, physical examination findings, and office laboratory results that were potentially associated with each of the three vaginal organisms. Extensive microbiological tests were performed to detect pathogenic organisms in the vagina and cervix. Gardnerella vaginalis was associated with findings of clue cells, gray or creamy vaginal discharge, amine ordor on application of potassium hydroxide solution to the discharge, pH greater than 5, and a history of more than six sexual partners. Candida albicans was associated with the presence of pseudohyphae or budding yeast on microscopic examination and the lack of clue cells. Current use of oral contraceptives and the recent use of antibiotics were not predictive of a Candida albicans infection. Trichomonas vaginalis was more common in patients presenting with symptoms, but otherwise was not predicted by the factors tested.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pristinamycin and its components against gram-negative anaerobic bacilli and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The comparative in-vitro activities of pristinamycin, its components pristinamycins I and IIA, erythromycin, clindamycin and metronidazole were studied against 174 clinical isolates of Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli and 24 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Susceptibilities were determined with an agar-dilution method. Against Bacteroides and Fusobacterium, pristinamycin was slightly less active than both clindamycin and metronidazole and more active than erythromycin. Against G. vaginalis, the activity of pristinamycin was similar to that of clindamycin and slightly inferior to that of erythromycin. Both pristinamycins I and IIA alone were generally inactive against the strains tested. Additionally, MICs for the B. fragilis group determined by a broth microdilution technique were one to two log2 lower than MICs obtained by agar-dilution. The bactericidal activity of pristinamycin and clindamycin was moderate and varied according to the strains tested. The chequerboard broth microdilution test against 20 strains of the B. fragilis group confirmed the synergy between pristinamycins I and IIA at every PI/PIIA ratio. Along with the activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma and both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, our results suggest that pristinamycin could be an effective drug in the treatment of gynaecological infections.
TI  - Comparison of methods for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women.
AB  - The diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually based on clinical criteria including homogeneous vaginal discharge, an elevated vaginal pH, the presence of clue cells, and an amine odor. We have evaluated the vaginal flora and clinical signs for 593 pregnant women. Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp., and Mycoplasma hominis were isolated more frequently among women with clinical signs than among those without clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis in multivariable analyses that controlled for other bacteria. To determine the laboratory method that best predicted bacterial vaginosis, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of positive and negative tests for Gram-stained vaginal smears, gas-liquid chromatography of vaginal fluid, and G. vaginalis cultures compared with clinical signs. G. vaginalis culture was sensitive (92%) and both gas-liquid chromatography (78%) and Gram-stained vaginal smears (62%) were moderately sensitive in identifying women with three of the four clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis. However, the Gram-stained vaginal smear (95%) was more specific than G. vaginalis culture (69%) or gas-liquid chromatography (81%). The predictive value of a positive test was also higher for the Gram staining (76%) than for G. vaginalis culture (41%) or gas-liquid chromatography (48%).
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia from pulmonary abscess in a male alcohol abuser.
AB  - A case of Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia is reported. This bacteremia occurred  in a male alcohol abuser who developed definite signs of pulmonary abscess and empyema. Streptococcus milleri grew from another blood culture, but Gardnerella vaginalis was also isolated from a bronchoscopic aspirate and pleural drainage sample as part of mixed flora containing anaerobes, Streptococcus species, Neisseria sicca, and a Haemophilus sp. We discuss the possible pathogenic character of G. vaginalis outside the genital tract from a review of the literature.
TI  - The cytologist and bacterioses of the vaginal-ectocervical area. Clues, commas and confusion.
AB  - To evaluate the role of the cytologist in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, the predominant bacterial patterns seen in 157 Papanicolaou-stained cervical smears were assessed and classified as large bacillus, anaerobic or scanty. A large bacillus pattern was found in 73 smears (46%), an anaerobic pattern in 77 (49%) and scanty bacteria in 7 (5%). Comma-shaped (curved) bacilli were found in 34 smears. The prevalence of clue cells in smears with anaerobic patterns was 73%. Gardnerella vaginalis was cultured from 89% of the cases with anaerobic-type smears containing clue cells and from 88% of those with anaerobic-type smears lacking clue cells. Mobiluncus sp. was cultured from 83% of the cases with anaerobic-type smears showing curved bacilli and 14% of those with anaerobic-type smears lacking curved bacilli. Papanicolaou-stained smears were found to be more sensitive and more specific for identifying clue cells than were wet preparations. A positive association was found between a positive KOH "whiff" test and the presence of curved bacilli on the Papanicolaou-stained smear. The clinical significance of these findings is discussed.
TI  - Diagnostic procedures in vaginitis.
AB  - Ninety-seven vaginitis patients underwent a standardized direct method of examination. Bacterial vaginosis was found in 38.1%, Candida albicans in 24.7% and Trichomonas vaginalis in 13.4%. Low secretional pH values were never met in bacterial vaginosis and T. vaginalis cases. A fishy odor, present in bacterial vaginosis, was also found in almost half of the T. vaginalis cases. Endocervical bacteriological cultures are probably insufficient with respect to the detection of C. albicans and Gardnerella vaginalis. However, we found 12.4% Chlamydia trachomatis, which indicates that endocervical bacteriology may be indicated in vaginitis patients.
TI  - Differentiation of some species of Neisseriaceae and other bacterial groups by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - DNA-DNA hybridization using total genomic DNA probes may represent a way of differentiating between miscellaneous bacterial species. This was studied with type and reference strains of 20 species in Moraxella, Kingella, and other selected Gram-negative groups. Both radioactive and biotin labelling were employed. Most of the species examined were easily distinguished, such as Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, M.(B.) ovis, M. atlantae, M. phenylpyruvica, M. osloensis, Neisseria elongata, N. meningitidis, Kingella kingae, K. indologenes, K. dentrificans, Oligella urethralis, Eikenella corrodens, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and DF-2. This reflected the extent of the genetic distances between them as a basis for identification by hybridization. There was some clustering in the Moraxella group. Especially the closely related Moraxella nonliquefaciens, M. lacunata and M. bovis showed strong hybridization affinities. This leads to potential problems in distinguishing these three species from each other by DNA-DNA hybridization with total genomic probes alone.
TI  - [In vitro activity of 5 new quinolones against Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of five new quinolones were determined by agar dilution, for 50 clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. They are compared with those of metronidazole, ampicillin, erythromycin and tetracycline which are widely used for the treatment of lower genital tract infections in women. The MICs of rosoxacin and pefloxacin are high, but those of ofloxacin (MIC 50, 2 mg/l), fleroxacin (MIC 50, 2 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MIC 50, 1 mg/l) are lower. They can explain the effectiveness observed with this latter antibiotic in vivo, and allow their clinical experiment.
TI  - Identification of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp., and other fastidious gram-negative bacteria with the MicroScan Haemophilus-Neisseria identification panel.
AB  - The Haemophilus-Neisseria identification (HNID) panel (American MicroScan, Sacramento, Calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of Haemophilus and Neisseria spp., Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis. The HNID panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and HNID identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. In addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the HNID data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. The HNID panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 G. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28 Neisseria lactamica strains and 48 B. catarrhalis strains. Only 64.7% of 68 Neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. Among the Haemophilus spp., 98.8% of 83 H. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 H. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 H. aphrophilus and H. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. Eight strains of Neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for B. catarrhalis and N. gonorrhoeae. Isolates of other species not included in the data base, including Eikenella corrodens, Kingella spp., and Cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. Modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species, and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and utility of the HNID panel.
TI  - Chemotaxis inhibition by Gardnerella vaginalis and succinate producing vaginal anaerobes: composition of vaginal discharge associated with G vaginalis.
AB  - The influence of six succinate producing vaginal anaerobes and Gardnerella vaginalis on the chemotactic activity of granulocytes was studied by the under agarose method. G vaginalis, Mobiluncus species, and three Gram negative anaerobes elicited hardly any response, but Peptostreptococcus productus showed clear positive chemotaxis, as did the Escherichia coli strain used as a control. Inhibition of the chemotactic response of white blood cells was found with all strains, but the high succinate producers from the genus Bacteroides showed the most pronounced effect. The inhibition of chemotaxis by succinate producing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis (NSV) is postulated, and B ureolyticus or Mobiluncus spp, rather than G vaginalis, are suggested as possible causes of NSV.
TI  - Subclinical intra-amniotic infection with Gardnerella vaginalis associated with preterm delivery. Case report.
AB  
TI  - [Vulvo-cervico-vaginal infections caused by common (non-herpetic) germs].
AB  - The three main types of infections affecting the lower genital tract are due to:  Gardnerella, Gonococcus and Chlamydia. The author's text and tables summarize the epidemiology and the management of such infections.
TI  - [Contraception and Gardnerella vaginalis. First study of the Italian population].
AB  - The association between contraception and Gardnerella vaginalis was studied in the population of L'Aquila. This research was conducted in the cytocolposcopic Center of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinic, and the Department of Biotechnology and Biometry at L'Aquila University on 1212 females. Of the examined patients, 178 (14.7%) employed a prophylactic method and of these 104 (58.4%) used barrier-systems, while 74 (41.6%) used estroprogestins. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 63 females (6.1%) that used no contraceptive and 19 (10.7%) that employed one.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis in Cu T 200 users.
AB  - Vaginal samples obtained from intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) users with  and without vaginitis and from healthy non-users were studied for presence of G. vaginalis and cytological changes. Vaginitis was present in 29.5 per cent IUD users and most of them (76%) yielded G. vaginalis. G. vaginalis was also recovered from asymptomatic IUD users and from non-users, but heavy colonisation was infrequent. The presence of clue cells and many small Gram negative bacilli and scanty lactobacilli were associated with G. vaginalis recovery. Inflammation was more frequent in IUD users than in non-users (P less than 0.001). A significant correlation was also found between inflammatory changes and G. vaginalis colonisation among all groups of patients.
TI  - Evaluation of the enhanced rapid identification method for Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The enhanced rapid identification method (RIM; Austin Biological Laboratories), a micromethod for the identification of Gardnerella vaginalis, is based on starch and raffinose fermentation and hippurate hydrolysis. We tested 105 clinical isolates of G. vaginalis with both the RIM and standard biochemical tests. The RIM agreed with the standard biochemical methods for 96 (91.4%) of the strains; nine isolates which were hippurate hydrolysis positive by standard biochemical tests were hippurate hydrolysis negative in the RIM. RIM may serve as a useful adjunct to Gram stain and colony morphology for the identification of G. vaginalis.
TI  - Quality control standards for the proline aminopeptidase assay used to detect bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - We describe the preparation and usage of positive and negative quality control standards for the proline aminopeptidase assay of vaginal secretions as an indicator of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Chlamydiazyme test for rapid detection of Chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  - Endocervical (120) and endourethral (104) swabs collected from patients attending the Gynaecological OPD and STD Clinic of a Hospital, in north India were subjected to the chlamydiazyme test to detect C. trachomatis antigen. This antigen was detected in 25 per cent (30 of 120) of cervical and 20.19 per cent (21 of 104) of urethral specimens. Of the 51 antigen positive cases, 30 (58.8%) presented with the clinical picture of cervicitis, 11 (21.5%) with urethritis, 6 (11.7%) were cases of primary infertility and 4 (7.8%) were healthy controls. The association of C. trachomatis and other sexually manifested microorganisms (Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis) was found more commonly in patients of cervicitis, especially those who were C. trachomatis antigen positive.
TI  - Evaluation and management of vaginitis. An update for primary care practitioners.
AB  - There are three major causes of vaginitis symptoms that primary care practitioners should be able to diagnose and treat expertly. Recent investigations have shown that bacterial vaginosis, the most common cause of vaginitis symptoms in patients not seen in sexually transmitted disease clinics, has a multifactorial etiology: Gardnerella vaginalis is universally present but is not, per se, the etiologic agent. Diagnosis and treatment are based, therefore, on evidence of a disturbed bacterial ecology as well as the presence of "clue" cells that indicate the presence of Gardnerella. Trichomonas vaginitis is usually easy to diagnose, but treatment failures occasionally occur. Some strains of Trichomonas vaginalis may be relatively resistant to metronidazole, and short-course therapy may lead to reinfection from sexual partners. Candida vulvovaginitis, the third major type of vaginitis, is not a sexually transmitted disease and should be viewed as vaginal "thrush." Earlier treatment regimens have been simplified by the introduction of more potent antifungals.
TI  - Electron microscopy of adhesive interactions between Gardnerella vaginalis and vaginal epithelial cells, McCoy cells and human red blood cells.
AB  - Exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells with attached bacteria, termed 'clue cells',  which were procured from a patient with non-specific vaginitis, were stained with ruthenium red and examined by transmission electron microscopy. The attached bacteria appeared to adhere by means of an outer fibrillar coat. An epithelial tissue culture cell line (McCoy) and human red blood cells to which strains of Gardnerella vaginalis attached were similarly examined. The adherence of G. vaginalis to the epithelial cell line appeared to be mediated by an outer fibrillar coat while adherence to red cells appeared to be mediated by fimbriae. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on the Gardnerella strains used. Thin sections of tissue-culture-adherent strains revealed a dense outer fibrillar coat whereas the surface of the haemagglutinating strains showed fine fimbriae. Negative staining of haemagglutinating strains demonstrated fimbriae on a minority of organisms.
TI  - Prevalence of hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacillus species in normal women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A predominance of Lactobacillus species in the vaginal flora is considered normal. In women with bacterial vaginosis, the prevalence and concentrations of intravaginal Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes are increased, whereas the prevalence of intravaginal Lactobacillus species is decreased. Because some lactobacilli are known to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can be toxic to organisms that produce little or no H2O2-scavenging enzymes (e.g., catalase), we postulated that an absence of H2O2-producing Lactobacillus species could allow an overgrowth of catalase-negative organisms, such as those found among women with bacterial vaginosis. In this study, H2O2-producing facultative Lactobacillus species were found in the vaginas of 27 (96%) of 28 normal women and 4 (6%) of 67 women with bacterial vaginosis (P less than 0.001). Anaerobic Lactobacillus species (which do not produce hydrogen peroxide) were isolated from 24 (36%) of 67 women with bacterial vaginosis and 1 (4%) of 28 normal women (P less than 0.001). The production of H2O2 by Lactobacillus species may represent a nonspecific antimicrobial defense mechanism of the normal vaginal ecosystem.
TI  - [Etiology of cervicovaginal infection in pregnant and non-pregnant patients].
AB  - A prospective study to evaluate the prevalence of specific microorganisms in pregnant and nonpregnant women with cervicovaginitis attended at the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, was done; Candida sp, Gardnerella vaginalis, Replasma urealitycum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Group B Streptococcus, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae were investigated. Two hundred thirty four patients were studied, 105/234 (44.9%) pregnant and 129/234 (55.1%) nonpregnant women, with a mean age of 26.5 years (range 14 to 44 years). One hundred eighty one (77.5%) women had only one sexual partner. The most common microorganisms seen were Candida sp (31.6%), Gardnerella vaginalis (27.7) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (15.8%). Infection by Chlamydia trachomatis was documented in 9.8% of the population. Trichomonas vaginalis was identified in 1.7%, there was not any case of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. Candida sp and Ureaplasma urealyticum were founded more frequent in the pregnant women than nonpregnant women, 41.9% vs. 24.8% (p less than 0.01) and 20% vs. 12.4% (p less than 0.05) respectively. Group B Streptococci was isolated as a single agent in 4.8% in pregnant women. There were not found any pathogenic microorganisms in 29.9% of the cases, as a causal agent of symptomatic cervicovaginitis.
TI  - [Examination of young women with recurrent symptoms of cystitis].
AB  - Fifty women with recurrent symptoms of cystitis (urgent onset of painful and frequent voiding) were extensively examined bacteriologically. All were submitted to intravenous urography, cystoscopy, gynaecological and urodynamic examination and the urine was examined cytologically and by culture. A control group of 10 healthy women were submitted to the same bacteriologic examinations. Only in a few cases did the investigations give an explanation of the condition but, generally, the examination programme did not contribute to the etiology. Chlamydia trachomatis was found in 6%, which was comparable to the normal population. Gardnerella vaginalis must be considered as part of the normal flora. The extensive examination programme cannot be recommended as a routine.
TI  - [Relationship between clinical diagnosis and microbiological diagnosis of symptomatic vaginitis].
AB  - After comparing the referral diagnoses of women with vaginitis sen to our cervicovaginitis out-patient clinic at the Ospedale Fatebenefratelli e Oftalmico of Milan with the subsequent bacteriological diagnoses, the Authors emphasize that treatment for the different types of vaginitis must be prescribed only after accurate and thorough bacteriological examination in order to avoid inadequate treatment and unnecessary discomfort to the patients.
TI  - Effect of low-dose oral contraceptives on natural killer cell activity.
AB  - Several reports indicate an association between oral contraceptives and increased infection rates. One mechanism that could explain this increased infection rate is a decrease in immune function. A study comparing T cell subsets showed no differences in numbers between oral contraceptive users and controls. In this study, natural killer cell activity was compared in women before and 3 and 6 months after oral contraceptive use. There was a statistically significant decrease in NK cell activity after three months. There was no further decrease by six months and the differences were no longer significant due to greater variability. No infections were reported during the study period. Thus, the observed reduction in NK activity was either physiologically insignificant or the previously reported increase in infections may be the result of non-immunological factors.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis in infections of the urinary tract.
AB  - During a period of 6 months, urine from 3576 patients was cultured for Gardnerella vaginalis. Specimens from 32 patients yielded this species. Eleven (0.3%) of the isolates were judged to be of clinical importance. Seven were from women and four from men. Two of these patients, both women, suffered from spontaneous cystitis. Hence G. vaginalis is very unusual as a primary pathogen in the urinary tract. More often it may cause infections related to urological abnormalities or as a complication of urological procedures. Two of the men in our series had chronic prostatitis, one an infected urinoma. All six remaining patients had either undergone a urological procedure or had had an indwelling urethral catheter for more than 6 hours. A selective medium for G. vaginalis is recommended for screening cultures before urological procedures and when this species is suspected on microscopy. The role of metronidazole in extravaginal infections is discussed and the use of an antibiotic more active against G. vaginalis is recommended.
TI  - Early postpartum endometritis: the role of bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis.
AB  - To characterize the flora of early postpartum endometritis and the clinical features of women with specific organisms, endometrial cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis were taken with a triple-lumen sampling device. More than one organism was recovered from 80% of the women. Over 60% of the women had Gardnerella vaginalis and/or anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis isolated from the endometrium; these women were more likely to have severe illness and to develop a wound infection than were other women. Genital mycoplasmas were isolated frequently, but specific antibiotic therapy was not required for clinical cure in the 10% of patients who had Ureaplasma urealyticum only. Chlamydia trachomatis was infrequently isolated, but C trachomatis commonly remained after therapy.
TI  - [Genital infections in adolescence].
AB  - In 126 patients with relapsing cervicitis or abnormal cytologic findings, aged 13-19 years (12.5% were virgins), the most frequently bacteria were Ureaplasma urealyticum (30.2%), Mycoplasma hominis, and Gardnerella vaginalis (14.3%), and Chlamydia trachomatis (9.5%). In patients with abnormal cytologic findings, Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated most frequently--5 times in group IIIa after Papanicolaou and 4 times in group IIIb, followed by Mycoplasma hominis 3 times in group IIIa and IIIb each. Koilocytes were found twice in groups IIIa and IIIb each.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis: role of a microorganism emerging as a vaginopathic agent  and its placement in the vaginal microbial ecosystem].
AB  - In this review the role of an emergent pathogen, Gardnerella vaginalis (G. vaginalis), as aetiologic agent of the so called "non specific vaginitis" is systematically evaluated. The microorganism is described in its morphological, biochemical and virulence aspects in the framework of the complex vaginal ecosystem. The diagnostic criteria of the disease as well as a possible association of G. vaginalis with other vaginal bacteria, especially anaerobes, in the aetiology of the disease, are discussed. Literature data on prevalence and incidence of G. vaginalis in different population groups are integrated by more recent investigations of the Authors on prevalence and carriage of microorganism in a group of outpatients in Italy.
TI  - The clinical significance of the genital microbiologic flora at vacuum aspiration following miscarriage.
AB  - 85 women undergoing vacuum aspiration following miscarriage were studied. At the  time of vacuum aspiration, immunofluorescent stainings for detection of C. trachomatis proved positive in 5.9% of the patients. Group B streptococci were isolated in 7.5%, coliforms in 3.5%, and Gardnerella vaginalis in 51% of the patients. The overall frequency of postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was 3.5%, whereas 40% of chlamydia-positive women contracted postabortal PID (p less than 0.05). No significant relation between other microorganisms and postabortal PID was observed. The duration of postabortal bleeding was unrelated to the genital microbiologic flora. Based on anamnestic information about previous pregnancies and duration of preoperative bleeding it was possible to define subgroups at risk of harboring C. trachomatis and coliforms. The clinical significance of this is unknown.
TI  - Roxithromycin. A review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. It has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. Roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. The results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. Clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. In a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. Roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis is not a simple ecological disorder.
AB  - Eighty-four patients with bacterial vaginosis were examined in an open randomized trial, the aim of which was to define clinical results and the microbiological panorama after topical treatment for 1 week with either an acetic acid jelly (A), an estrogen cream (B), a fermented milk product (C) or metronidazole (D). After exclusion because of chlamydia infection (15 cases) or for other reasons, 61 cases remained for complete evaluation 4 weeks after the start of treatment. Clinical cure was obtained in 3 cases out of 17 on regimen A, in 1 out of 16 on regimen B, in 1 of 14 on regimen C, and in 13 out of 14 on regimen D. The patients were conclusively either symptomless or symptomatic when examined on 113 occasions. Statistically significant reduction after treatment resulting in relief of symptoms was observed in the numbers of corynebacteria and anaerobic cocci, whereas lactobacilli increased in numbers. The instillation of high numbers of Lactobacillus acidophilus (C) into the vagina cured only 1 patient and did not influence the predominance of lactobacilli in the vagina at the follow-up examination. The difference in microbiological profile of women in symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions becomes still more apparent when the results of the present and previously published studies on the subject by the present group of investigators are combined. The symptomatic woman is significantly more often harboring corynebacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococci, peptococci, eubacteria and Bacteroides species. Lactobacilli are significantly reduced in numbers. However, only 51% of our previously symptomatic, but now symptomless women show predominant growth of lactobacilli, which is less than expected for healthy women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis: an unusual case of pyogenic liver abscess.
AB  - We present a case of pyogenic liver abscess caused by Gardnerella vaginalis, a previously unreported suppurative complication of infection with this organism. The development of the pylephlebitis originating from endometritis and the possible synergistic interaction of an anaerobic and aerobic organism is reviewed. G. vaginalis has been infrequently isolated in the laboratory; perhaps with refined culturing techniques and recognition of the pathogenic potential of this organism, further cases of suppurative complications will be described.
TI  - A randomized study of antibiotic therapy in idiopathic preterm labor.
AB  - A randomized study was undertaken to test the effects of antibiotics as an adjunct to established methods of tocolysis. One hundred fifty patients with cervical dilation of 1 cm or more and no clinically identifiable cause for preterm labor qualified for the study. Fifty-three (35%) received 500 mg ampicillin orally every 6 hours, 50 (33%) received 500 mg erythromycin orally every 6 hours, and 47 served as controls. Antibiotics were prescribed for 10 days, and the treatment was not altered by the results of cervical cultures. Of these 150 patients, 16 (11%) had positive amniotic fluid cultures. The pregnancies with positive amniotic fluid culture were characterized by significantly less time gained after admission (2.6 versus 28.7 days) and lower birth weight (1262 versus 2470 g) than in those with negative cultures. Histologic studies of the placenta revealed chorioamnionitis in 22 (16%) of 134 patients with negative amniotic fluid cultures; these pregnancies were associated with less time gained after admission (12.5 versus 31.9 days) and lower birth weight (1680 versus 2618 g) compared with pregnancies without histologic chorioamnionitis. In patients with similar gestational age and cervical dilation, the adjunctive use of antibiotic therapy resulted in a statistically significant delay from admission to delivery (30 versus 17 days). In cases of negative amniotic fluid cultures, cervical colonization with group B streptococcus and/or Gardnerella vaginalis increased the risk of prematurity, which improved significantly when ampicillin was given.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: a comprehensive review.
AB  - In summary, bacterial vaginosis infections are very common, easy to diagnose, and usually quite simple to treat. Rarely are symptoms dramatic, and often the woman is unaware of the presence of this infection. Partners should be treated, and thorough health education should be provided to both patient and partner. Further research is needed to develop safer, equally effective treatments for this infection. Currently metronidazole is the drug of choice, except in pregnant women. Possible serious problems may result from untreated bacterial vaginosis infections; therefore, routine treatment to resolve this infection is recommended. Preventative measures should always be reviewed with each patient and regular check-ups are recommended, especially for sexually active individuals.

TI  - A case-control study of chorioamnionic infection and histologic chorioamnionitis  in prematurity.
AB  - To study the role of infection in prematurity, we studied the demographic and obstetrical characteristics, chorioamnionic cultures, and placental histologic features of women who delivered prematurely and compared these findings with those in women who delivered at term. Microorganisms were isolated from the area between the chorion and the amnion (chorioamnion) in 23 of 38 placentas (61 percent) from women with preterm labor who delivered before 37 weeks' gestation and in 12 (21 percent) of 56 placentas from women without preterm labor who delivered at term (odds ratio, 5.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 15.6). The most frequent isolates from the placentas of those whose infants were delivered prematurely were Ureaplasma urealyticum (47 percent) and Gardnerella vaginalis (26 percent). The recovery of any organism from the chorioamnion was strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 7.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 19.5) and with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio, 3.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.6). When multiple logistic regression was used to control for demographic and obstetrical variables, premature delivery was still related to the recovery of organisms from the chorioamnion (odds ratio, 3.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 9.9) and with chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 5.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 15.3). The proportion of placentas with evidence of infection was highest among those who delivered at the lowest gestational age. We conclude that infection of the chorioamnion is strongly related to histologic chorioamnionitis and may be a cause of premature birth.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind randomized trial of the effect of treatment of the sexual partner.
AB  - In a double-blind randomized controlled trial we assessed the effect of metronidazole treatment of the male partner on the recurrence rate of bacterial vaginosis. Women who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis were treated with metronidazole given in single doses of 2 g on days 1 and 3. The sexual partners were randomized to receive either the same dosage of metronidazole or a placebo. A total of 107 pairs completed the study. One week after the start of treatment 89% of the women considered themselves improved or cured and 93% no longer had the diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis. At assessment 5 weeks after the treatment, 75% reported that they were cured or improved and the diagnostic criteria were not present in 73%. Treatment of the male partner did not affect subjective symptoms, clinical signs and isolation rates of Gardnerella vaginalis at 1 and 5 weeks after treatment.
TI  - Chlamydia trachomitis antigen in the cervix: prevalence in a student population.
AB  - The prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis was investigated over a two-year period in a population of women university students attending a student health clinic for routine pelvic examination or for a gynecologic complaint. Direct immunofluorescence slide test was used to determine the presence of C. trachomatis. The overall prevalence rates for the two-years periods studied were 8.2% and 7.1%. When women who had symptoms of a urogenital infection were compared to women who were asymptomatic, it was found that symptomatic women were more likely to have C. trachomatis in the cervix. To determine whether women with positive cases showed differences in appearance of the cervix, method of contraception, or other organisms colonizing the vagina, the cases were matched with two controls, and a retrospective chart review was performed. The cases were more likely to have cervicitis and to be culture positive with gardnerella vaginalis, and they were less likely to have used condoms for contraception. In the two periods studied, the carriage rates for asymptomatic cases were 6% and 5%. Fifty-eight per cent of all positive cases were asymptomatic. If this organism is to be eradicated from college-women populations, all women attending for a urogenital infection should be screened, and women attending for routine annual examinations should be screened if there is a clinical indication.

TI  - The in-vitro activity of PD127,391, a new quinolone.
AB  - MICs of PD127,391 a new 4-quinolone, and of CI934 and ciprofloxacin, two previously reported 4-quinolones, were determined for common clinical bacterial isolates by an agar-dilution method. PD127,391 was the most active drug against Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp (MICs less than 0.12 mg/l) and as active as ciprofloxacin against Aeromonas spp. (MICs less than 0.008 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs less than 1 mg/l). It was more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas spp. including Ps. maltophilia (MICs less than 0.25 mg/l). All three drugs had high activity, with PD129,391 again the best, against Haemophilus influenzae Brahmamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. PD127,391 was much more active than the other drugs against Campylobacter coli/jejuni (PD127,391 MICs less than 0.03 mg/l) and Gardnerella vaginalis (PD127,391 MICs less than 0.25 mg/l). PD127,391 inhibited all staphylococci at less than 0.06 mg/l and streptococci at less than 0.5 mg/l, thus being more active than CI934 or ciprofloxacin. PD127,391 was much more active against anaerobic cocci, Bacteroides spp. and clostridia (including Clostridium difficile) (MICs less than 1 mg/l) than was CI934 (MICs less than 16 mg/l) or ciprofloxacin (MICs less than 64 mg/l). No bacterium that we examined required more than 1 mg/l of PD127,391 for inhibition, and there was no cross resistance with unrelated antibiotics.
TI  - Microbiological profile of the cervix in 1,000 sexually active women.
AB  - One thousand consecutive women who attended the Richmond Family Planning Association Clinic and who were to undergo a vaginal examination were asked to participate in a large prospective microbiological study. Participants were questioned about their sexual activity during the previous 12 months and any apparent signs of sexually transmitted disease. On examination the cervix was inspected for evidence of inflammation, ectopy or discharge and cervical swabs were taken microbiological assessment. Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 5.1% of women tested while Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis were found in 48.8% and 16.4% of women respectively. Significant associations were found between the number of sexual partners during the previous 12 months and the incidence of all 3 organisms. The carriage rate of the genital mycoplasmas was significantly affected by the type of contraception. In addition the association between the presence of the genital mycoplasmas and pelvic and cervical abnormalities was determined.
TI  - In vitro activity of azithromycin and erythromycin against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and chancroid.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new macrolide azithromycin and erythromycin against  Haemophilus ducreyi, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus spp. was compared. Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp. and Haemophilus ducreyi were highly susceptible to both agents but azithromycin was more effective overall against all three groups of organisms. The activity of both antibiotics against Bacteroides spp. varied greatly, but azithromycin was again more active. Collectively, 62% of all Bacteroides strains were susceptible to erythromycin (MIC 1 mg/1) and 74% were susceptible to azithromycin.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (nonspecific vaginitis) is a polymicrobial, superficial vaginal infection caused by an increase in anaerobic organisms and a concomitant decrease in lactobacilli. Gardnerella vaginalis, once thought to be the sole etiologic agent, is probably one of several endogenous members of the vaginal flora that overgrow in women with bacterial vaginosis. Whether the growth of anaerobes or a primary decrease in lactobacilli is the initial pathogenic event remains unclear. Epidemiological studies have revealed that current or previous infections caused by Trichomonas organisms, increased sexual activity, and intrauterine device use are risk factors for this condition. Studies have indicated that bacterial vaginosis, previously thought to be a benign illness, is associated with some morbidity in pregnant women. Symptoms remain unreliable in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Diagnostic efficacy is best achieved by utilizing clinical signs. Assessment of cure is best accomplished by Gram stain, not clinical criteria. Metronidazole, 500 mg orally for seven days, remains the treatment of choice; however, a 2-g single dose of metronidazole represents a reasonable alternative if cost and compliance issues predominate in a clinical situation. Although a recent study supports the contention that treatment of the male sexual partner of women with bacterial vaginosis is effective, a general recommendation cannot be made with confidence on the issue of sexual partner treatment until other supporting work is done.

TI  - [Genital infections and the course of pregnancy: a prospective study].
AB  - The reported study investigates the relationship of genital infections, pathobiochemical findings and demographic data to preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and premature delivery. The predictability of chorioamnionitis, puerperal and neonatal infections by these parameters was evaluated concurrently. 301 patients were included in this study between July 1985 and June 1986. 147 of these patients were studied longitudinally during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium (longitudinal group). A second group consisted of 154 women who presented themselves on start of labor to the labor and delivery unit of our Department (peripartal group). The incidence of preterm labor and of PROM was 26%. The incidence of premature delivery, chorioamnionitis, puerperal and neonatal infection was 11.4%, 5.5%, 7.6% and 3% respectively. Cervical colonization with Mycoplasma hominis correlated positively with PROM (relative risk 2.2), premature delivery (3.9) and neonatal infection (6.9). Chorioamnionitis, premature delivery and puerperal infection were also significantly increased in patients with positive vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum cultures during pregnancy and delivery. Premature delivery (2.8) and puerperal infection (4.0) were associated with a vaginal group B-Streptococci (GBS) colonization during pregnancy, as was a positive GBS culture during delivery associated with puerperal infection. Bacterial vaginosis also correlated positively with premature delivery (5.6) and puerperal infection. Preterm labor correlated negatively with the socioeconomic level, PROM correlated negatively with the marital status, positively with age, a history of cervical cerclage, conization or PROM during former pregnancies. Sexual intercourse more often than once weekly during the last month of pregnancy was also associated with an increased number of PROM. Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida and Trichomoniasis during pregnancy and delivery were associated with preterm labor and puerperal infections. Levels of maternal plasma fibrinogen concentrations in patients with PROM were elevated 48 hours after delivery in accordance to the characteristics of acute phase proteins. In contrast, the maternal PMN-granulocyte-elastase concentration was significantly elevated at time of delivery and 24 hours thereafter in those patients who developed puerperal infections. The derived positive predictive value was 26%, the negative 94.7%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the prediction was 83.1%. Six out of seven mothers with neonates treated because of neonatal infection showed significantly elevated plasma concentration of PMN-granulocyte-elastase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis is associated with other sexually transmittable microorganisms in the male urethra.
AB  - In a prospective study, urethral swabs were taken from 544 men presented to an STD clinic, 118 with and 426 without urethritis, and examined by microscope and/or culture for G. vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Candida species and Trichomonas vaginalis. G. vaginalis was isolated from 4.2% of the males with urethritis and from 6.3% of those without urethritis. Using loglinear analysis, the following associations were significant (p less than 0.05): three-way: G. vaginalis, U. urealyticum, C. trachomatis; two-way: G. vaginalis, U. urealyticum and G. vaginalis, M. hominis and U. urealyticum, M. hominis. It is concluded that G. vaginalis is associated with genital mycoplasmas not only in the female, but also in the male urogenital tract.
TI  - Prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in the urinary tract.
AB  - Midstream urine samples from 106 patients presenting to the Casualty Department of The Royal Melbourne Hospital with frequency or dysuria were cultured for Gardnerella vaginalis and conventional uropathogens. Urine samples collected via an open-end catheter from 70 healthy pregnant women were examined similarly. Midstream urine and other samples, including the seminal fluids and swabs of the mouths, throats, rectums, and vaginas of 33 healthy subjects, were cultured for G. vaginalis. Another 15 female patients with proven G. vaginalis bacteriuria were given a bladder washout localization test to determine the site of infection in the urinary tract. G. vaginalis in counts greater than 10(3) CFU/ml was recovered from the midstream urine of 27 of 106 patients (25%), 7 of whom also harbored conventional pathogens in counts greater than 10(4) CFU/ml. Another 11 patients with cultures negative for G. vaginalis yielded greater than 10(4) CFU of conventional pathogens per ml. G. vaginalis was cultured (greater than 10(3) CFU/ml) from catheter samples of 19 of 70 healthy pregnant women (27%), 6 of whom also harbored greater than 10(3) CFU of conventional uropathogens per ml. Two women yielded growths of conventional pathogens only. Midstream urine samples from 13 of 13 healthy males were free of G. vaginalis, whereas 5 of 20 healthy nonpregnant females yielded greater than 10(3) CFU of G. vaginalis per ml from midstream urine samples. G. vaginalis was recovered from 4 of 12 semen samples and from urethral samples from four of seven males and four of eight females. All four culture-positive females also harbored G. vaginalis in their vaginas. There was no evidence of oral or rectal carriage of G. vaginalis in 15 healthy subjects. Localization studies with 15 female patients having underlying renal disease showed that 11 patients harbored G. vaginalis in their kidneys. The result suggest that colonization or infection of the bladder and upper urinary tract by G. vaginalis is very largely a phenomenon of females, with the highest frequency in pregnant women. The prevalence of G. vaginalis in the urinary tracts of healthy females is similar to that of symptomatic subjects. However, G. vaginalis in counts greater than 10(5) CFU/ml is more likely to be associated with urinary tract symptoms. In males, this bacterial species infects the genital tract rather than the urinary tract.
TI  - Neonatal meningitis due to Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - A case of meningitis due to Gardnerella vaginalis occurred in a five-day-old newborn who had clinical signs of fever, polypnea and a grey complexion. After treatment with ampicillin, cefotaxime and netilmicin, the patient's condition improved, and no sequelae were observed. The bacterium isolated from a pure culture of the cerebrospinal fluid was identified by biochemical characteristics to be Gardnerella vaginalis, but it was not possible to define the source and mode of contamination.
TI  - Evaluation of a fluorescent monoclonal antibody reagent for identification of cultured Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - We evaluated a new fluorescent monoclonal antibody reagent for confirmation of identity of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The reagent correctly identified all 161 fresh clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae, which included 11 penicillinase producing strains (PPNG). The reagent also correctly identified 21 stored PPNG strains. No cross reactions were seen with 58 fresh clinical isolates of N. meningitidis, 12 stored strains of N. lactamica, or with strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacilli, Candida spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis or Enterobacteriaceae. Some cross reaction was noted with strains of S. aureus, probably related to cell-wall protein. A. However, this reagent was highly sensitive and specific for use against oxidase positive, gram-negative cocci isolated in London.
TI  - A 24 hour plastic envelope method for isolating and identifying Gardnerella vaginalis (PEM-GVA)
AB  - A new plastic envelope culture test that is selective for Gardnerella vaginalis was compared with a conventional method. Vaginal specimens from 92 women were cultured. Results from both methods were compared with the results of pelvic examinations and clinic screening tests used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV). G vaginalis was isolated more often in the envelope than by the conventional method from patients with BV and those without, though the difference was not significant. Isolation and identification of G vaginalis was completed in 18-24 hours by the envelope method; the conventional method took a mean of 72 hours (range two to six days). Polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) occurred significantly more in specimens from the patients without BV than from those with BV. Both clue cells and a positive amine test reaction were found significantly more in specimens from patients with BV than from those without BV. Clue cells and G vaginalis isolation correlated best with BV (in 47 women), followed by clue cells and positive amine test results (in 39). Adherence of G vaginalis in the envelope also correlated more with BV, clue cells, and positive amine test results (32) than with patients without BV (14). When there were no clue cells and amine test results were negative the results correlated totally with a prediction of no BV. The use of the rapid envelope culture test would have confirmed BV in 20% of the cases where clue cell and amine test results were discordant.

TI  - Clinical and laboratory findings in women with bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis versus controls.
AB  - We report comprehensively on the clinical and laboratory findings in 30 women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), 30 with vaginal trichomoniasis and 30 with normal secretions. Women with trichomoniasis were more often divorced (chi 2 test, p much less than 0.001), more often complained of dyspareunia (chi 2 test, p less than 0.05), frequently had discharge present in the vaginal vestibule, and showed one or more signs of vaginitis in half the cases. A 'moth-eaten' cervix was seen in only four women (13%) with trichomoniasis, but can be considered pathognomonic of the condition. While the main characteristics of vaginal secretions, i.e. amount, consistency, colour, absence or presence of gas and odour, are only poorly discriminative between BV and trichomoniasis, they can be of much help in distinguishing between 'abnormal' and--probably--normal secretions. Parabasal cells were found in the wet mount of 19 women (73%) with trichomoniasis. Epithelial cell clusters were a prominent finding in controls but were virtually absent in the other two groups. We detected curved rods in 15 women (50%) with BV, but in none of the women with trichomoniasis or normal secretions. There were only minor differences in the results of bacterial cultures in cases of BV and trichomoniasis. Bacteroides and Peptostreptococcus species were the predominant anaerobes in both groups. Gardnerella vaginalis was significantly more often isolated from women with BV than from controls (chi 2 test for trend, p less than 0.001). Gas-liquid chromatography showed the presence of succinate in only two cases of BV. Lactate was found in all controls but one. Ethylation of vaginal samples probably reduces the risk of over-emphasizing the presence of succinate and lactate. It is concluded that BV and trichomoniasis are both characterized by the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and that there is a considerable overlap in clinical and laboratory findings. Microscopy of the wet mount should be considered the most powerful diagnostic tool.
TI  - Preterm labor: the role of amnionitis.
AB  - This prospective study represents an attempt to find a link between subclinical intra-amniotic infection and preterm singleton labor in 27 asymptomatic patients with intact membranes. Liquor amnii was obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis and cultured for anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and mycoplasmas. None of these cultures was positive. The value of gas-liquid chromatographic determination of volatile and non-volatile acids in liquor amnii could not be determined because amniotic infections did not occur in the population under study.

AB  - To assess the prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in the community 300 women aged 16-59 were randomly selected from a general practice's age-sex register and invited to attend for a health check. Out of 282 women who were eligible to attend, 192 did so. They were asked whether they had any vaginal symptoms, and swabs were taken from 182 women for culture for G vaginalis. Sixty women were positive for G vaginalis, of whom 26 had symptoms. Infections with G vaginalis may be present in women who have no symptoms. By careful questioning, examination, and side room testing general practitioners may be able to diagnose these infections in such women consulting them for other reasons.
TI  - Establishing a correct diagnosis of vulvovaginal infection.
AB  - Vulvovaginitis is a common problem and a prime reason for physician consultation. The organism most frequently responsible for vulvovaginal infection is Candida albicans, and in a large majority of cases identification of the causative organism and diagnosis are easy to establish. Recurrent or persistent infection, however, presents a perplexing diagnostic problem that usually can be solved with the use of appropriate supportive laboratory tests and awareness of the distinguishing features of the possible etiologic agents. Problems in diagnosis or complications in treatment are usually due to concurrent infection by two or more organisms or to treatment without proper identification of the infectious agents.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis in virginal and sexually active adolescent females: evidence  against exclusive sexual transmission.
AB  - Sixty-eight sexually active and 52 virginal asymptomatic adolescent girls were evaluated for bacterial vaginosis and various laboratory indicators of bacterial vaginosis in a 3-month observational noninterventive study. Sixteen of 120 (13%) subjects had bacterial vaginosis during the study. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis or in the prevalence of isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis between the sexually active and virginal groups. Only a few cases of bacterial vaginosis (one of eight), wet mount clue cells (four of 11), sniff tests (two of eight), and abnormal vaginal fluid succinate/lactate ratios (none of 6) persisted for 3 months in the absence of therapy. These results are discussed in light of several recent reports that suggest using the isolation of G. vaginalis or the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as evidence of sexual abuse in children. It is concluded that bacterial vaginosis should not be considered an exclusively sexually transmitted disease. The presence of the condition is neither proof of sexual activity nor warrants male sexual partner therapy. In addition, therapy seems unwarranted for the incidental finding of bacterial vaginosis in the patient without symptoms.
TI  - Diagnosis and clinical manifestations of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Among 640 randomly selected women who were attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic and did not have trichomoniasis, 33% had bacterial vaginosis as defined by a composite of four clinical criteria: (1) Vaginal discharge was homogeneous; (2) vaginal discharge had a pH greater than or equal to 4.7; (3) vaginal discharge had an amine-like odor when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide; (4) vaginal discharge contained clue cells representing greater than or equal to 20% of vaginal epithelial cells. Previously published Gram stain criteria for bacterial vaginosis correlated better than results of semiquantitative cultures for Gardnerella vaginalis with presence or absence of clue cells and with composite clinical criteria. Of 293 women with bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain criteria, 65% had symptoms of increased vaginal discharge and/or vaginal malodor, while 74% had signs of characteristic homogeneous vaginal discharge or amine-like odor. Elevated vaginal pH was the least specific and amine-like odor the least sensitive sign of bacterial vaginosis. Gram stain criteria for bacterial vaginosis were not associated with the concentrations of endocervical or vaginal inflammatory cells but were significantly associated with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. After adjusting for coinfection, sexual behavior, and other variables, bacterial vaginosis remained associated with adnexal tenderness (odds ratio = 9.2, p = 0.04). Bacterial vaginosis, previously implicated as a risk factor for obstetric infections, may be a risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease.
TI  - Lower genital tract infections in women: comparison of clinical and epidemiologic findings with microbiology.
AB  - We screened 392 women attending the Laboratory of Microbiology of Toulouse Purpan Hospital for symptoms of lower genital tract infection for six microorganisms. Rates of isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida albicans, Mycoplasma hominis, and Gardnerella vaginalis were 1%, 7.7%, 29.8%, 23.8%, and 37.5%, respectively. Trichomonas vaginalis was detected by direct examination in specimens from 3.1% of patients. Another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of these microorganisms in relation to clinical and epidemiologic findings. C. trachomatis was isolated significantly more often from patients under 25 year old (P less than 0.001), from those who use oral contraceptives (P less than 0.01), from those who have a male sexual partner with symptoms of sexually transmitted disease (P less than 0.001), and from those who present signs of cervicitis (P less than 0.05). Isolation of C. albicans was significantly associated with vulvar pruritus (P less than 0.01), vulvitis (P less than 0.01), and vaginitis (P less than 0.001). G. vaginalis and M. hominis are significantly associated with bacterial vaginosis (P less than 0.001). This syndrome was diagnosed clinically in 27.2% of our study population and was highly correlated with use of an intrauterine device (P less than 0.05).

TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis in the urinary tract: incidence and significance in a hospital population.
AB  - The significance of Gardnerella vaginalis in urine was studied by comparing urine culture results, urinalysis data, and clinical findings. Over a two-year period, G vaginalis was reported in 2.3% of all urine cultures. Of 72 patients with pure cultures (greater than 10(4) cfu/mL), 43 patients (59.7%) were found to have G vaginalis urinary tract infections. Furthermore, four of the infected patients had pyelonephritis. Symptoms associated with G vaginalis urinary tract infections varied, and pyuria was detected in only 58% of the cases. Conditions associated with G vaginalis urinary tract infection included a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and/or instrumentation and upper urinary tract disease.
TI  - Meningismus as main symptom in toxic shock syndrome.
AB  - A case of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) with meningismus as main symptom is presented. The case illustrates that, in cases of rigidity of the neck and back, not directly explainable, TSS should be considered as a possible diagnosis. Toxic syndrome (TSS) is a severe, acute infectious disease with great variations in symptomatology (1,2). Its lethality is approximately 5% (3). The prognosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Descriptive light and electron microscopy of normal and clue-cell-positive discharge.
AB  - In women with clue-cell-positive discharge (CCPD), light-microscopical examination of the wet mount suggests a preference of bacteria for certain vaginal epithelial cells (VECs). To investigate this further, a light- and electron-microscopical study of patients and healthy controls was performed, with special emphasis on vitality and glycogen content of VECs and bacterial-epithelial cell interaction. Our study did not reveal morphologic differences between VECs of patients and controls. There was, however, a significant decrease in the percentages of vital and glycogen-containing VECs in CCPD (p less than 0.001), probably caused by an overgrowth of (anaerobic) bacteria. In CCPD vaginal bacteria preferably colonize vital VECs. This could account for the relatively low percentage of clue cells in this condition.
TI  - Prevalence of lower genital tract infections in pregnancy.
AB  - A descriptive profile of 106 pregnant women with various forms of cervicitis and  vaginitis is provided. Fifty women attending individual physicians' private offices are compared with 56 clinic patients: 34 attending a university prenatal teaching clinic and 22 attending a pregnancy termination unit. Univariate analysis showed that single women were significantly more likely to be infected by mycoplasmas, yeasts, trichomonads, and Gardnerella vaginalis than were married women. Teenagers were more frequently infected by Mycoplasma hominis, yeasts, and Trichomonas vaginalis than were women older than 20 years. After stepwise logistic regression analysis, the most significant predictor of infection with M. hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, or yeasts was being a clinic patient; for G. vaginalis, the most significant variable was being unmarried. These data suggest that teenaged and single women who are pregnant will benefit most from routine screening for vaginitis/cervicitis-producing microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of tinidazole given as a single dose and on 2 consecutive days for the treatment of nonspecific bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Nonspecific bacterial vaginosis, defined as the presence of clue cells, was treated in a randomized, double-blind study with (1) tinidazole 2 g as a single dose (82 patients), (2) tinidazole 2 g on 2 consecutive days (84 patients), and (3) with placebo (81 patients). The cure rates, both clue cells and Gardnerella vaginalis absent, were 51, 74 and 4%, respectively. A closer clinical and microbiological evaluation showed the 2-day regimen to be superior.
TI  - Trospectomycin, a novel spectinomycin analogue: antibacterial activity and preliminary human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - Trospectomycin (TSP; U-63366F) is a novel spectinomycin (SP) analogue with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in vitro activity of the analogue was compared to that of SP against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. The in vivo activity of the compound was assessed using experimental infection models for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative facultative bacteria. The preliminary human pharmacokinetics of TSP were evaluated following single-dose i.v. or i.m. administration. TSP was more active in vitro than SP (2 to 32-fold) against strains of numerous bacterial species, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus spp., Bacteroides spp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Chlamydia trachomatis. The activity of TSP for most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of SP. TSP was more active than SP (2 to 32-fold) in curing experimental infections due to streptococci, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. TSP was well-absorbed following both i.v. and i.m. administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis of microbiological assay data for the 1000 mg dose yielded the following mean values for the i.v. and i.m. routes, respectively: Cmax = 81.2, 28.7 micrograms/ml; serum half-life = 2.2, 2.2 h; Tmax = 25, 75 min; and AUC = 156.6, 116.2 h micrograms/ml. Pharmacokinetic analysis of assay data derived using the more sensitive HPLC assay revealed the biphasic nature of trospectomycin elimination, highlighted by a short apparent serum half-life (2.2 h) and a prolonged tissue half-life (approximately 36 h). TSP inhibits a variety of clinically important organisms, including agents of sexually transmitted diseases and pelvic inflammatory disease, and demonstrates favourable pharmacokinetic properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Cervico-vaginal pathogens and contraception: microbiological observations].
AB  - The authors relate the results about 172 vaginal and cervical swabs, in women with or without oral/local (IUD) contraception, with or without vaginosis/vaginitis. Gardnerella vaginalis was always prevalent; the authors observed an high correlation between cervical IUD and vaginal Gardnerella, more than IUD and cervical Chlamydia trachomatis. Bacterial associations in Gardnerella vaginalis (Mobiluncus, obligate anaerobes) are related; incidence of Candida and Trichomonas vaginalis are reported; correlation between these microbial agents and contraception are discussed.
TI  - Single-dose therapy for genitourinary infections.
AB  - Single-dose therapy for selected genitourinary tract infections is an effective alternative to multiple-dose regimens. Candidal vulvovaginitis and trichomonal vaginitis may be routinely treated with single-dose regimens. With acute cystitis, candidates for single-dose therapy include patients who have a short duration of symptoms and are likely to comply with follow-up.
TI  - A review of the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against genital pathogens.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of roxithromycin against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Treponema pallidum, Gardnerella vaginalis and Haemophilus ducreyi is reviewed. Roxithromycin demonstrated equivalent activity to erythromycin against N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. hominis, U. urealyticum, G. vaginalis and H. ducreyi. In a rabbit model for syphilis, potentially useful activity against T. pallidum has been demonstrated.
TI  - Roxithromycin in nongonococcal urethritis.
AB  - This presentation is a summary of five different studies on the efficacy and tolerance of roxithromycin in the treatment of non-gonococcal genital infections. Three of the studies were double-blind comparative and two were open studies. Of the 924 out-patients whose data were analysed for clinical efficacy, 637 received treatment with roxithromycin 150 mg bd. The standard dose of roxithromycin, 150 mg bd for ten days, was compared with doxycycline 200 mg daily, lymecycline 300 mg bd and roxithromycin 450 mg once daily. The overall clinical success rate was 90% (576 of 637 patients) for roxithromycin 150 mg bd. In the three comparative trials, no significant difference was found between the clinical success rates of roxithromycin 150 mg bd and the other drugs. The overall clinical success rate with roxithromycin 150 mg bd was 92% (512/558) in nongonococcal urethritis and 81% (64/79) in cervicovaginitis. Taking into account all patients treated with roxithromycin 150 mg bd, the bacteriological success rate was 90% (444/492). In the comparative trials, no significant difference could be found between the treatment groups. Roxithromycin 150 mg bd was effective in eradicating 97% (308/316) of the isolates of Chlamydia trachomatis, 88% (149/170) of Ureaplasma urealyticum, 73% (40/55) of Mycoplasma hominis and 57% (13/23) of Gardnerella vaginalis. The present findings show that a high cure rate can be achieved with a ten-day course of treatment with roxithromycin and that it is at least as effective as the tetracyclines commonly used in the treatment of nongonococcal urethritis. A higher dosage than 300 mg/day of roxithromycin did not offer any clear advantage in terms of efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis: microbiological and clinical findings.
AB  - A prospective study was performed involving 101 women who consecutively attended  a primary health care unit for complaints of genital malodour and/or abnormal vaginal discharge. Bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 34 women on the basis of four diagnostic criteria: vaginal pH greater than 4.7, homogeneous vaginal discharge, a positive amine test and clue cells. The sensitivity of these criteria was greater than 90% except for homogeneous discharge (82%). Their specificity was greater than 90% except for vaginal pH greater than 4.7 (46%); a specificity of 87% could have been achieved by using the criterion for vaginal pH greater than or equal to 5.0. There was a strong association between diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and the concomitant occurrence of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp. and Bacteroides spp. There was no difference between women with or without bacterial vaginosis as regards contraception methods (except for use of an intrauterine device), age at first intercourse, or earlier episodes of vaginal discharge. Sexual transmission of the predominant bacteria was not supported by data collected from the male consorts.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis chorioamnionitis: a report of two cases and a review of the pathogenic role of G. vaginalis in obstetrics.
AB  - Two patients with chorioamnionitis due to Gardnerella vaginalis are described. Institution of tocolytic therapy for preterm labor is associated with maternal complications of septic hypotension and pulmonary edema in one patient. Diagnostic modalities, specifically culturing techniques, are discussed, as well as suspected pathophysiologic mechanisms.
TI  - Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis in pure culture from the uterine cavity of patients with irregular bleedings.
AB  - Hysterectomy was performed in three patients because of persistent irregular vaginal bleeding. Before the operation samples were taken from the cervical os for cultivation of Gardnerella vaginalis, yeasts, viruses, Chlamydia trachomatis, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Immediately after the operation, the uterus was opened under sterile conditions and samples obtained from the isthmus and fundus of the uterine cavity were examined microbiologically. In all three patients G. vaginalis was grown in pure culture from the fundus. Serum antibody titres against G. vaginalis were significantly raised in all three patients, and histology revealed mononuclear cells in the endometrium. The isolation of G. vaginalis from the endometrium of patients with clinical and histological signs of inflammation and with antibodies to G. vaginalis in serum indicates that the organism may play a causative role in endometritis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the two new oral cephalosporin metabolites RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074.
AB  - A total of 629 clinical strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were  tested for their susceptibility to RO 19-5247, RO 15-8074, and other antimicrobial agents. Both RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had good activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae; however, resistance was found among some strains of Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Morganella spp. Both compounds showed moderate to poor active against Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. Against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococci (not enterococci), each compound was highly active in vitro. RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had comparable activity to cotrimoxazole, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime. Each new compound had considerably better activity then did cefaclor and amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate.
TI  - Detection of Gardnerella vaginalis in vaginal specimens by direct immunofluorescence.
AB  - The preparation of a fluorescein-labeled Gardnerella vaginalis polyclonal antibody is described, and its usefulness is assessed for the detection of this microorganism in vaginal samples obtained from 263 women attending the gynecological department of a general hospital, 66 of whom harbored an intrauterine device. The direct immunofluorescence technique was positive for G. vaginalis in 21% of the specimens, whereas only 12.5% of the total bacteriological cultures were positive. The frequency was higher in patients harboring intrauterine devices since 34.8% exhibited positive immunofluorescence and 30.3% exhibited positive cultures.
TI  - Cervical mosaic and an integrated pathophysiological approach to early cervical neoplasia.
AB  - The increasing concern for the early detection and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) set up the basis for this study, which also considers some epidemiological factors which seem to be related to the genesis of an abnormal uterine cervical colposcopic pattern, the mosaic pattern. We have observed that women with a mosaic pattern show an increasing frequency of premalignant and/or malignant histologic changes up to 40 years of age which then falls abruptly. Sterility and hirsutism were frequent associations, these features suggesting an abnormal hormonal status. An association with infection by Gardnerella vaginalis (15.3%) was noted, and dysplasia increased in frequency to 53% when G. vaginalis was associated with mosaic. Also, 67.25% of women with mosaic showed other concomitant diseases of allergic, immunologic, or infectious type. Based upon these observations, and in an attempt to explain further interrelationships among several factors in the pathogenesis of CIN, an integrated hypothesis which may lead to new therapeutic avenues, both in the prevention and treatment of early cervical cancer, is advanced.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis in prepubertal girls.
AB  - A prospective study was established to determine the significance of the isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis from the vagina in prepubertal children. Two hundred fifty-six children were enrolled. Group 1 consisted of 137 children who had been victims of sexual abuse; group 2, forty-eight children with genitourinary complaints and no history of sexual abuse; and group 3, seventy-one children with no genitourinary complaints and no history of sexual abuse. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from 20 patients (14.6%) in group 1 and five (4.2%) of 119 control patients from groups 2 and 3. Within group 1, G vaginalis was more likely to be isolated from children with a history of multiple episodes of sexual abuse than those with a single episode. Gardnerella vaginalis was not associated with any other historical, physical, or laboratory findings, including vaginal erythema or vaginal discharge.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis infection. Clinical aspects, diagnosis and therapy].
AB  - The Gardnerella vaginalis-infection of the urogenital tract is of clinical importance in females and of epidemiological importance in males. Females suffer from Bacterial Vaginosis, with a foul-smelling grey vaginal discharge with a pH of 5.0-5.5 which contains "clue cells", and from Sepsis. The isolation and identification of G. vaginalis i necessary in man. If G. vaginalis-infection is suspected, simultaneous infections with further STD-agents such as N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis etc should be excluded. Metronidazole (1 g/day for 5 days) is the drug of choice in G. vaginalis-infection.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of trypticase soy broth with and without gelatin and yeast  extract in the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - The addition of gelatin to blood culture media has been suggested to prevent the  inhibition of Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius that is caused by sodium polyanetholsulfonate. To determine the effect of such supplementation on the overall yield of microorganisms, we compared the yield and speed of detection of clinically important microorganisms from 5422 paired 10-ml samples of blood cultured in Trypticase soy broth (TSB) containing 0.03% sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) and TSB/SPS containing 1.2% gelatin and 1.0% yeast extract (mTSB). The atmosphere of incubation (open venting unit) and ratio of blood to broth (1:5) were the same for both samples. Only cultures with adequate blood sample (greater than or equal to 80% of stated volume) were compared statistically. Addition of gelatin and yeast extract resulted in inhibited growth of Enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.01), fungi (p less than 0.05), and the overall set of microorganisms encountered (p less than 0.001). It delayed growth of Enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001) but reduced the time to recover staphylococci (p less than 0.02). Of 12 isolates of species usually inhibited by SPS, seven grew only with the addition of gelatin and yeast extract, none grew only without supplementation, and five grew in both media. Although gelatin and yeast extract may improve the yield of some specific bacteria, the routine use of these additives cannot be recommended for all blood culture media.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of modified radiometric blood culture medium supplemented with gelatin for detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - Although the addition of 1.2% gelatin to broth blood culture media containing sodium polyanetholesulfonate has been shown to enhance detection of certain bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis, the effect of such supplementation on the detection of other microorganisms causing bacteremia and fungemia is not known. Therefore, we studied BACTEC 6B medium with and without gelatin in 6,833 paired comparisons to examine the effects of supplementation on both the yield and the speed of detection of sepsis. More aerobic and facultative bacteria grew in the 6B than in the 6B-gelatin medium (P less than 0.001), especially staphylococci (P less than 0.01), Escherichia coli (P less than 0.01), other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0.05), and Acinetobacter spp. (P less than 0.05). When microorganisms grew in both bottles, they did so earlier in 6B than in 6B-gelatin (P less than 0.001). We conclude that the 6B medium in its present formulation is superior to 6B medium supplemented with 1.2% gelatin.
TI  - Haemagglutination and tissue culture adhesion of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Six strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were studied to examine the adhesin-receptor mechanism involved in their attachment to human red blood cells and an epithelial tissue culture cell line (McCoy). The adhesins involved in the attachment of the bacteria to each of these cells were proteinaceous but showed marked differences after various chemical or physical treatments, indicating that separate adhesins were present. Haemagglutinating strains were more hydrophobic than tissue-culture-adherent strains. Haemagglutination of human red blood cells by strains of G. vaginalis was inhibited by galactose, lactose, N-acetylneuraminic acid and phosphatidylserine. In contrast, the tissue-culture adherence of strains was not inhibited by these substances.
TI  - Microbiologic and serologic studies of Gardnerella vaginalis in intra-amniotic infection.
AB  - Our objective was to investigate the role of Gardnerella vaginalis in intra-amniotic infection by use of comparative, quantitative cultures on selective media and by detection of maternal antibody response. Amniotic fluid was collected from patients with intra-amniotic infection and from matched control women. In addition to media for aerobes, anaerobes, and mycoplasmas, we used V agar-selective (Remel, Lenexa, KS) to isolate G vaginalis. Acute and convalescent maternal sera were collected and assayed for antibodies by a microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) prepared against whole cells of G vaginalis. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in the amniotic fluid of 24 (28%) of the 86 patients with intra-amniotic infection, but this was not significantly different from the isolation rate in amniotic fluid of 86 matched controls (21%). No patient exhibited G vaginalis bacteremia. The ELISA performed on paired sera of selected patients showed that 25 had intra-amniotic infection (eight G vaginalis-positive, 17 negative), and 18 were asymptomatic (seven G vaginalis-positive, 11 negative). The amount of G vaginalis antibodies detected by ELISA in acute sera was similar in all four groups. Mean changes during convalescence were small (.053-.084 optical density units) and not significantly different. Although G vaginalis is found commonly in amniotic fluid of patients with intra-amniotic infection, the data do not support a pathogenic role for this organism; however, a facilitating role in polymicrobial infection cannot be excluded.

AB  - Vaginal washings of 22 patients with vaginitis, 11 with vaginosis, and 12 healthy subjects were investigated quantitatively and qualitatively for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and yeasts. Gardnerella vaginalis was recovered from 9 of the vaginitis patients, 7 of the vaginosis patients, and 4 of the asymptomatic subjects. Obligate anaerobes were found in 11 of the vaginitis patients, 4 of the vaginosis patients, and none of the control subjects. Bacteroides bivius was the anaerobe most frequently isolated from symptomatic subjects. Anaerobic vibrios were recovered twice from symptomatic subjects. The counts for Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes when present were generally very high. The most frequent aerobes were beta-hemolytic streptococci (group B) and staphylococci.

TI  - Development and evaluation of scheme for serotyping Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Antibodies to Gardnerella vaginalis were raised in rabbits. Nine antisera that reacted with their immunising strains, but not with the remaining eight strains, were used to develop a serotyping scheme. A dot blotting technique was used, and complexes of antigen and antibody were visualised using anti-rabbit immunoglobulin linked to alkaline phosphatase. Of 91 clinical isolates used to evaluate the scheme, 79 (87%) were typable and 52 (57%) reacted with only a single antiserum. The antigens expressed were stable during growth on different media and on subculture. The specificity of the antibody was shown to be directed against different immunodominant proteins and possibly a carbohydrate.
TI  - The midcycle cervical microbial flora as studied by the weighed-swab method, and  its possible correlation with results of sperm cervical mucus penetration tests.
AB  - Infertile couples undergoing routine investigation for infertility were randomly  selected for the study. A quantitative method using weighed swabs was found satisfactory for the study of microbial flora in the midcycle cervical mucus. In 6 of the 20 women, the midcycle cervical mucus was hostile in the sperm cervical mucus penetration tests. The total bacterial counts and the number of species (average, 2.5) isolated from the hostile mucus were significantly greater than those from the receptive mucus (average, 1.3). Only normal vaginal/cervical flora was isolated. Ureaplasma urealyticum was found more frequently in patients undergoing clomiphene citrate therapy (6/10 versus 0/9, P less than 0.03, Fischer's Exact test).
TI  - Pili on Gardnerella vaginalis studied by electronmicroscopy.
AB  - Fourteen recently isolated strains and two laboratory strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were examined by electronmicroscopy for the presence of pili. All strains isolated recently from both men and women were heavily pilated. In contrast only a few pili were seen on organisms of the two laboratory strains, with many of the organisms having no pili. The importance of multiple subculture in this loss was supported by the observation that the degree of pilation of one freshly isolated strain decreased on repeated subculture. Other findings suggested that this was probably due to gradual loss of pili and not to selection of organisms that were non-pilate originally.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis to metronidazole, its bioactive metabolites, and tinidazole.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 510 clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis to metronidazole, its principal oxidative metabolites, and tinidazole were determined by an agar dilution method. The hydroxy metabolite was the most active, with an MIC90 value (minimum concentration that inhibited 90% of the strains) of 1.12 mg/L (5.51 mumol/L). Tinidazole and metronidazole were somewhat less active, with MIC90s of 4.09 mg/L (23.9 mumol/L) and 4.44 mg/L (18.0 mumol/L), respectively. The acid metabolite was inactive, with an MIC90 value of 226.55 mg/L (1.22 mmol/L). These results suggest that the hydroxy metabolite of metronidazole may contribute significantly to the antimicrobial effect of the parent drug in G. vaginalis-associated infections.
TI  - Treatment of clue cell-positive discharge with 200 mg povidone-iodine pessaries.  A double-blind and placebo-controlled trial.
AB  - In a double-blind randomized study we evaluated the efficacy of povidone-iodine in the treatment of clue cell-positive discharge (CCPD). Vaginal pessaries (200 mg povidone-iodine or placebo) were taken twice daily for five consecutive days. Although the regimen was reasonably well accepted, 'messiness' was reported by 13 of 33 women (39%). Of 44 women enrolled, treatment efficacy was evaluated in 28 women who had both follow-up visits. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of povidone-iodine and placebo pessaries, at either the first or the second follow-up visit (p values 0.46 and 1 respectively). It is concluded that the use of povidone-iodine pessaries, at least in the regimen described, cannot be regarded as an effective therapy for CCPD.
TI  - Incidence of motile, curved anaerobic rods (Mobiluncus species) in vaginal secretions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic cultures as well as a Gram stain and wet mount preparation  were made of vaginal swabs taken from various groups of women including those with vaginal discharge. The bacteria commonly found in cultures were lactobacilli, coryneforms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and facultative streptococci. Anaerobes were isolated from 75% (475 of 632) of specimens. The incidence of Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus species in the five groups of women varied from 2.2-5.1%, 11.5-35.7%, 23.3-36.7% and 20.0-34.8% respectively. Except for Candida species, differences in the prevalence of these organisms between the groups of women were not significant. The isolation rates of Candida species in women attending the antenatal clinic and staff health clinic were significantly higher than women in the other groups. Mobiluncus species were found to occur either with T. vaginalis, Candida species or G. vaginalis alone or with any two or with all three or in the absence of these organisms. However, the incidence of Mobiluncus species was significantly higher in women colonized with G. vaginalis (112 of 185, or 60.5%) compared with women not infected (47 of 477, or 9.8%). Also, Mobiluncus species occurred in large numbers when found in the presence of G. vaginalis. When found without G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus species occurred in much smaller numbers. As with G. vaginalis, Mobiluncus species also occurred concomitantly with certain anaerobes, mainly Bacteroides species and peptostreptococci.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis in the male upper genital tract: a possible source of reinfection of the female partner.
AB  - We describe a case of Gardnerella vaginalis colonization of the upper genital tract of the male partner of a woman with recurring bacterial vaginosis. G. vaginalis could not be cultured from the urethra but was cultured from semen. After treatment of the male partner with metronidazole, the woman had no more relapses of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  - Significant bacteremia associated with replacement of intrauterine contraceptive  device.
AB  - Blood culture samples were taken from 23 women at different stages when an intrauterine contraceptive device was replaced. Transient bacteremia resulting from vaginal organisms was found in 13% of women 4 to 6 minutes after insertion of the new device. Previous reports have failed to demonstrate bacteremia associated with either first insertion or removal of intrauterine contraceptive device. Our results show that replacement of an intrauterine contraceptive device, a more traumatic procedure, causes significant bacteremia, and chemoprophylaxis should be given to patients in the groups at risk.
TI  - Infection with multiple sexually transmitted agents.
AB  - A patient named as a contact by an individual with gonorrhea and syphilis was found to be an asymptomatic carrier of seven organisms known to be transmitted sexually. Cultures were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Herpes simplex virus. Trichomonas vaginalis was detected by a wet preparation and the Papanicolaou smear. The cervix was found to have an ulcer on the posterior lip that yielded Herpes simplex on culture. Although the venereal disease reaction level (VDRL) and the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption tests (FTA-ABS) were negative, and treponemes were not identified on dark-field microscopy, a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction on this patient raised the possibility that she also had incubating syphilis.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of niridazole on Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Niridazole, a nitrothiazole derivative, demonstrated powerful antimicrobial activity against 510 clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis tested. MIC's ranged from 0.002 to 1.0 mg/l with MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.02 and 0.067 mg/l respectively.
TI  - The acute urethral syndrome in routine practice.
AB  - Midstream samples of urine from 185 acutely dysuric women and 89 symptom-free controls were screened according to the modified criteria of Kass by both conventional and microaerophilic culture. Among the 185 symptomatic women, coliform bacilli were isolated from 125 (67.5%) and in 45 (36%) of the latter the concentration of these organisms in the urine was less than 10(8)/l. Fastidious organisms were isolated in pure and mixed cultures from 25 (13.4%) of the 185 patients and from 4 (4.5%) of 89 controls. Staphylococcus species were isolated from 10.8% (9.7% S. saprophyticus; 1.1% S. epidermidis) and Ureaplasma urealyticum from 2.7%. All patients infected with conventional organisms but only 30.4% of those yielding fastidious organisms had pyuria. The isolation rate of fastidious organisms tended to be higher (P = 0.055) in symptomatic women that in symptom-free controls.
TI  - Comparison of 2 g single dose of metronidazole, nimorazole and tinidazole in the  treatment of vaginitis associated with Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Vaginitis associated with the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis (confirmed by culture) was treated either with metronidazole or with one of the two nitroimidazole derivatives; nimorazole or tinidazole, as a single oral 2 g dose. Eighty-two patients were treated with metronidazole, 100 with nimorazole and 98 with tinidazole. The cure rates were 79%, 88% and 92% with metronidazole, nimorazole and tinidazole respectively. Therefore we recommend a single dose of 2 g of any of these three drugs in the treatment of such infection.
TI  - The accuracy of colposcopically directed biopsy in diagnosis of CIN.
AB  - During the last decade there has been an increasing interest in the use of the colposcope. A quality-control study for the evaluation and understanding of the limitations of cytology and colposcopy in our clinic is presented. The results in 132 patients are analysed and compared to previous reports from the literature. Cytologic results correlated with the histological diagnosis only in 47% of the patients. Colposcopically directed biopsies were accurate in 88.8% when the entire squamocolumnar junction was visualized. The accuracy of the directed biopsies in patients with unsatisfactory colposcopy was 58.3%. In the presence of a Gardnerella vaginalis cervicitis the colposcopic accuracy decreased to 70.9%.

TI  - Salpingitis; aspects of diagnosis and etiology: a 4-year study from a Swedish capital hospital.
AB  - 359 patients underwent laparoscopy to verify the diagnosis of salpingitis. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was found in 187 (52%) cases. Laparoscopy revealed normal conditions in 136 (37%) cases. Other diseases were diagnosed in 36 (10%) cases. Bacteriological cultures from the fimbrial lumen were positive in 24% of the PID cases. Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) was detected in 12%, Bacteroides species (BS) in 5%, Actinomyces israelii (AI) in 3%, Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) in 2%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in 1%, and Ureaplasma urealyticum (UU) in 1%. Cervical cultures were positive for NG and/or CT in 71% of the PID cases but only in 19% of the non-PID cases. From these no positive intra-abdominal cultures were detected. Serological tests for CT were carried out. A positive acute titre of greater than or equal to 1/64 was noted in 37%, a seroconversion (X4) 2-3 weeks later was found in 14%. Positive serology despite a negative culture was registered in 19%.
TI  - Susceptibility of Mobiluncus species to 23 antimicrobial agents and 15 other compounds.
AB  - The susceptibility of 12 strains of Mobiluncus curtisii and 10 strains of M. mulieris to 23 antimicrobial agents and 15 other compounds was determined. All strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, rifampin, tobramycin, vancomycin, virginiamycin, and all beta-lactam antibiotics tested, including imipenem. One strain of M. mulieris was resistant to erythromycin and josamycin. All were resistant to colistin, cycloserine, nalidixic acid, and neomycin. Tetracycline had variable activity. All M. curtisii strains were resistant to metronidazole and its hydroxy metabolite. Of 10 M. mulieris strains, 5 were resistant to metronidazole and 2 were resistant to its hydroxy metabolite. All 12 M. curtisii and 1 of 10 M. mulieris strains were resistant to tinidazole. M. curtisii and M. mulieris produced two mutually exclusive clusters of MICs when tested against ampicillin, cefoxitin, cephalothin, moxalactam, alizarin red, Evans blue, and sodium fluoride. Gardnerella vaginalis was more susceptible to Nile blue A than was either M. curtisii or M. mulieris. Clindamycin and imipenem may be useful agents in the therapy of metronidazole-resistant bacterial vaginosis. Metronidazole, tinidazole, and Nile blue A may be of value in the development of a selective agar for Mobiluncus species.

TI  - Evaluation of enzyme immunoassay (Chlamydiazyme) for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis in genital tract specimens.
AB  - An enzyme immunoassay (Chlamydiazyme) for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis was evaluated on genital specimens from 96 men and 272 women attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases (STD clinic). Compared with a direct immunofluorescence test for chlamydial elementary bodies, the enzyme immunoassay had a sensitivity of 58% on specimens from men, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 93%, and a negative predictive value of 88%; the assay had a sensitivity of 67% on specimens from women, a specificity of 89%, a positive predictive value of 63% and a negative predictive value of 90%. Immunofluorescence provided the most stringent test for the performance of the enzyme immunoassay as values were improved a little when a cell culture procedure was used for comparison. Further evidence for the lack of sensitivity was the detection of elementary bodies, sometimes in large numbers, in the enzyme immunoassay buffer of 13 of 19 specimens that had given a negative enzyme immunoassay result and the finding in comparative titrations of four laboratory strains that the enzyme immunoassay was at least 100-fold less able to detect chlamydiae than either immunofluorescence or the cell culture procedure. Lack of specificity may be associated with the finding that the enzyme immunoassay antibody reacted with strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Escherichia coli, Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and group B streptococci. The enzyme immunoassay was not considered to be sufficiently sensitive, specific, or reproducible for routine use.
TI  - Clinical prediction of Gardnerella vaginalis in general practice.
AB  - In a study of 162 women with vaginal symptoms the clinical features of increased  discharge, yellow discharge, 'high cheese' odour and pH greater than 5 were statistically strongly associated with the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, confirmed by microbiological culture. The sensitivities and specificities of these clinical tests, although not as high as those of previously described sideroom tests using the amine test and microscopy for 'clue cells' nevertheless allow the clinician to predict G. vaginalis reliably and initiate treatment at first consultation.
TI  - Non-specific (anaerobic) vaginitis: relevance of clinical and laboratory studies  in a practice population.
AB  - Non-specific vaginitis is a commonly diagnosed condition defined in a similar manner by most authors. Although assumed to be of infective aetiology, no single organism has yet been accepted as the primary agent. This syndrome was studied in two groups of women presenting to general practitioners or attending a family planning clinic. The two groups were of similar ages and had similar markers of sexual activity. Of the 173 women studied, 90 had symptoms. Of the symptomatic women 9.5% could be categorized as having non-specific vaginitis and 36.7% as having an alternative cause for their discharge. Gardnerella vaginalis were found to be associated with anaerobes, clue cells and staphylococci more frequently than by chance.The isolation of G. vaginalis or anaerobes was assessed for their ability to help confirm the diagnosis of non-specific vaginitis and to distinguish this from other possible pathology. In patients with clinical non-specific vaginitis, the isolation of G. vaginalis proved the most sensitive (100%) though not a very specific (77.4%) indicator, whereas anaerobes were more specific (93.2%). The presence of anaerobes was a better predictor of non-specific vaginitis (30.8%) than G. vaginalis (18.9%). It was concluded that providing laboratory facilities specifically for the isolation of G. vaginalis would be of little benefit to the general practitioner in diagnosing non-specific vaginitis since it would add to the cost of processing specimens, whereas reporting the presence of heavy growths of anaerobes provides some confirmation and adds little to the cost.
TI  - In vitro adhesiveness and biotype of Gardnerella vaginalis strains in relation to the occurrence of clue cells in vaginal discharges.
AB  - Haemagglutination and tissue culture adherence tests using a McCoy cell line were used to examine the adherence characteristics of 105 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Each strain represented one isolate per patient. For each patient, a direct smear of vaginal discharge was examined for clue cells. The relation between in vitro adherence and the presence of clue cells was examined. There seemed to be no appreciable relation between the presence of clue cells in smears and the haemagglutinating activity of strains. In contrast, adherence as judged by the McCoy tissue culture system showed a significant relation to the presence of clue cells (p less than 0.001). Though both adhesive characteristics were not inhibited by mannose, the mechanism of haemagglutination of human red cells appeared to differ from that of adherence of tissue culture cells. The findings imply that the clue cell phenomenon is due to attachment of adherent strains of G vaginalis to epithelial cells. Adherent strains of G vaginalis may play a part in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. There were 33 cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides sp., 54; Bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented Bacteroides, 12; Bacteroides disiens, 11; Fusobacterium, 13; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; Gardnerella vaginalis, 29; Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and Escherichia coli, five. Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. One treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. The cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. The third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of the Vitek Neisseria-Haemophilus Identification card.
AB  - A clinical evaluation of the Vitek Neisseria-Haemophilus Identification (NHI) card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) was performed with 480 clinical isolates and stock strains of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp., and other fastidious microorganisms included in the data base of the system. Identifications obtained with the NHI card were compared with those determined by conventional methods. The card identified 83.2% of 244 Neisseria spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis, 54.9% of 164 Haemophilus spp., and 84.7% of 72 fastidious gram-negative species with no further testing required. Some isolates produced good confidence-marginal separation identifications, in which the correct identification was listed with one or two other possible identifications and extra tests were required and suggested. When isolates producing good confidence-marginal separation identifications were included, correct identifications of these organism groups increased to 97.1, 92.7, and 94.4%, respectively. Among the commonly isolated microorganisms, the NHI card identified 99.1% of 110 N. gonorrhoeae, 98.5% of 68 N. meningitidis, 93.9% of 98 H. influenzae, and 95.6% of 46 H. parainfluenzae strains. All of these organisms produced excellent to very good confidence level identifications except for H. influenzae biotypes II, III, and VII, for which hemolytic reactions were required for differentiation from H. haemolyticus. The NHI card reliably identified other fastidious gram-negative species, including H. aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Kingella denitrificans.
TI  - Single dose of ornidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of excessive and foul smelling vaginal discharge. In the group of 24 women, the diagnosis was based on increased vaginal discharge, positive KOH-test, and detection of clue cells in the wet smear. In the microbiological isolation, Gardnerella vaginalis was also observed in 20 subjects and mixed anaerobic flora in all the 24 subjects. A single dose of 1.5 g of ornidazole was given. Posttreatment control was performed 7 to 28 days later. Gardnerella vaginalis was present in 2 (cure rate 90%) and anaerobes in 4 subjects (cure rate 83%). Subjective improvement occurred in 96% of patients. Side effects, the most common of them being dizziness, after ornidazole treatment were observed by 17 (71%) of subjects.

TI  - The role of vaginal secretory immunoglobulin A, Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, and Chlamydia trachomatis in postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - In a prospective study of 129 women undergoing induced first-trimester abortion,  14 (10.9%) contracted postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Samples of vaginal secretion for quantitation of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) as well as isolates from cervix/urethra for the culture of anaerobes and aerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis et melaninogenicus and Gardnerella vaginalis, were obtained at the preoperative visit. Two blood samples from each woman with postabortal PID were analysed for antibodies against G. vaginalis. Twenty-five per cent of women with a history of PID developed postabortal PID, and 25% with vaginitis contracted postabortal infection (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.005). Twenty-five per cent of women harboring C. trachomatis at the time of abortion developed infection. The presence of anaerobes or G. vaginalis was not associated with the frequency of postabortal PID (all p-values greater than 0.1). One woman with postabortal PID produced a culture positive for G. vaginalis and a rise in specific antibody titer. The levels of vaginal sIgA were not significantly associated with a positive history of PID (p greater than 0.6), with postabortal PID (p greater than 0.4) or with the presence of anaerobes or G. vaginalis at the time of abortion (p greater than 0.3). However, significantly elevated levels of sIgA were found in women harboring C. trachomatis (p less than 0.05). Thus, the study could not demonstrate any correlation between vaginal sIgA and PID, but increased sIgA in Chlamydia-positive women. A history of PID and vaginitis entailed a significant risk of contracting postabortal PID.
TI  - Non-specific vaginitis or vaginitis of undetermined aetiology.
AB  - Vaginitis is a complex syndrome that is probably the most common outpatient disease seen by the gynaecologist. The specific aetiologies of vaginitis are many. One of the most common entities, however, is "non-specific vaginitis" which can be subdivided into: Gardnerella vaginitis, anaerobic vaginosis, and vaginitis of undetermined aetiology. The role of Gardnerella as a causative agent for vaginitis has been studied in depth but its specific role remains controversial. Anaerobic vaginosis can be diagnosed by noting on microscopic examination the presence of clue cells, free-floating bacteria and numerous white blood cells (WBC's). Culturing an aliquot of the vaginal discharge reveals a high number of anaerobes. In addition, this condition responds to antibiotics effective against anaerobes, e.g., metronidazole. Vaginitis of undetermined aetiology is more complex and is characterized by a purulent vaginal discharge, a pH of 4.0-4.6, numerous WBC's, and a high concentration of bacteria. The microbiology of this vaginitis includes many facultative Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci. Anaerobes may be present but do not make up a large component of the endogenous microflora. This condition does not respond to the usual antibiotic therapies employed in treating bacterial vaginitis. Since this condition appears to be primarily an inflammatory reaction, it may be responsive to topical antiinflammatory agents such as benzydamine.
TI  - The role of benzydamine in the topical treatment of the so-called non-specific vaginitis.
AB  - The authors report the preliminary results of their investigation of the efficacy of benzydamine in the treatment of the so-called non-specific vaginitis. An initial in vitro study to test its bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal activity on Gardnerella vaginalis showed that the drug has high activity even at the lowest concentrations, and completely inhibits this micro-organism at 1000 micrograms/ml which is the usual concentration employed in therapy. The first pilot study performed in vivo on 14 selected vaginitis cases which were found positive for G. vaginalis by culture test appears to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of benzydamine; however, this confirmation must await the results of a double-blind clinical trial which is still in progress.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginitis within the scope of gynecologic consultation].
AB  - Examinations about bacterial vaginosis have been done in 384 fertile women according the following diagnostic criteria: Homogenous gray flour, typical fish smelling, clue cells and pH of 5 in vaginal content. Clue cells could be detected in 233 (60.6 per cent) women. Bacterial vaginosis with three of the above mentioned criteria could be found in 40.4 per cent. The cure rate following oral metronidazole therapy (twice daily 500 mg metronidazole for 5 days) was 75.2 per cent. In cases with therapy failure or frequent recurrences treatment of sexual partners is indicated, because bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease.

TI  - The in-vitro activity of roxithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, in comparison with that of erythromycin.
AB  - A study was made of the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin in comparison with that of erythromycin on selected recent clinical isolates of a wide range of organisms. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by an agar dilution method with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and the effect of pH were determined by a broth dilution method on selected strains. In general the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin mirrored that of erythromycin, but it was slightly less active. Most strains of streptococci, with the exception of enterococci, were highly sensitive to roxithromycin, as were isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. Branhamella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Staphylococci and enterococci were only moderately sensitive to both agents as was Haemophilus influenzae. Most anaerobic bacteria were sensitive although Bacteroides fragilis, fusobacteria and some strains of some clostridial species were moderately resistant. The MBCs were usually at least 16-fold higher than MICs for most staphylococci, enterococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci and B. fragilis; but for beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis the MBCs were usually only 2- to 4-fold higher than MICs. Roxithromycin was most active at pH 8 and generally for each unit fall in pH there was a 4-fold diminution of activity. However, the effect was less marked for pneumococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and H. influenzae.
TI  - New developments in the etiology and pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is unlike the "classic" sexually transmitted diseases. Unlike cervical infection with Chlamydia or salpingitis caused by N. gonorrhoeae, no single etiologic agent has been identified, and the organisms which are associated with infection have all been found as members of endogenous vaginal flora, with the possible exception of Mobiluncus species. If, as we suspect, BV is due to interactions among various organisms found in the vagina during vaginal health, we must determine what changes in the microbial or chemical ecology determine the development of BV. If, for instance, BV is simply due to an inversion in the concentrations of various organisms such that the anaerobes which are usually present in low numbers become predominant and the lactobacilli which usually predominate become few in number, we must determine which causes what. That is, does some organism or environmental change allow the anaerobes to overgrow and thereby inhibit the lactobacilli, or does some change inhibit the lactobacilli, thereby, allowing the other flora to overgrow? Answers to questions such as these await further research.
TI  - [Bacteriologic studies in premature rupture of fetal membranes and correlation with the clinical aspects of chorioamnionitis and the amnion infection syndrome].
AB  - One of the major complications following premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) is ascending infection. In this aspect the bacteria of the vaginal flora play a major part. Bacterial spectra of a group with PROM and another control group with punctual rupture of the membranes are comparatively analysed. This analysis is based on swabs taken from vagina and newborns. Data are interpreted in correlation to clinical picture of chorioamnionitis and amnion infection syndrome (AIS). Twelve newborns clinical suspected to have a neonatal infection are retrospectively judged. In the group with pregnant women with PROM potential pathological germs such as group B streptococci and E. coli are found more often, whereas physiological flora, specially Lactobacillus species, are clearly reduced. In newborns with AIS even germs can be detected, which so far have seemed to be more apathogenic, such as Gardnerella vaginalis. Bacteriological findings are discussed in connection with clinical parameters, specially group B streptococci are looked at more precisely. In newborns with AIS microbiological results are demonstrated including course of pregnancy and delivery. For the management of PROM alternatives are shown and advice for prophylaxis is given.
TI  - Transmission rate of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma spp., Gardnerella vaginalis, B-streptococci, Candida spp. and Chlamydia trachomatis from the mother to the newborn.
AB  - In a preliminary study of the transmission rate of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma species, Gardnerella vaginalis, B-Streptococci, Candida species and Chlamydia trachomatis from the mother to the newborn, swabs were taken from 45 parturients and their neonates and cultured by suitable methods. Out of 30 parturients with a positive culture, 8 harboured more than one microorganism investigated. U. urealyticum was found in 11 newborn and all of them had a positive mother. Candida spp. were found in 4 newborn, but 3 of these had a negative mother. G. vaginalis was detected in only 1 infant and the mother was negative. C. trachomatis was not isolated from any mother but was present in 2 newborn infants. Thus only U. urealyticum showed clear evidence of transmission from mother to baby.

TI  - Metronidazole-containing vaginal sponges for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - Currently, there is no FDA approved treatment for bacterial vaginosis (BV), although various oral dosages of metronidazole are used to treat this condition. A vaginal therapeutic sponge (VLI Corporation) that releases metronidazole over a 24 h use period has been developed for the treatment of BV. Each sponge contains 250 mg of metronidazole. The safety and effectiveness of using one or three metronidazole-containing vaginal sponges for the treatment of BV was evaluated in 40 patients. Use of a single sponge resulted in a cure rate of 38.9%. With three sponges the cure rate was 94.4%. Cure was defined as the absence of signs and symptoms (vaginal discharge, elevated pH, KOH prep odor, and 'clue' cells) at the one and four week follow-up visits. The sexual partners of most women were also treated with metronidazole (2 g po in one dose). None of the women were discontinued from treatment because of any adverse effects. Side-effects were minimal and required no treatment. The cure rate with the three vaginal sponge dosage appears to be similar to that associated with oral dosages of metronidazole.

TI  - Vaginal lactobacilli inhibiting growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus and other bacterial species cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - On a solid agar medium the growth-inhibitory effect of 9 Lactobacillus strains cultured from vaginal content was tested on bacteria cultured from vaginal content of women with bacterial vaginosis: Mobiluncus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides and anaerobic cocci. Inhibition zones were observed in the growth of all of the strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis around all lactobacilli. The inhibitory effect of the lactobacilli was further tested on various anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic species, both type strains and fresh extragenitally cultured strains. Four Bacteroides fragilis strains as well as 2 out of 4 Staphylococcus aureus strains were clearly inhibited by the lactobacilli. The inhibition zones were generally wider at pH 5.5 than at 6.0. For all inhibited strains, (the S. aureus excepted) a low pH on the agar around the lactobacilli correlated to wider growth-inhibition zones.
TI  - Resistance of Gardnerella vaginalis to bactericidal activity of human serum.
AB  - To assess the sensitivity of Gardnerella vaginalis to the complement mediated bactericidal activity of serum, six laboratory strains were incubated with normal human serum and two strains freshly isolated from women with non-specific vaginitis (NSV) were each incubated with homologous patient serum. There was no significant difference between the number of organisms recovered from unheated or heat inactivated serum after incubation at 37 degrees C for one hour with any of the strains tested. A suspension of G vaginalis incubated at 37 degrees C for one hour in heat inactivated homologous mouse antiserum with unheated normal human serum as a source of complement did not show any less viability than the control mixture using heat inactivated human serum. In contrast, a serum resistant strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae incubated in heat inactivated homologous mouse antiserum with unheated normal human serum showed noticeably less viability than the control. G vaginalis therefore seems to be resistant to the bactericidal activity of both normal and immune serum.
TI  - [Nonspecific vaginitis and Gardnerella vaginalis: methodological and epidemiological notes on 328 cases].
AB  - 328 samples of vaginal discharges in adult fertile women, aged between 16 and 48, were examined in this trial. After excluding 95 women (39 were affected by vaginal Trichomoniasis, 55 whose discharge presented yeasts and 1 affected by gonococcal infection), the authors divided the remaining 233 cases into subjects affected or not affected by nonspecific vaginitis (NSV) only using a Gram-stained smear. In the 83 patients affected by NSV, the authors isolated Gardnerella vaginalis in the 90.4% of the cases. After statistically correlating the different parameters described in literature as associated to NSV (pH, KOH-test, Clue Cells, isolation of G. vaginalis, symptoms), the authors concluded that: a) Gram-stained smear may be used as a simple microscopical test for diagnosis, in most of the cases, NSV; b) in most of the cases of NSV are implicated more organisms (essentially G. vaginalis and anaerobic organisms); c) G. vaginalis can be considered as a marker of these infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of A-56619 (difloxacin), A-56620, and other new quinolone antimicrobial agents against genital pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two new carboxyquinolones, A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin against genital tract pathogens. All the quinolones were highly active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A-56619 had the lowest MICs against Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC range, 0.125 to 0.25 micrograms/ml) and Haemophilus ducreyi (MIC for 90% of isolates tested, 0.1 micrograms/ml).

The S. agalactiae and G. vaginalis strains contained DNA sequences homologous to the tetM determinant, while strains of the other two genera did not.

AB  - When urine, which has been collected by suprapubic bladder aspiration, is appropriately cultured, asymptomatic bacteriuria due to fastidious organisms can be detected quite commonly in apparently healthy pregnant women; Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis can each be isolated from the bladder urine of 10 to 15% of subjects, other bacteria less frequently. Both organisms are often present together, sometimes in addition to "conventional" urinary pathogens. Overall bacteriuria occurs in about 25% of healthy pregnant women, including 6% with "conventional" asymptomatic bacteriuria. Pyuria occurs in about one-third of patients with fastidious bacteriuria. Bacteriuria due to fastidious bacteria occurs significantly more commonly in selected groups of pregnant women. U. urealyticum or G. vaginalis or both can be isolated, generally in relatively high numbers from more than 70% of pregnant women with renal disease and 20 to 30% of those with preeclampsia. In a prospective study in which urine was collected using an open ended catheter, ureaplasmas were isolated 3 times more frequently from women less than 25 years of age than from older women. Women with Ureaplasma bacteriuria at the first antenatal visit were 3 times more likely to develop preeclampsia than those without, but the mean birth weights of the infants born to the two groups of women were not significantly different. Further studies are required to determine the importance of these preliminary findings.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of eight newer quinolones and nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of nalidixic acid and the 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, A-56619, A-56620 and CI-934 was assessed by determination of MICs. The 4-quinolones were all highly active against most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, including nalidixic acid-resistant strains. Ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.002-2 mg/l) was the most active and A-56619 (MICs 0.008-32 mg/l) was the least active. A-56619, A-56620, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and CI-934 were highly active against Acinetobacter strains, pefloxacin and enoxacin were slightly less active, and a few strains were resistant to norfloxacin. All the compounds, including nalidixic acid, were active against Aeromonas strains (MICs 0.001-0.12 mg/l). Ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.06-1 mg/l) was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; A-56619 and CI-934 (MICs 1-16 mg/l) were the least active against this species. All the compounds were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae but the activity of all the compounds was poor against most isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. All the 4-quinolones were active against staphylococci and CI-934 (MICs 0.03-0.25 mg/l) was the most active. CI-934 (MICs 0.06-2 mg/l) was also the most active compound against all streptococci. Most streptococci were sensitive also to ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.25-4 mg/l) but there were many isolates resistant to the other 4-quinolones. Against the anaerobic bacteria CI-934 was again the most active compound, particularly against the Gram-positive anaerobic cocci. Pefloxacin, enoxacin and norfloxacin had poor activity against most anaerobes. Ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, A-56619 and A-56620 had good to moderate activity against all species of anaerobes except the Bacteroides fragilis group, against which none of the compounds was very active.
TI  - High-level tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae is result of acquisition of streptococcal tetM determinant.
AB  - Recently, strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated which are highly resistant to tetracycline (MICs of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml). This resistance was due to the acquisition of the resistance determinant tetM, a transposon-borne determinant initially found in the genus Streptococcus and more recently in Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Gardnerella vaginalis. In N. gonorrhoeae, the tetM determinant was located on a 25.2-megadalton plasmid. This plasmid arose from the insertion of tetM into the 24.5-megadalton gonococcal conjugative plasmid. The tetM determinant could be transferred to suitable recipient strains of N. gonorrhoeae by both genetic transformation and conjugation.

TI  - In vitro activity of difloxacin hydrochloride (A-56619), A-56620, and cefixime (CL 284,635; FK 027) against selected genital pathogens.
AB  - Management of sexually transmitted diseases is facilitated by having antimicrobial agents with activity against all of the major genital pathogens. Newer quinolones show promise of being active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. Two quinolones, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, and an oral cephalosporin, cefixime (CL 284,635; FK 027), were evaluated in vitro. All three were highly active against 400 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae, including penicillinase-producing N. gonorrhoeae, N. gonorrhoeae with chromosomally mediated resistance, and isolates with penicillin MICs of less than 1 microgram/ml. Susceptibilities to one antimicrobial agent were usually strongly correlated with susceptibilities to the other antimicrobial agents evaluated, but isolates with increasing resistance to beta-lactams were least likely to show increasing resistance to quinolones. Difloxacin and, to a lesser extent, A-56620 were active against all 10 strains of C. trachomatis, and both had moderate activity against over 200 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Based on in vitro activity, difloxacin and A-56620 merit in vivo assessment for management of both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections, and cefixime shows considerable promise for treatment of N. gonorrhoeae infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of the two new 4-quinolones A56619 and A56620 against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and two recently developed 1-aryl-fluoroquinolones, A56610 and A56620, was tested against 65 beta-lactamase-negative and 35 beta-lactamase-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 12 Chlamydia trachomatis, 50 Mycoplasma hominis, 28 Ureaplasma urealyticum and 50 Gardnerella vaginalis strains. In the case of Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis both the MIC and the MBC were determined. The MIC90 of ciprofloxacin for Neisseria gonorrhoeae was 0.008 microgram/ml and of A56619 and A56620 less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. No difference was observed between the activity against beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive strains. The MIC90 values of of ciprofloxacin and A56620 for Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum were identical, the values being 2 micrograms/ml, 1 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml respectively. The MIC90 of A56619 for Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum was 0.5 micrograms/ml and 1 microgram/ml respectively. The MBC90 values of the three quinolones for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. The activity of the quinolones against Gardnerella vaginalis was rather low, the MIC90 being greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. It is concluded that A56619 and A56620 might be useful for single-dose therapy of gonococcal infections.
TI  - Significance of Gardnerella vaginalis in urine cultures.
AB  - During a 15-month period, 12,343 consecutive routine urine cultures from female patients were screened for the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis. Of the positive urine cultures, Escherichia coli was found in 1,256 (57%) and presumptive G. vaginalis in 163 (5%). Of the 163 presumptive G. vaginalis isolates, 115 were present in quantitative categories sufficient to suggest the diagnosis of probable urinary tract infection. Of these 115 isolates, 92 were available for specific identification, of which 69 (75%) proved to be G. vaginalis. Comparison of clinical urinary tract diagnoses for the 69 G. vaginalis patients and a matched cohort of E. coli patients showed a significant correlation of E. coli recovery with the diagnosis of urinary tract infection and a significant correlation of G. vaginalis recovery with no urinary tract infection. G. vaginalis was frequently recovered from nonsymptomatic pregnant patients. G. vaginalis appeared at best to be an uncommon urinary tract pathogen.
TI  - Streptococci as urinary pathogens.
AB  - In a 2-month prospective study of streptococci isolated from urine specimens in the laboratory, 242 strains of catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccobacilli were isolated in substantial numbers from 11,725 specimens. These comprised 10% of the important isolates. Species identification of all isolates was undertaken. 74 (30%) of the isolates were of species other than Streptococcus faecalis and S agalactiae. 79 (33%) were not detected on cysteine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient agar after overnight incubation in a carbon dioxide incubator. 20 of the 24 isolates of coccobacilli were Gardnerella vaginalis. Many of the isolates of fastidious species were accompanied by pyuria. An isolation protocol practicable in busy laboratories is proposed.

TI  - Quantitative studies of vaginal bacteria.
AB  - A quantitative method of culture, based on a weighed sample and with results expressed as colony forming units (cfu)/g was assessed and used to investigate the vaginal flora of normal women and that of women with vaginal disease. Samples were collected by means of disposable plastic loops into modified proteose peptone water transport medium in preweighed bottles. Counts expressed as cfu/g of secretion were consistent, whereas counts expressed as cfu/ml were inconsistent. Results obtained with specimens manipulated on the open bench were the same as those from duplicate samples processed in an anaerobic chamber. The normal vaginal flora was predominantly aerobic--lactobacilli, coryneforms, and coagulase negative staphylococci--with counts of greater than or equal to 10(8) cfu/g for lactobacilli. These were also present in patients with candidosis, but the flora in patients with trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhoea, or chlamydial infection was predominantly anaerobic. The commonest anaerobes were Bacteroides spp, particularly B bivius; they were found in 55% of controls but at counts of 10(2) cfu/g lower than in the patients, most of whom had high counts of anaerobes (greater than 10(8) cfu/g). The isolation rate of Gardnerella vaginalis was not appreciably greater from patients with bacterial vaginosis, and the quantitative cultures on controls and patients who were G vaginalis positive were the same (approximately equal to 10(7) cfu/g). Quantitative studies show greater differences than qualitative cultures between normal controls and patients with vaginal infections, indicating that some symptoms and signs of such infections may be related to quantitative polymicrobial changes.
TI  - Vulvar disorders in the prepubertal female.
AB  - Inspection of the vulva should be a routine part of well child care. Detection of poor perineal hygiene permits the establishment of good hygiene practices, which may prevent development of vulvovaginitis. Condylomata acuminata, molluscum contagiosum, herpetic vulvitis, and vulvovaginitis secondary to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis arouse suspicion of child sexual abuse, which must be addressed. Atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus, and lichen sclerosis et atrophicus are often chronic and early diagnosis with appropriate treatment and follow-up contributes to the acceptance of the disease by parent and child. Early detection of the rare neoplasms of the vulva is essential to improved survival.

TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.

TI  - Detection of a species-specific antigen of Gardnerella vaginalis by Western blot  analysis.
AB  - Western blot analysis was used to identify antigenic components of Gardnerella vaginalis. Polypeptides bound to nitrocellulose membranes were probed with murine antisera raised to two strains of G. vaginalis, and antibody-antigen complexes were detected with 125I-labelled antimouse immunoglobulin followed by autoradiography. Although there was inter-strain variation in immunogenic polypeptide profiles, all 23 strains of G. vaginalis examined contained a common antigen of molecular mass 41 kDa. This antigen was not found in any of six other bacterial genera.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis-associated balanoposthitis.
AB  - The clinical features, microbiologic investigation, and response to therapy of three patients with Gardnerella vaginalis-associated balanoposthitis were studied. Each man presented with a similar syndrome of diffuse erythema and pruritus of the glans meatus and coronal sulcus, irritation of the prepuce, and minimal urethral discharge. A characteristic fishy odor was present in the urethral discharge of all three patients. G. vaginalis was isolated from the glans of all three, and clue cells were present in two. In all cases, cultures for Candida albicans, herpes simplex virus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were negative. All three patients responded to oral therapy with metronidazole and concurrent treatment of the partner. Two patients subsequently relapsed but ultimately responded to clindamycin therapy. These men presented with a distinctive clinical syndrome of balanoposthitis associated with G. vaginalis, which is in many respects similar to the syndrome of bacterial vaginosis in women. Our data indicate that balanoposthitis may have a polymicrobial and synergistic etiology involving G. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in the male lower genital tract; such an etiology is analogous to that of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Contribution of Gardnerella vaginalis to vaginitis in a general practice.
AB  - In a study of 154 adult women who presented to their general practitioner with vaginal symptoms 30 (20%) had Gardnerella vaginalis on its own and 51 (33%) had G vaginalis in combination with anaerobes or known pathogens. Thirty one (20%) patients were culture negative. Those who were culture negative had fewer symptoms and signs of vaginitis than those with G vaginalis alone or G vaginalis plus anaerobes. Those with known pathogens had more symptoms and signs than those with G vaginalis alone or G vaginalis plus anaerobes. Those with known pathogens plus G vaginalis had the most severe signs and symptoms of vaginitis. It is concluded that G vaginalis can cause vaginitis on its own, and it makes vaginitis worse when present with other organisms. G vaginalis was also found in 30 (21%) of the 138 control patients who, although they presented "asymptomatically," had worse signs than control patients without G vaginalis. It seems that G vaginalis can occur in a spectrum ranging from the uncomplaining patient to those with severe vaginitis.
TI  - Endometrial cultures obtained by a triple-lumen method from afebrile and febrile  postpartum women.
AB  - Transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained Ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. A protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. Compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (P less than .001). Among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group B Streptococcus, enterococcus, Gardnerella vaginalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery from the endometrium. Protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.
TI  - Polymicrobial early postpartum endometritis with facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and Chlamydia trachomatis: treatment with piperacillin or cefoxitin.
AB  - A protected, triple-lumen transcervical culture method was used to recover organisms from the endometrium. At least one facultative or one anaerobic species of bacteria was recovered from 82% of the patients, and genital mycoplasmas were recovered from 76% of the women with endometritis. Bacteria together with genital mycoplasmas were present in 61% of the women, bacteria alone were present in 20%, genital mycoplasmas alone were present in 16%, and Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 2% of the patients. The most common organisms included Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptococcus spp., Bacteroides spp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B Streptococcus, and Ureaplasma urealyticum. A randomized, double-blind regimen of either piperacillin or cefoxitin was equally successful in treating the postpartum endometritis.

Of these, one patient had a probable NGU due to G. vaginalis which is an extremely rare occurrence. The remaining eight patients were carriers of G. vaginalis. The prevalence rate of G. vaginalis in 150 randomly selected men without urethritis was five percent.
TI  - Activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. MIC90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. All strains except Escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. Pefloxacin was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; MIC90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), Esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). With Bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and B. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l) gave variable results. Amongst genitourinary isolates, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and Haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but Gardnerella vaginalis (25) and Mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). Pefloxacin was more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. No enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones, whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
TI  - A modified scheme for biotyping Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - A scheme is proposed for biotyping Gardnerella vaginalis, based on detection of hippurate hydrolysis, beta-galactosidase (ONPG) and lipase, and fermentation of arabinose, galactose and xylose. Seventeen biotypes were found among 197 strains from asymptomatic women and patients with bacterial vaginosis (non-specific vaginitis). The distribution of biotypes was similar in both populations but some biotypes were found more frequently in patients. The proposed scheme is compared with those previously described.
TI  - Microbiology of vaginal discharge in general practice.
AB  - Three groups of women were examined by culture for Gardnerella vaginalis and Candida. Group I consisted of 427 women, who complained spontaneously of vaginal discharge, group II of 311 women who did not complain of vaginal discharge until questioned prior to gynaecological examination, and group III of 100 women who denied vaginal discharge. Groups I and II also had cultures made for Trichomonas vaginalis and Neisseria gonorrhoica. In group I with spontaneous complaints the one-year prevalence rate of vaginal discharge was 3.4%. Candida, Trichomonas vaginalis and Neisseria gonorrhoica were cultured in 24%, 8% and 1% respectively. Gardnerella vaginalis was cultured in half of the women in all groups. A characteristic discharge or a positive microscopic finding was related to high concentration of Gardnerella vaginalis. A characteristic discharge even without spontaneous complaints of vaginal discharge was related to a high prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis. Women complaining from discharge had higher concentrations of Gardnerella vaginalis than non-complaining. This leads to the conclusion that clinical disease may not be present unless concentrations of Gardnerella vaginalis have risen above some minimum level. The Gardnerella vaginalis syndrome defined by positive culture, clinical finding and microscopy was found in 20% of symptomatic women.

TI  - Sexually transmissible infectious agents in sexually active and virginal asymptomatic adolescent girls.
AB  - Sixty-eight sexually active and 52 virginal adolescent girls were evaluated for six sexually transmissible infectious agents: Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. There were significant differences between sexually active and virginal girls with respect to the prevalence of isolation of U urealyticum (75% v 33%, P less than .005), M hominis (27% v 10%, P less than .05), and C trachomatis (19% v 2%, P less than .025) but not for G vaginalis (34% v 17%, P = .09). N gonorrhoeae and T vaginalis were isolated exclusively from sexually active girls, but their low prevalence (6% and 9%, respectively) made the difference statistically insignificant (P = .2 and .06, respectively). Race, current v previous sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, oral contraceptive use, and concurrent isolation of another organism did not identify those at increased risk for chlamydial isolation. Such girls were significantly more likely to have inflammatory Papanicolaou smears (36% v 10%, P less than .05) and excessive WBC in their vaginal secretions (50% v 19%, P = .05). The data support the contention that C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, and T vaginalis are organisms that are predominantly acquired via sexual routes. Significant nonsexual modes of transmission are supported by the data for the genital mycoplasmas and G vaginalis. Finally, a history of sexual activity in an adolescent female warrants specific diagnostic testing for Chlamydia.
TI  - The comparative in-vitro activity of pefloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activities of pefloxacin, other 4-quinolones and representative beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were assessed by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 0.03-2 mg/l) was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae. Gentamicin had slightly lower activity, and ceftazidime and norfloxacin similar activities to pefloxacin whereas ciprofloxacin was more active. Pefloxacin (MICs 0.03-2 mg/l) was active against Acinetobacter but again ciprofloxacin was more active. Aeromonas was highly susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.03 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.001-0.008 mg/l). Pefloxacin (MICs 1-8 mg/l) had similar activities to ceftazidime and gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but tobramycin (MICs 0.25-32 mg/l), norfloxacin (MICs 0.25-4 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.06-1 mg/l) were generally more active. Haemophilus influenzae was susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 0.008-0.06 mg/l) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, all of which were more active than ampicillin or ceftazidime. Gardnerella vaginalis was not very susceptible to pefloxacin (MICs 2-8 mg/l), the other 4-quinolones or gentamicin but ampicillin and ceftazidime were highly active. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was very susceptible to pefloxacin and norfloxacin (MICs 0.016-0.12 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.002-0.008 mg/l). The activity of pefloxacin (MICs 0.25-1 mg/l) was similar to that of ciprofloxacin (MICs 0.12-2 mg/l) but greater than that of norfloxacin (MICs 0.5-4 mg/l) against Staphylococcus aureus. Vancomycin (MICs 1-2 mg/l) had similar activity in vitro but whilst gentamicin was highly active against some isolates, others were resistant. Pefloxacin (MICs mostly 4-32 mg/l) and the other 4-quinolones had lower activity against streptococci (including alpha-, beta-, and non-haemolytic strains, enterococci and pneumococci) than against staphylococci. Benzylpenicillin (or ampicillin in the case of enterococci) were usually more active than any of the 4-quinolones. Bacteroides species, both of the fragilis and melaninogenicus/oralis groups were generally moderately resistant to pefloxacin (MICs 2-32 mg/l) and norfloxacin though ciprofloxacin was more active. Whilst the activity of pefloxacin and the other 4-quinolones was generally somewhat higher against the other anaerobes, ampicillin generally had greater activity.

TI  - Diagnosis of intrauterine infection by demonstration of antibody-coated bacteria  in the amniotic fluid.
AB  - Immunofluorescence examination of amniotic fluid for the occurrence of antibody-coated bacteria was carried out in 72 consecutive women with premature rupture of the fetal membranes to assess this method in the diagnosis of intrauterine infection. Antibody-coated bacteria were demonstrated in 11 women with clinical signs of intrauterine infection, histological amnionitis and heavy growth of one bacterial species. The presence of intrauterine infection was considered possible in another 14 women. One patient had no clinical signs of infection, but positive histological and bacteriological evidence; antibody-coated bacteria were demonstrated in this patient, but not in the remaining 13 women. In 47 women clinical, histological and bacteriological signs of intrauterine infection were absent, and examinations for antibody-coated bacteria were negative in all of them. It is concluded that the demonstration of antibody-coated bacteria in amniotic fluid indicates the presence of intrauterine infection, and the examination may in some cases be positive before the appearance of clinical signs of infection.

TI  - Etiology of cervical inflammation.
AB  - We studied the relationships of selected microbial, clinical, demographic, and behavioral variables to mucopurulent cervicitis in two clinical settings, a sexually transmitted disease clinic and a student health clinic. From each clinic, we studied a group of women referred for suspected mucopurulent cervicitis and a representative sample of other women attending the clinic. After the women were stratified by patient group and summary odds ratios for all groups were obtained, mucopurulent cervicitis was most strongly associated with the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis; other variables associated with mucopurulent cervicitis included the isolation of Ureaplasma urealyticum, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Trichomonas vaginalis, the presence of serum antibody to C. trachomatis, the clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and oral contraceptive use (positive associations) or isolation of yeast (negative association). After adjustment for cervical culture results for C. trachomatis, mucopurulent cervicitis was positively associated with oral contraceptive use (p = 0.02) and isolation of U. urealyticum (p = 0.02) and negatively associated with isolation of yeast (p = 0.03). Among women with a positive cervical culture for C. trachomatis, isolation of U. urealyticum was significantly associated with mucopurulent cervicitis, while among the subgroup of women with a negative cervical culture for C. trachomatis and positive serum antibody to C. trachomatis, oral contraceptive use was strongly associated with mucopurulent cervicitis. These results confirm that in both clinical settings C. trachomatis is the major cause of mucopurulent cervicitis. The roles of U. urealyticum, T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, and oral contraceptive use in the etiology of mucopurulent cervicitis deserve further study.
TI  - Vaginitis: current microbiologic and clinical concepts.
AB  - Infectious vaginitis occurs when the normal vaginal flora is disrupted; it may arise when saprophytes overwhelm the host immune response, when pathogenic organisms are introduced into the vagina or when changes in substrate allow an imbalance of microorganisms to develop. Examples of these types of vaginitis include the presence of chronic fungal infection in women with an inadequate cellular immune response to the yeast, the introduction of trichomonads into vaginal epithelium that has a sufficient supply of glycogen, and the alteration in bacterial flora, normally dominated by Lactobacillus spp., and its metabolites that is characteristic of "nonspecific vaginitis". The authors review microbiologic and clinical aspects of the fungal, protozoal and bacterial infections, including the interactions of bacteria thought to produce nonspecific vaginitis, that are now recognized as causing vaginitis. Other causes of vaginitis are also discussed.

AB  - Maternal genital infection, particularly subclinical amniotic fluid infection, may cause preterm labor and a premature delivery. The prevalence of subclinical amniotic fluid infection was studied in 54 consecutive afebrile women in preterm labor with singleton gestations and intact fetal membranes. Microorganisms were recovered from the amniotic fluid by transabdominal amniocentesis in 13 (24%) of 54 patients. Bacteria or Candida albicans were recovered from six (11%), and genital mycoplasmas from seven (13%). Compared with women with sterile amniotic fluid, patients whose amniotic fluid contained bacteria or Candida organisms had a shorter interval from onset of preterm labor until delivery (0.6 versus 34.3 days, P less than .01), were less responsive to tocolytic therapy (0 versus 81% success rate, P less than .005), and more frequently developed subsequent intrapartum fever (83 versus 2.4%, P less than .005). In contrast, women whose amniotic fluid contained genital mycoplasmas did not differ in these parameters from those with sterile fluid. Also compared was cervical-vaginal infection among these patients in preterm labor with matched control subjects without preterm labor. In this analysis, bacterial vaginosis was identified in 43% of patients with and 14% of women without preterm labor (P = .02), yielding a relative risk of preterm labor for patients with bacterial vaginosis of 3.8. These data underscore the importance of amniotic fluid bacterial infections in preterm labor and premature delivery, and suggest that bacterial vaginosis is associated with prematurity.
TI  - A retrospective study of doxycycline in the treatment of genitourinary infections.
AB  - A retrospective study was conducted to assess the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma ureolyticum, and Mycoplasma sp in patients with suspected genital infection, and to assess the efficacy of doxycycline and other current antibiotic therapies. Over a three-year period, 1,048 records of patients (64% female; 36% male) were reviewed. C trachomatis, U ureolyticum, or Mycoplasma hominis was found in 39% of the men and 49% of the women. Other pathogens included Gardnerella vaginalis (in 21%), Candida albicans (in 12%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (in 4%), and Trichomonas vaginalis (in 1%). Doxycycline eradicated C trachomatis in 88% of patients, U ureolyticum in 87%, and M hominis in 95%. Eradication rates with erythromycin were 91%, 71%, and 100% and with tetracycline, 88%, 92%, and 80%, respectively.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis treated with metronidazole. Effects on the vaginal microbiology by a single dose versus a five days regimen.
AB  - The microbiological vaginal flora was studied in 42 women with clinical findings  consistent with the concept bacterial vaginosis (BV). The women and their consorts were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl), either a single dose of 2,000 mg or 400 mg three times daily for five days. Effect of treatment was assessed four weeks after its initiation. Clinical cure was attained in more than 80% of the cases and was the same irrespective of treatment. The microbiologic flora changed by treatment in direction to normal, i.e. lactobacilli regained predominance and reduction of Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic grampositive cocci was evident. There was no difference evident in the microbiological changes induced by the two treatment regimens. The findings support previous conclusions that BV represents a disorder of the vaginal milieu and is not the result of an infection with pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of oral and vaginal metronidazole therapy for nonspecific bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - A prospective, randomized, nonblind study was performed to compare the efficacy of a 7-day vaginal regimen with 500 mg metronidazole (Flagyl) once a day and that of oral treatment with 400 mg metronidazole twice daily for 7 days in the treatment of nonspecific bacterial vaginosis. No treatment was given to the sexual partners and there was no restriction of sexual intercourse. 38 women completed the study and at follow-up after 4 weeks, women receiving vaginal therapy had a cure rate of 79% compared with 74% in the women on oral therapy. Cure rates were lower among users of an intrauterine contraceptive device (57 versus 88% among nonusers). The occurrence of lactate-producing bacteria (lactobacilli and aerobic streptococci) in the vagina was significantly higher in women after vaginal compared with oral therapy. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 58% of the women after vaginal and in 44% of the women after oral treatment. It is concluded that vaginal application of 500 mg metronidazole daily for 7 days is equally effective as oral administration in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - The identification of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - In an attempt to develop a rapid identification system for Gardnerella vaginalis  that could be used in a clinical microbiologic laboratory, we examined 102 samples of vaginal discharge from women with symptoms of vaginitis. Gardnerella vaginalis was obtained from 77 of 102 cases. We found a combination of six tests of particular value for distinguishing G. vaginalis from other catalase-negative coryneforms isolated from vagina.
TI  - [Amine colpitis].
AB  - Significance of KOH test and isonitril (isocyanide) reaction tested in 104 patients was compared with our microbial culture results. In Gardnerella vaginalis as well as in no spores forming anaerobic germs the KOH test was not and the isonitril reaction was only insignificant reliable. Both tests are not able to substitute the procedures of culturing germs including those of Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum.
TI  - Two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography for the specific detection of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms.
AB  - Glycine, one of the end products of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms, was detected by a rapid, specific technique utilizing two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. A loopful of growth of each organism from its suitable agar medium was washed, suspended, and incubated with 0.1% sodium hippurate for 30 min at 37 degrees C. The supernatant of the incubated suspension from each organism was then dansylated, and the dansyl derivatives were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyamide sheets. Glycine, a product of hippurate hydrolysis, was detected under UV light. This technique does not require prolonged incubation and was found to be more specific and reliable than the standard ninhydrin reaction. In addition, it is inexpensive and can be easily conducted in a clinical microbiological reference laboratory. By this method, 100% (22/22) of Campylobacter jejuni and 0% (0/9) of Campylobacter coli reference strains were positive. In addition, 100% (13/13) of group B streptococci, 100% (24/24) of group D streptococci, and 90% (18/20) of Gardenerella vaginalis clinical isolates were positive for hippurate hydrolysis. This method is useful for the identification to the species level of Campylobacter organisms and the biotyping of Gardnerella organisms and for the detection of hippurate hydrolysis by unknown microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro comparative study of RU 28965 against organisms from oral and vaginal flora.
AB  - The Authors studied the activity of RU 28965, a new macrolide antibiotic, in comparison whith erytromycin, josamycin, miocamycin, ampicillin and rifampicin against oral streptococci (45 strains), coryneform bacteria (23 strains) and G. vaginalis (15 strains). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and the effect of inoculum size on MICs were determined. RU 28965 showed better activity than the other macrolides. The MICs of RU 28965 were eightfold higher than the corresponding MICs. The MICs of RU 28965 showed up to 10 fold increase by increasing the inoculum density from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and mosaic colposcopic pattern of the cervix: casual or causal association?
AB  - We made a retrospective study of the flora found in the vaginal smears of sexually active women who presented with a mosaic colposcopic pattern of the uterine cervix in an attempt to study some of its epidemiologic factors. Of the 195 cervicovaginal cytologies of patients with mosaic, 61 revealed an abnormal flora (31.2%) while of the 9,856 patients without mosaic, only 2,234 cytologies had an abnormal flora (22.7%) demonstrating a statistically significant higher frequency (p less than 0.0001) of an abnormal flora in women with a mosaic pattern on the cervix. A statistically significant association (p less than 0.02) was encountered between the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis and the mosaic colposcopic pattern, and surprisingly a statistically greater frequency (p less than 0.05) of biopsied dysplasias in the same group. At the moment we can interpret these observations as nothing more than interesting initial findings.
TI  - Tioconazole 2% cream in the treatment of Trichomonas vaginalis or mixed vaginal infections.
AB  - Twenty patients with documented T. vaginalis infections, six of whom were simultaneously infected with C. albicans and one with G. vaginalis, were treated topically (intravaginally) once daily with 5 g of 2% tioconazole vaginal cream (Trosyd, Pfizer) for 3 consecutive days in an open, non-comparative study. At the first follow-up visit (about 7 days post-treatment), 95% (19/20) of the patients were cured; 95% (18/19) of patients remained cured with respect to the baseline infection at the long-term follow-up (2 months post-treatment) visit, and one patient had a reinfection or relapse with T. vaginalis. Only one patient reported a side-effect, a mild vaginal burning which disappeared with continued treatment. It was concluded that tioconazole 2% vaginal cream is safe and effective for the treatment of T. vaginalis and mixed vaginal infections.

TI  - Treatment of bacterial vaginosis with an acid cream: a comparison between the effect of lactate-gel and metronidazole.
AB  - Bacteriological isolation of anaerobes, Gardnerella and lactobacilli was carried  out in a group of 62 women with the diagnosis bacterial vaginosis and 42 control women. Lactobacilli were the predominant organisms in the control group whereas anaerobes dominated the flora in bacterial vaginosis patients. Lactate-gel (pH 3.5, 5 ml) inserted into the vagina daily for 7 days is as effective as oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. The women in both groups became symptom-free and objectively improved. Anaerobes were significantly reduced (p less than 0.0001) in both groups after 1-week treatment but Gardnerella was not significantly reduced. As bacterial vaginosis is generally looked upon as a mild noninflammatory condition lactate-gel seems to be an ideal treatment for this disease.
TI  - Prevalence of nonspecific vaginitis and other cervicovaginal infections during the third trimester of pregnancy.
AB  - Nonspecific vaginitis (NSV) is a clinical syndrome characterized by a decreased concentration of normal acidophilic Doderlein flora in the vagina and increased concentration of nonacidophilic microorganisms, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasmas. Since several NSV-associated organisms are associated with complications of pregnancy, we studied the prevalence of NSV among 104 consecutive women during the third trimester of pregnancy. Overall, 14 women (14%) had NSV by clinical and/or biochemical criteria, two women had Chlamydia trachomatis isolated from the cervix, and 24 women (23%) had yeast isolated from the vagina. None had Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Trichomonas vaginalis isolated. There was a correlation between an abnormal succinate to lactate ratio (on gas-liquid chromatography) and cytologic atypia detected by cervicovaginal Papanicolaou smears. More extensive studies are needed to correlate NSV with prematurity.
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin versus metronidazole/gentamicin in the treatment of severe pelvic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of sulbactam/ampicillin versus metronidazole/gentamicin were compared in 39 patients with severe pelvic infections. 30 patients had severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, 3 tubo-ovarian abscesses, 4 endomyometritis, and 2 posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 259 micro-organisms from 38 patients; an average of 6.8 bacteria per infection (3.9 anaerobes and 2.9 aerobes). The most frequent isolates were Bacteroides spp. (21), B. bivius (13), B. disiens (8), Fusobacterium spp. (9), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (15), P. asaccharolyticus (8), anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (17), Gardnerella vaginalis (24), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (14), alpha-haemolytic streptococci (6) and Escherichia coli (3). Clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 of 19 treated with metronidazole/gentamicin. The sulbactam/ampicillin failure was a patient with pelvic inflammatory disease with a positive Chlamydia trachomatis culture who required antichlamydial therapy. The metronidazole/gentamicin failures included a patient with a tubo-ovarian abscess requiring surgical drainage and 2 patients with pelvic inflammatory disease requiring antichlamydial treatment. No adverse haematological, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.
TI  - In vitro adherence of Lactobacillus species to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  - Because of the reported use of yogurt douches for the treatment of vaginitis, the adherence of Lactobacillus species to normal human vaginal epithelial cells was tested by in vitro methods. L. acidophilus and L. bulgaricus isolated from three commercial yogurts were compared to L. acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. cellobiosus, and L. casei isolated from clinical specimens and from American Type Culture Collection cultures. L. acidophilus isolated from Lactinex tablets was also tested. No significant difference was found among the 19 clinical isolates, the American Type Culture Collection cultures, and the Lactinex isolate, but all showed significantly higher (p less than 0.01) adherence than any Lactobacillus isolated from yogurt. The presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, which adheres strongly to vaginal epithelial cells, was found to interfere with the adherence of lactobacilli from all sources studied.
TI  - Adhesion of Gardnerella vaginalis to vaginal epithelial cells: variables affecting adhesion and inhibition by metronidazole.
AB  - Variables affecting the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis to human vaginal epithelial cells were examined in vitro. Adherence depended on pH, with maximum attachment occurring between pH 5 and pH 6. Preincubation of the bacteria at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes and ultraviolet irradiation resulted in a noticeable decrease in adherence. In contrast, adherence was not altered by preincubating the epithelial cells under these conditions. Periodate oxidation of the vaginal cells caused an appreciable reduction in subsequent adherence of G vaginalis. None of the 19 single carbohydrates tested inhibited adherence completely. Metronidazole at subinhibitory concentrations for G vaginalis, appreciably reduced the adhesive capacity of G vaginalis, whereas subinhibitory concentrations of ampicillin did not.
TI  - A case of conjunctivitis in a neonate due to Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - A case of conjunctivitis in a neonate caused by Gardnerella vaginalis is described. The diagnosis was confirmed by examination of a Gram-stained smear, isolation of the organism from the conjunctival swab, and also by response to treatment with chloramphenicol. The organism was probably derived from the mother's birth canal during delivery and the early rupture of membrane might be the predisposing factor.
TI  - Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis from high vaginal swabs.
AB  - Vaginal swabs from 2715 consecutive unselected women with vaginal discharge were  examined for Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans and Trichomonas vaginalis. Of 2715 women, 2043 had non-specific vaginitis and G. vaginalis was isolated from 269 cases (13.2%). Thirty five of the strains were isolated together with C. albicans, eight with T. vaginalis, six with Bacteroides species and three each with group B Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. Two hundred and sixteen (80%) of the isolates were from females between the age of 20 and 34. All 269 strains hydrolysed hippurate and fermented starch; 161 (60%) were isolated from swabs without clue cells. Although facts suggest that vaginal discharge in most of these cases had been associated with G. vaginalis, a possible aetiological role for other micro-organisms has not been ruled out. However, successful therapy with metronidazole in 80% of those cases suggests that G. vaginalis is one cause of non-specific vaginitis. The prevalence rate of G. vaginalis in 160 randomly selected women without vaginal discharge was 5%.
TI  - Comparison of two different metronidazole regimens in the treatment of Gardnerella vaginalis infection with or without trichomoniasis.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis infection confirmed by culture was treated either by a 2 g  dose or divided doses of metronidazole in 100 and 200 female patients respectively. Both dosages were equally effective. We recommend a single dose of 2 g metronidazole in the treatment of Gard. vaginalis infection, particularly when association with trichomoniasis is confirmed or suspected.
TI  - Microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - The prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococcus, lactobacillus, Mycoplasma species, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. Sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (SD = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (SD = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (P = 0.001). Sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal G. vaginalis, lactobacilli, Mycoplasma species, and U. urealyticum, as well as endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoea, and T. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. Significant differences in isolation rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum, and endocervical Mycoplasma species, U. urealyticum, C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis. In general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; N. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. Differences were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific vaginitis. Vaginal G. vaginalis and Mycoplasma species and endocervical Mycoplasma species and U. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. It is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.

TI  - [Detection of Gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogen spectrum of sexually transmissible diseases in vulvovaginitis].
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis, a sexually transmittable organism, is regarded as the indicator of the so-called "non-specific vaginitis". The isolation rate of G. vaginalis from 72 women attending our out-patient department during one year because of urogenital complaints was higher in pretreated than in untreated patients. In genital swabs taken from untreated patients, G. vaginalis could be isolated only in 17%, whereas this was observed in 38% of the specimens from women pretreated with various antimicrobial agents. In 9% of the women without vaginal discharge G. vaginalis was isolated. In specimens obtained from 53% of the women positive for G. vaginalis further organisms such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma spp. and B-Streptococci could be isolated. Asymptomatic infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (1) and C. trachomatis (4) were also observed. The present study clearly demonstrates that a broad microbiological examination is essential for specific therapy in vaginitis. Even if unspecific vaginitis is diagnosed by the presence of clue-cells, increased vaginal pH and fishy odour, a combined infection by further sexually transmittable organisms, especially N. gonorrhoeae, is to be excluded.
TI  - [Prevalence of 7 microorganisms in abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis)].
AB  - Seven microorganisms (N. gonorrhoeae, C. albicans, T. vaginalis, G. vaginalis, M. hominis, U. urealyticum and Streptococcus of group B) have been assayed in genital samplings of 164 asymptomatic women (control group) and of 374 women suffering from abnormal vaginal secretions (vaginitis group). All these bacteria except group B Streptococci were isolated in the vaginitis group more frequently than in the control group (p less than 0.01). The proportion of negative cultures for all tested bacteria was 39% in the control group and 6.4% in the vaginitis group (p less than 0.01). This shows an association of these bacteria with 70% of the patients of the vaginitis group and with only 26% of the women of the control group (p less than 0.01). It is to be noted that the pH values are higher in the group of women with vaginitis than in the control group (p less than 0.01). Comparison of the microbial flora during "specific" an "non-specific" vaginitis indicates that G. vaginalis is isolated more frequently in patients with non-specific vaginitis than among those with specific vaginitis (p less than 0.01). Likewise, M. hominis is isolated more frequently in groups of women with either non-specific vaginitis or T. vaginalis vaginitis, than in groups of patients with a C. albicans vaginitis (p less than 0,01). The results of this study indicate that there is a causal relationship between vaginitis and the presence of T. vaginalis. C. albicans, G. vaginalis, M. hominis or N. gonorrhoeae, either as a single or a mixed infection, and that there is a relationship between increased pH values and abnormal vaginal secretions.
TI  - Predictive value of the "clue cells" investigation and the amine volatilization test in vaginal infections caused by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Although still controversial, an etiologic role of Gardnerella vaginalis is imputed in vaginitis. Besides isolation of the organism by culture, two alternative diagnostic procedures have been claimed to be useful: the investigation of "clue cells" in clinical specimens and the amine volatilization test or fishy odor perception in genital secretions. Herein we report on the findings of the simultaneous use of G. vaginalis isolation, the clue cell test and amine volatilization perception in specimens from 1,263 consecutive female patients referred to our clinic. Our results show that the simultaneous use of both alternative tests is very useful as a screening procedure. A negative result of both tests predicts a negative culture result in 99% of the cases. However, a positive result of either or both should be considered as an indication to proceed to culture and not as diagnostic of infection.

TI  - Treatment of the Gardnerella vaginalis syndrome. A controlled, double-blind study comparing pivampicillin and metronidazole.
AB  - A double-blind, randomized, therapeutic study was carried out in 289 patients with vaginal discharge and growth of Gardnerella vaginalis (GV) and no growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis or Candida. Treatment consisted of either pivampicillin (Pondocillin), 700 mg twice daily for seven days, or metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for seven days. The effect was evaluated on the basis of the patient's statement and on the result of culture for GV immediately after end of treatment. Evaluated from the culture results metronidazole was significantly more effective than pivampicillin in eradicating GV. The efficacy of the two medications was 69% and 54%, respectively. The evaluations by the patients in the two groups, on the other hand, did not differ significantly, although there was a tendency to consider metronidazole as the most effective. Metronidazole must be considered the most potent drug today, and we recommend it as the medication of choice, provided that the diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical picture and microscopy and not only by culture.
TI  - Diagnostic value of clinical examination, direct microscopy, and culture in the Gardnerella vaginalis syndrome.
AB  - In a general practice 467 women aged 15-49 years with vaginal discharge were consecutively examined in order to compare the diagnostic value in the Gardnerella vaginalis syndrome of the clinical examination, direct microscopy of the vaginal secretion, and culture. We found significant correlations between all relevant combinations of the diagnostic methods. The predictive value of a positive test for the clinical examination, the microscopy, and the clinical examination combined with microscopy, respectively, was 0.75, 0.89 and 0.90, whereas the predictive values of the negative test were 0.59, 0.72 and 0.61, respectively. Because even small numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis may yield growth on selective culture media, the clinical examination and the microscopy are often negative despite positive culture. To avoid overtreatment of a benign condition we therefore conclude that the presence of a characteristic clinical picture and positive microscopy constitute a safe basis for the diagnosis of the Gardnerella vaginalis syndrome, and that the diagnosis should be based on this combination or on the fulfilment of three of the following four criteria: 1) characteristic vaginal secretion; 2) vaginal pH greater than 4.5; 3) positive potassium hydroxide test or characteristic herring-brine smell, and 4) clue cells at microscopy. With the present methods culture for Gardnerella vaginalis should not routinely be performed, until the value of quantitated methods has been proved. Coexistence of other microorganisms rendered the diagnosis difficult. We recommend to treat the most predominant infection first.
TI  - An office laboratory panel to assess vaginal problems.
AB  - In determining the cause of vaginal complaints, the routine use of four simple tests ("the vagina panel") enables the physician to identify pathogens (Candida, Gardnerella, Trichomonas), pathologic processes (inflammation, estrogen deficiency) and, in most instances, a healthy vagina. Time and money are saved. The specimens can be collected in one minute during a pelvic examination. The panel can provide the answers to eight essential questions in two minutes of observer time, with supplies costing about $2.

A control group consisted of 225 women without vaginal discharge. The study showed that patients with GV significantly more frequently used tampons for menstrual hygiene, sought medical assistance for vaginal discharge more often, and had more sexual partners. On the other hand, no difference was found between the two groups as to type of contraception, number of previous deliveries, and unsuccessful attempts of getting pregnant.

TI  - Comparison of single-dose vs one-week course of metronidazole for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In a prospective, single-blind, randomized study, a single 2-g dose of metronidazole was compared with a seven-day course of 500 mg given twice daily in the treatment of symptomatic vaginal discharge associated with Gardnerella vaginalis. Based on resolution of symptoms and on cultures negative for G vaginalis, 86% (40/46) of women treated with the single dose and 97% (35/36) of women treated with the seven-day course were considered cured at seven to ten days after treatment. Evaluation at 21 days after treatment, however, indicated that only 46% (16/34) of patients treated with the single 2-g dose were considered cured compared with 86% (26/30) of those treated with the seven-day course. Treatment of sexual contacts did not significantly improve cure rates in either group.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole against Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus spp. in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - An open, randomized, culture-controlled clinical study was designed to compare the efficacy of a single 2 g dose of metronidazole (Elyzol) with standard 7-day therapy in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Forty-one of 47 (87%) patients given the single dose and 30 of 33 (91%) given the 7-day treatment were found to be cured seven days after treatment. At final assessment, 24 of 34 (71%) patients given the single dose and 22 of 28 (79%) given the 7-day treatment remained cured. The two regimes were equally efficaceous in eradicating Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides spp. and Mobiluncus spp. (anaerobic curved rods) from vaginal specimens from patients with BV. The in-vitro activity of metronidazole and its hydroxy metabolite was determined for 11 strains of Gard. vaginalis, 17 strains of Bacteroides spp. and 14 strains of Mobiluncus spp. which had been isolated from patients prior to treatment. The MIC of metronidazole against Gard. vaginalis varied between 2 and greater than or equal to 128 mg/l (median MIC 32 mg/l), but the hydroxy metabolite showed a markedly increased activity against eight of the strains tested (median MIC 4 mg/l). The MIC of metronidazole against the Mobiluncus spp. varied between 0.5 and greater than or equal to 128 mg/l (median MIC 16 mg/l) and the hydroxy metabolite showed little increased activity (median MIC also 16 mg/l). The Bacteroides organisms were highly susceptible to metronidazole and to the hydroxy metabolite, each having a median MIC of 1 mg/l.
TI  - Moxalactam versus clindamycin plus tobramycin in the treatment of obstetric and gynecologic infections.
AB  - The clinical efficacy of moxalactam versus clindamycin/tobramycin was evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. Sixty patients were treated: 30 with moxalactam and 30 with clindamycin/tobramycin. There were 15 cases of tuboovarian abscess, 36 cases of severe pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, eight cases of endomyometritis, and one wound abscess. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the sites of infection yielded 441 microorganisms from 53 patients; an average of 8.3 bacteria per infection (4.5 anaerobes and 3.8 aerobes). The infections tended to be mixed aerobic-anaerobic with anaerobes isolated in 90% of cases. The most frequently isolated possible pathogens were Bacteroides sp. (37), Bacteroides bivius (23), Bacteroides asaccharolyticus (12), Peptococcus asaccharolyticus (29), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (19), unidentified anaerobic gram-positive cocci (18), Escherichia coli (17), nonhemolytic streptococci (16), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (13), and Gardnerella vaginalis (38). Clinical cure was noted in 29 of 30 moxalactam-treated and 29 of 30 clindamycin/tobramycin-treated patients. Moxalactam was effective in five of six cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 22 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, the one case of endomyometritis and the one wound abscess. Clindamycin/tobramycin was effective in eight of nine cases of tuboovarian abscess, all 14 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with peritonitis, and all seven cases of endomyometritis. No adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted with either regimen.
TI  - Importance of differential diagnosis in acute vaginitis.
AB  - Acute vaginitis is one of the most common diseases seen in the practice of office gynecology. Large survey studies of women with lower genital tract symptoms suggestive of vaginitis have demonstrated the presence of three major etiologic categories in acute vaginitis: (1) nonspecific vaginosis (Gardnerella vaginalis), (2) vulvovaginal candidiasis (Candida albicans), and (3) trichomoniasis (Trichomonas vaginalis). Effective treatment of acute vaginitis requires that an accurate diagnosis be established and etiologic microorganism(s) be identified. In general, the differential diagnosis of acute vaginitis does not rely on elaborate technology but, rather, requires inexpensive and readily available office equipment and supplies, a detailed history, and an adequate examination of the external genitalia, vagina, and cervix. Only after the etiology of vaginitis has been identified can appropriate therapeutic intervention(s) be utilized.

AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis was ingested and killed by neutrophils in the presence of normal human serum. Heat inactivation of the serum inhibited these processes. The opsonisation of some but not all G vaginalis strains was enhanced by immune rabbit serum. Immune serum did not, however, enhance intracellular killing. Blockade of the classical pathway of complement activation had no effect on the opsonic activity of human serum. These results suggest that the opsonisation, phagocytosis, and killing of G vaginalis by human serum and neutrophils is primarily mediated by complement activated by the alternative pathway. Serum without neutrophils has little effect on the viability of G vaginalis.
TI  - Nonspecific vaginitis following sexual abuse in children.
AB  - Nonspecific vaginitis, one of the most common causes of vaginitis in adults, is a polymicrobial infection in which vaginal anaerobes act synergistically with Gardnerella vaginalis. The diagnosis is made by examination of the vaginal secretions for clue cells, the development of a fishy odor after the addition of 10% KOH to vaginal secretions, and a vaginal pH greater than 4.5. To determine whether nonspecific vaginitis occurs in sexually abused children, we obtained vaginal washes from 31 abused and 23 nonabused children, 21/2 to 13 years of age. A child was considered to have definite nonspecific vaginitis if her wash contained both clue cells and odor; she was considered to have possible nonspecific vaginitis if her wash contained either clue cells or odor. We did not use vaginal pH as a diagnostic criterion because the normal range has not been standardized in prepubertal girls. Possible nonspecific vaginitis (odor only) was found in only 1/23 (4%) of nonabused children. This girl was asymptomatic and findings from her examination were normal. Only one of the 31 abused children had possible nonspecific vaginitis (odor) detected at the initial examination, less than 48 hours after the episode of abuse, whereas 4/31 (13%) developed definite, and 4/31 (13%) possible nonspecific vaginitis at the follow-up visit more than seven days after the episode of abuse or rape. Five of these eight girls developed either a new vaginal discharge or dysuria; three were treated with metronidazole with resolution of their symptoms and reversion of the vaginal wash to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Isolation and identification of Gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  - Thirty-four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were studied. They were isolated from non specific vaginitis. A presumptive identification can be based on colonial morphology, Gram stain characteristics, negative catalase and oxidase test. The differentiation of Gardnerella vaginalis from other negative catalase coccobacilli is based on the acid formation of carbohydrates, enzymatic test, analysis of short chain volatile and non volatile end products of fermentation in GLC. All Gardnerella strains produce acid from glucose, maltose, starch and are hippurate and alpha glucosidase positive. They are sulfonamide resistant, acetic, lactic and succinic acids are detected by gas liquid chromatography.

TI  - Identification of Gardnerella vaginalis with the API 20 Strep system.
AB  - A total of 137 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were examined by the API 20 Strep system. The system was shown to be reliable when the tests were compared with standard identification methods, and very little confusion occurred with streptococcal profiles; consequently, G. vaginalis has been included in the API 20 Strep data base.
TI  - Vaginitis.
AB  - Vaginitis is one of the most common complaints of women in the United States today. About 90% of patients with this problem suffer from infection of the vagina caused by Candida, Gardnerella, or Trichomonas. The diagnosis and effective treatment of these common infections depend on accurate identification of the entity, effective specific therapy, and restoration of the normal ecosystem of the vagina. At the same time women should be made aware that not all discharge means infection and that any attempts at self-treatment may only worsen their condition. Proper hygiene habits, dietary control, and management of stress are all helpful factors in the control of recurrent vaginal infections.
TI  - Non-specific vaginitis: diagnostic features and response to imidazole therapy (metronidazole, ornidazole).
AB  - Detailed quantitative aerobic, anaerobic, fungal and mycoplasma flora was obtained for 43 women presenting with complaints of vaginal discharge and malodour. Clinical response was associated with eradication of the abnormal anaerobic flora, despite persistence of G vaginalis in nine (26%). Topical imidazole therapy appeared to have some advantage over oral therapy. Gram stains of vaginal swabs were found to be the most useful laboratory investigation.
TI  - Clinical comparison of an agar slide blood culture bottle with tryptic soy broth  and a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth.
AB  - The Roche Septi-Chek biphasic blood culture system with tryptic soy broth was compared with a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth in 6,956 paired blood cultures from adult patients. Both systems were inoculated with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. More clinically important bacteria and fungi, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans and C. tropicalis were recovered from the biphasic system (P less than 0.001). In contrast, more clinically important anaerobic bacteria (P less than 0.001) and Gardnerella vaginalis (P less than 0.05) were recovered in conventional supplemented peptone broth. Staphylococci (P less than 0.01), Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli (P less than 0.05), and fungi (P less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas streptococci (P less than 0.001) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. The overall superiority of the agar slide blood culture system compared with conventional blood culture bottles was confirmed by this evaluation. For optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the agar slide bottle should be paired with an anaerobic bottle.
TI  - Evaluation of gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infection: a preliminary report.
AB  - Gas-liquid chromatography has been proposed as a possible tool in the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infections. The analysis is based on the identification of specific organic acids derived from bacterial metabolism when organisms are present within the amniotic fluid. We retrospectively subjected 69 samples of amniotic fluid which had been obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis to analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. Forty-seven samples were derived from patients who either were in premature labor or had premature rupture of membranes with associated premature labor. Twenty-two specimens which served as a comparison group were obtained from patients who underwent amniocentesis for assessment of fetal maturity. The results obtained from chromatographic analysis are presented, and the possible applications of this technique to the clinical situation are discussed.
TI  - Colistin-oxolinic acid blood agar: a selective medium for the isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Colistin-oxolinic acid medium is proposed as a selective isolation medium for Gardnerella vaginalis. The medium is effective in inhibiting staphylococci and gram-negative bacteria while allowing growth of G. vaginalis.

TI  - The in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin were compared with that of the  other new 4-quinolone, ciprofloxacin. All three compounds were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general less susceptible, though for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas species (including aeruginosa) MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 0.5-2 mg/l) than was enoxacin (MICs 8-32 mg/l). Staphylococci were susceptible to ofloxacin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/l) and enoxacin (MICs 0.5-2 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin. Streptococci also were mostly sensitive to the compounds though the MICs of enoxacin (4-64 mg/l) were noticeably higher than those of ofloxacin (1-4 mg/l). Anaerobes were in general susceptible though, as with streptococci, ofloxacin, with activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin, was more active than enoxacin. Variants of Enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility were readily selected in the laboratory with either enoxacin or ofloxacin as the selective agent. The MICs of all the 4-quinolones were usually increased four- to 16-fold for these strains; they could therefore be regarded as remaining susceptible to the newer compounds.
TI  - Effect of sodium polyanetholesulfonate and gelatin on the recovery of Gardnerella vaginalis from blood culture media.
AB  - Sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) is used as a routine supplement to blood culture media to enhance recovery of microorganisms, but it inhibits the growth of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Streptobacillus moniliformis. Comparative clinical blood culture studies at the University of Colorado Hospital suggested that SPS also inhibits the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis. We inoculated 16 blood culture isolates of G. vaginalis into 11 blood culture media containing SPS or sodium amylosulfate, with and without gelatin. In the absence of gelatin, only brain heart infusion and thiol broths with SPS supported the growth of more than five strains of G. vaginalis, whereas all media except Bactec 6B and 7C and brucella broths recovered most isolates with SPS and gelatin or with sodium amylosulfate alone. We conclude that SPS inhibits the growth of G. vaginalis in blood culture media but that this inhibition is medium dependent and can be overcome by supplementation of most media with gelatin.

TI  - Carriage of Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes in semen.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from 22 (38%) of 58 semen samples obtained from men attending an infertility clinic. Counts ranged from 1.2 X 10(3) to greater than 10(7) colony forming units (cfu)/ml. There was no association between the isolation of G vaginalis and the sperm count. Twenty (34.4%) samples contained non-sporing anaerobes and nine (15.5%) both anaerobes and G vaginalis. The infective dose of G vaginalis is not known, but semen could act as a medium for its sexual transmission.
TI  - Anaerobes and Gardnerella vaginalis in non-specific vaginitis.
AB  - Clinical evidence of bacterial vaginosis was present in 25 (35%) of 72 patients attending a London venereology clinic and correlated significantly with abnormal organic acids in vaginal secretions (24/25), with Gardnerella vaginalis on culture (17/25), with complaints of vaginal malodour (15/25), and with a relative scarcity of white blood cells in vaginal secretions. Anaerobic vaginal flora were presumptively identified by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of organic acids found in vaginal secretions. The clinical criteria used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis included the presence of at least three of the four following characteristics: (a) a vaginal pH greater than or equal to 4.5, vaginal secretions that (b) were homogeneous, (c) contained "clue" cells, and (d) released a "fishy" amine odour when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide. Because 17 of the 25 patients with clinical bacterial vaginosis had both chromatographic bacterial vaginosis and G vaginalis, causative organisms were difficult to identify. None of the six patients who had G vaginalis but not chromatographic bacterial vaginosis had clinical bacterial vaginosis, but seven of the 10 women with chromatographic bacterial vaginosis but not G vaginalis had clinical bacterial vaginosis (p less than 0.02, chi 2 with Yates's correction). This finding supports the recent suggestions that anaerobes are important in the production of clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  - Use of a sodium polyanetholesulfonate disk for the identification of Gardnerella  vaginalis.
AB  - Several methods have been previously suggested for the presumptive identification of Gardnerella vaginalis in clinical laboratories, but none is entirely satisfactory. We previously found that sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) inhibits G. vaginalis in blood culture media. We compared susceptibility to an SPS-containing paper disk with beta-hemolysis on human blood agar, hippurate hydrolysis, and inhibition by alpha-hemolytic streptococci for identification of 62 previously confirmed G. vaginalis strains. All strains were positive by SPS disk and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus inhibition, 78% were positive by beta-hemolysis, and 81% were positive by hippurate hydrolysis. Although positive reactions occurred with SPS disk and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus tests for 5 and 9 of 84 other bacteria tested, respectively, none of these bacteria were positive for both tests. We conclude that a combination of SPS disk susceptibility and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus inhibition provides excellent identification of G. vaginalis when performed by the methods suggested.
TI  - The association of sexually transmitted diseases with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a case-control study.
AB  - Thirty-three women with histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (grades I to III, with one case of microinvasive carcinoma) and 54 women without evidence of the disease were prospectively studied to determine the relationship of genital infection to cervical neoplasia. Demographic and sexual data for patients and control subjects were collected, with standardized clinical and colposcopic evaluation by means of predefined diagnostic categories. Cultures from the cervix were examined for herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Human papilloma virus infection was identified by characteristic changes of koilocytosis in cytologic or histopathologic specimen. Cultures from the vagina were evaluated for Gardnerella vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Candida albicans, and other yeasts. Separate Gram strains were prepared from endocervical secretions and from vaginal secretions. More lifetime sexual partners, larger area of transformation zone, evidence of human papilloma virus infection, and altered vaginal flora were observed in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The association of human papilloma virus infection and altered vaginal flora with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was independent of sexual experience.
TI  - [Etiology of bacterial vaginosis (non-specific vaginitis)].
AB  - 56 women who were diagnosed bioclinically as having a bacterial vaginal infection were studied, as were 35 women as a control group. The study was a semi-quantitative analysis of the vaginal bacterial flora, both aerobic and anaerobic. It shows that Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria such as Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides, Veillonella and Mobiluncus were associated in a statistically significant way with bacterial vaginitis. On the other hand Lactobacilli were less frequently found (p less than 0.001) than in the control group of women. The way in which the microbial flora is changed has been observed during attacks of vaginitis and is discussed, as is the importance of making the diagnosis and of treating this syndrome.

TI  - The treatment of Gardnerella vaginalis vaginosis: a randomized comparison of pivampicillin with metronidazole.
AB  - The efficacy of pivampicillin and metronidazole were compared in the treatment of Gardnerella vaginalis associated bacterial vaginosis. In a multicenter trial 86 women were given pivampicillin (P) 700 mg twice daily for 6 days and 86 women received metronidazole (M) 400 mg three times daily for 7 days. At control, 2 weeks from the start of treatment, patients in group P showed the best clinical results, 77.9% in group P vs. 64.0% in group M (p = 0.066). P showed a higher clinical efficacy than M, both in women using intra-uterine device and in patients using other forms of contraception. Negative post-treatment cultures were seen in 43% of women in group P and 64% in group M (p less than 0.002). Bacteriological cure was unrelated to disappearance of discharge, odour and itching, although it correlated significantly with a negative amine test (p less than 0.00005). Pivampicillin in the dosages used in the present investigation is a useful alternative to metronidazole therapy.
TI  - [Amine colpitis, not only an esthetic problem: increased infection risk in labor].
AB  - In 76 women with non-specific vaginitis we could always isolate Gardnerella vaginalis and several anaerobics, especially Bacteroides species, in hgh counts. In 19 puerperae, bacteriologial examinations of the infected episiotomy wound yielded a spectrum of pathogens similar to that of non-specific vaginitis. In 74 per cent of the women with wound infection following episiotomy, non-specific vaginitis had either already been present before childbirth (and identified as Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis), or was confirmed at the time of infection. Staphylococcus aureus was seen in 16 per cent of the wound infections, whereas other pathogens were identified in 10 per cent. In a prospective study on vaginal flora ante partum and rate of infection post partum, based on 405 vaginal deliveries, 80% of the examined pregnant women had a normal vaginal flora with lactobacilli. In 12%, we found Gardnerella vaginalis, and in 8% a mixed flora. Since the rate of infection in women with Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis and episiotomy was found to be ten times higher than that in women with Doderlein's flora and episiotomy, it is obvious that Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis is not just an aesthetic problem.
TI  - Vaginitis due to Gardnerella vaginalis and to Candida albicans in sexual abuse.
AB  - Sexually transmitted diseases may be transferred to children and adolescents during voluntary or involuntary sexual contact. Two children are reported with the unusual association of sexual abuse and Candida albicans or Gardnerella vaginalis infections. Awareness of the techniques for diagnosis of these infections is essential for appropriate management of the abused child. These organisms should not be considered normal flora when found in symptomatic children and adolescents and should raise the possibility of sexual abuse.
TI  - The prevalence, six-month persistence, and predictive values of laboratory indicators of bacterial vaginosis (nonspecific vaginitis) in asymptomatic women.
AB  - The natural course of signs and laboratory test findings indicative of bacterial  vaginosis was followed in an observational noninterventive 6-month longitudinal study of 270 asymptomatic women. Only the minority of positive Gardnerella vaginalis cultures (5 of 33), wet mount clue cells (5 of 14), sniff tests (3 of 11), Papanicolaou smear clue cells (0 of 5), and discharge consistent with bacterial vaginosis (11 of 49) persisted in the absence of therapy. While these four laboratory parameters as well as chromatographic succinate/lactate ratios (performed only on the final visit) were abnormal significantly more often in patients with abnormal discharge than in those with normal discharge (p = 0.006, p less than 0.0001, p less than 0.0001, p = 0.0003, and p = 0.002, respectively), all were insensitive predictors of abnormal discharge with sensitivities ranging between 10.6% and 20.2% and abnormal test predictive values between 30.6% and 65.2%. We conclude that G. vaginalis represents indigenous flora in some normal women and that therapy is unwarranted for the incidental finding of a positive laboratory indicator of bacterial vaginosis in the patient without symptoms.
TI  - Experimental infection of mares with Haemophilus equigenitalis.
AB  - Inoculation of Haemophilus equigenitalis into the uterus of 7 mares caused a disease clinically indistinguishable from contagious equine metritis. The duration of clinical signs varied from 4 to 11 days. The causative organism persisted for a relatively short time (2 to 10 weeks) in 5 mares, but in 2 others it established a carrier status and persisted until they were killed 6 and 10 months after infection. H. equigenitalis was recovered from the vestibule of the vagina and from a combined swab of the clitoral fossa and sinuses throughout the course of the infection. In some mares there were extended periods (2 weeks) when it could not be reisolated. All mares experienced a transitory serological response to infection. The complement fixation test was generally negative 12 weeks after infection whereas antibodies detected by the passive haemagglutination test and serum agglutination test were more persistent. In some animals the PHT and SAT titres increased during the breeding season following infection. The serological response did not appear to be related to the duration of infection.
TI  - Demonstration by electron microscopy of pili on Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Eight strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were examined by electron microscopy for the presence of pili. Narrow pili ranging from 3.0 to 7.5 nm in diameter were seen on bacteria from five of the strains studied.
TI  - [Microbiologic findings in vaginal discharges].
AB  - Microbiological examinations were performed in 247 women complaining of vaginal discharge. An average of 3.9 different organisms was isolated from each patient. Gardnerella vaginalis was found in 62.8% of all women. Candida spp. were seen in 22.7%. Trichomonas vaginalis occurred in 6.5%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae in 1.2%, Chlamydia trachomatis in 10.1%, Mycoplasmata in 13.8%, Cytomegalovirus in 2.8%, and Herpes simplex Type 2-virus in 1.1%. None of the above was found in 17.4% of the patients. Statistic evaluation revealed correlation between different pathogens and between pathogens and normal vaginal bacteria, e.g. a higher prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasmata and Bacteroides spp. in association with Gardnerella vaginalis, and a lower prevalence of Candida spp. and lactobacilli. A pathogenic role of the Mycoplasmata in connection with vaginal discharge cannot be supported by this study. The results of antimicrobial therapy are reported and discussed.

AB  - Samples from the posterior vaginal fornix of 102 women with various clinical conditions were analysed by a quantitative method. Aerobes were isolated from all but one of the specimens at a mean concentration of 7.2 log10 cfu/g and anaerobes from 92 specimens at a mean concentration of 8.1 log10 cfu/g. In most clinical conditions and in a control group of asymptomatic women, anaerobes outnumbered aerobes by about ten to one (one log10 unit). The most common organisms were aerobic and anaerobic lactobacilli, coryneforms, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides spp. and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. Lactobacilli did not appear to confer any protective effect by excluding the presence of other organisms such as Gardnerella vaginalis or anaerobes. The isolation of anaerobic organisms from the vagina cannot be regarded as being of pathogenic significance without other supporting evidence.
TI  - Activity of ciprofloxacin against genital tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the quinolone carboxylic acid, ciprofloxacin, against a  variety of genital tract pathogens was examined. Each of 35 isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including some beta-lactamase producing strains and strains resistant to tetracycline, was inhibited at a concentration of 0.01 mg/l. Most (13 of 20) strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were inhibited at 1 mg/l but three isolates had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 8 mg/l or more. Each of seven strains of Chlamydia trachomatis was completely inhibited at a concentration of 2 mg/l. Prolonged (72 hours) exposure of the chlamydiae to ciprofloxacin was required for inhibition at this concentration.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis infection--another sexually transmitted disease].
AB  - The Gardnerella vaginalis infection of the urogenital tract, an STD, is of clinical importance in females and of epidemiological importance in males. Females suffer from vulvovaginitis amine colpitis, with a bad-smelling grey vaginal discharge with a pH of 5.0-5.5, which contains "clue cells". The urethra of males is often asymptomatically infected. The identification of G. vaginalis is time-consuming and requires a lot of material. Isolation and identification of G. vaginalis can not yet be made in the routine examination of outpatients suffering from urogenital tract infections. If the diagnosis is based on signs such as bad-smelling grey discharge containing "clue cells", and the increase in pH about 20% false-positive and 20% false-negative results will be obtained. If G. vaginalis is isolated, simultaneous infections with further agents such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae etc., Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida species and HSV 2 should be excluded. Metronidazole (1 g/day for 5 days) is the drug of first choice in G. vaginalis infection.
TI  - A newly discovered sialidase from Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - A sialidase (neuraminidase, acylneuraminosyl hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.18) has been discovered and isolated from Gardnerella vaginalis (ex. Haemophilus vaginalis), a possibly pathogenic inhabitant of the female genital tract. Bacteria were grown in peptone-yeast-extract medium with 2.0 mM N-acetylmannosamine as enzyme inductor under CO2 atmosphere. Sialidase activity was found in the bacterial sediment and in the culture medium. The enzyme was liberated from the cells by ultrasonic treatment. Purification was performed by 60-80% ammonium sulfate precipitation and by column chromatography on Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G 200. The enzyme revealed a molecular weight in the range of Mr 75 000 and a pH optimum at 5.5. Among the different types of NeuAc-containing glycoconjugates, the enzyme exhibits its highest activities towards the globular glycoproteins alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and fetuin. Taking their cleavage rate as 100, it is around 55 for II3NeuAc-Lac, 45 for bovine submaxillary mucin, 35 for II6NeuAc-Lac and IV3, III6NeuAc2-LcOse4. The rates for III8,II3NeuAc2-Lac, gangliosides and colominic acid are below 20. Due to its specificity pattern, the enzyme may play a role in the pathogenic process of G. vaginalis infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis to thiamphenicol: clinical experience with nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - We compared the in-vitro activity of thiamphenicol against 100 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis with the activity of 11 other antimicrobial agents. The MICs for thiamphenicol ranged from 0.39 micrograms/ml to 6.25 micrograms/ml. The concentration at which 50% of strains were inhibited (MIC50) was 1.96 micrograms/ml, and the concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited (MIC90) was 3.93 micrograms/ml. All strains were very susceptible to erythromycin, chloramphenicol, beta-lactam antibiotics, and clindamycin. Tetracycline and metronidazole were only moderately active. In an attempt to cure G. vaginalis-associated vaginitis with a single-dose treatment, we administered 2.25 g of thiamphenicol to 20 volunteers; 17 were clinically and bacteriologically cured. In two cases we observed that G. vaginalis was not eliminated immediately (i.e., at the first follow-up visit), but we saw a progressive disappearance of the strain without further treatment. In one case the treatment seemed to have failed but reinfection could not be ruled out. The results show that a single dose of thiamphenicol can cure G. vaginalis-associated vaginitis.
TI  - Biotypes of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - A simple and reproducible scheme for identifying biotypes of Gardnerella vaginalis has been developed, based on reactions for lipase, hippurate hydrolysis, and beta-galactosidase. Among a total of 359 strains tested, eight biotypes were observed, the most common ones being types 1 (beta-galactosidase positive, lipase positive, hippurate positive), 2 (beta-galactosidase negative, lipase positive, hippurate positive), and 5 (beta-galactosidase negative, lipase negative, hippurate positive). The distribution in biotypes was similar among isolates from Antwerp, Seattle, and Nairobi. There were no differences in biotypes between strains isolated from patients with and without bacterial vaginosis (nonspecific vaginitis). Up to 14% of women with bacterial vaginosis harbored at least two different biotypes of G. vaginalis in the vagina. G. vaginalis strains isolated before and after treatment for bacterial vaginosis belonged to identical biotypes when the time interval between two specimens was less than 1 week. Similarly, G. vaginalis isolates from the vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis and from the urethras of their male sex partners belonged to identical biotypes when strains were isolated within the same 24-h period from both partners (P less than 0.005).

TI  - Microbiology of vaginitis associated with the intrauterine contraceptive device.
AB  - A malodorous, homogeneous, grey, thin and non-purulent discharge, which resembles non-specific vaginitis occurs in 20% of women with an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD); four times more common than in non-users. The aim of this investigation was to study the bacteriological aetiology of this IUCD-associated vaginal discharge, and to assess whether the infection was ascendent. No specific microbiological aetiology was found, but the normal, Lactobacillus-dominated microbial vaginal flora was replaced by Gardnerella vaginalis and certain anaerobic species in IUCD-users with the discharge. Clue cells, pepper-salt phenomenon and curved rods and/or fusiform-shaped rods demonstrated by microscopy, were typical of symptomatic patients. The endometrium and the IUCD were infected with these species in the symptomatic group more often than in IUCD-users who had no symptoms or in the control women who did not use the IUCD.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis bacteremia: a review of thirty cases.
AB  - The authors documented thirty cases of bacteremia, all in gynecologic and obstetric patients, over a four-year period at a university hospital. Sixteen of the patients had polymicrobial infections. Most of the patients recovered completely whether or not antimicrobial therapy directed against Gardnerella vaginalis was given. G vaginalis bacteremia may occur more often than has been reported.
TI  - An evaluation of single-dose metronidazole treatment for Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis.
AB  - A randomized, nonblinded study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole (Flagyl) versus a seven-day regimen in the treatment of "nonspecific" vaginitis. Using cultures for Gardnerella vaginalis, 14 (67%) of 21 women treated with the single 2-g dose and 19 (86%) of 21 women receiving the seven-day course were considered cured seven to ten days after treatment (P greater than .10). No difference in compliance was noted between the two groups, and the incidence of side effects likewise, was comparable.

G. vaginalis was not recovered from either tamarins or chimpanzees, but was recovered from each of 1O pig-tailed macaques inoculated with either of two freshly isolated Gardnerella strains, colonization persisting for 11-39 days. Examination of Gram-stained vaginal smears obtained from infected pig-tailed macaques failed to demonstrate clue cells, a feature which is pathognomonic of Gardnerella-associated vaginitis in humans. Other features characteristic of non-specific vaginitis, namely an increase in vaginal pH, and an increase in the ratio of succinate to lactate (S/L ratio) in vaginal fluid were not found. However, the physiology of the macaque vagina was found to be different from that of the human, the vaginal pH and S/L ratio of uninfected macaques both being higher than that seen in humans. The physiological differences between the macaque and human vagina may be due, in part, to a difference in their anaerobic vaginal flora. While these inter-species differences in vaginal physiology and microbiology limit the relevance of the pig-tailed macaque as a model of Gardnerella-associated vaginitis, the ease with which macaques are colonized with G. vaginalis may prove useful in studying bacterial adhesion and local immunity.
TI  - Assessment and management of vaginitis and cervicitis.
AB  - This article presents the assessment, management, client education, and psychosocial considerations related to trichomoniasis, candidiasis, Gardnerella vaginitis, and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea. The physiology of the vagina, approach to the history and physical exam, specimen collection, and laboratory diagnosis are included. Recommended treatment regimens and preventive behaviors are discussed in detail. The psychosocial impact to the client of having a discharge which may be a sexually transmitted disease is discussed.

TI  - Metronidazole in the treatment of non-specific vaginitis (NSV).
AB  - In a large multicentre study of 429 patients with the usual signs and symptoms of non-specific vaginitis (NSV), we studied the effect of different doses of metronidazole. The patients were divided into five treatment groups as follows: group A was given 400 mg metronidazole three times daily for seven days, group B 2000 mg as a single dose, group C 2000 mg on days 1 and 2, group D 2000 mg on days 1 and 3, and group E was given 1200 mg metronidazole once daily for five days. At follow up examination four weeks from the start of treatment, patients in groups D and E showed the best clinical results with cure rates of 94.0% and 93.6% respectively. In addition the rate of reisolation of Gardnerella vaginalis was lowest in group D. We therefore recommend metronidazole 2000 mg on days 1 and 3 as routine treatment for non-specific or vaginitis associated with gardnerella.

TI  - Fatty acid, polar lipid and wall amino acid composition of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Representative strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were degraded using both an alkaline and an acid methanolysis and the fatty acid methyl esters released examined by thin-layer and gas chromatography. The profiles obtained were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar and were comprised of straight chain saturated and unsaturated non-hydroxylated fatty acids with hexadecanoic acid (16:0) and octadecenoic acid (18:1) the major components. All of the strains contained very characteristic polar lipid patterns consisting of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, five partially identified glycolipids and an uncharacterised phospholipid. Analyses of wall amino acid preparations using gas chromatography showed that Gardnerella vaginalis strains contain major amounts of alanine, glycine, glutamic acid and lysine. The chemical data support the integrity of the genus Gardnerella.

TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis. The current opinion.
AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis, a gram-negative bacillus, was first described in 1954. The associated clinical entity, vaginitis, first described in 1955, is controversial. The disease has specific symptoms, signs and diagnostic criteria. It has a symbiotic relationship with anaerobic bacteria. Whether G. vaginalis is a pathogen or normal inhabitant of the vagina is a subject of debate. The term nonspecific vaginitis should not be used for G. vaginalis vaginitis. G. vaginalis is sexually transmitted.

TI  - [Role of Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes. Etiology of nonspecific colpitis].
AB  - Nonspecific vaginitis is a very common clinical syndrome. In patients with nonspecific vaginitis the normal, lactobacillus-dominated microbial flora is replaced by Gardnerella vaginalis and certain anaerobes, preferably bacteroides spp. The mechanisms by which anaerobes or Gardnerella vaginalis or a combination of these organisms produce the disease condition are still unknown. Treatment with ampicillin and certain other drugs is often effective, but metronidazole appears to be the most effective antimicrobial for this condition. The optimal dose and duration of metronidazole therapy require further study.
TI  - Isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis from routine genito-urinary tract specimens.
AB  - Routine screening of 2374 high vaginal swabs yielded 132 cultures (5.6 per cent)  which were positive for Gardnerella vaginalis. Thirty-four of the strains were isolated together with Candida albicans and 46 with Trichomonas vaginalis. One hundred and twenty (90.9 per cent) of the isolates were from females between the ages of 16 and 40 years. One hundred and nineteen (90 per cent) patients sought medical advice because of a history of discharge (88) or inflammation (31). The other 13 (10 per cent) had some other complaint or underlying disease. All 132 strains hydrolysed hippurate and fermented starch. Ninety-three (70.5 per cent) were isolated from swabs without clue cells. Seventy-seven were from nonpurulent samples; the remainder were from samples with varying numbers of pus cells. All but two strains appeared sensitive to metronidazole when tested with discs containing 50 micrograms, but none when discs contained 5 micrograms of the drug. During the study C. albicans was isolated from 571 swabs (24 per cent) and T. vaginalis was found in 112 (4.7 per cent); in 19 (0.8 per cent) swabs both were detected. Five of 71 (7 per cent) specimens of uncentrifuged urine with more than 100 pus cells/microliter and two of 30 (6.6 per cent) seminal fluids with moderate numbers of pus cells yielded moderate to profuse growth of G. vaginalis. The patients concerned were not receiving antibiotics and other significant organisms had not been found by conventional cultural techniques.
TI  - Biology of sexually transmitted diseases.
AB  - The clinical concept of sexually transmitted diseases describes a common mode of  transmission of pathogens spanning the full spectrum of medical microbiology. These organisms have few common biologic characteristics aside from their ability to colonize or invade particular anatomic sites. New information on the biology of sexually transmitted pathogens has led to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Understanding that patients with sexually transmitted pathogens may be asymptomatic or may be simultaneously infected with multiple organisms has important implications for epidemiologic control of these diseases.

AB  - Urologic complaints in both men and women may be related to sexually transmissible infectious agents that frequently cause vaginitis in women. The author reviews the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical presentations of the various types of vaginitis. Vaginal infections in women often have their counterparts in men. Control of these communicable infections requires a better understanding of the vaginitis syndromes.

TI  - Gardnerella-associated vaginitis and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - 12 patients with mild or moderate symptoms of Gardnerella-associated vaginitis were examined clinically and microbiologically on 52 different occasions, 27 of which were asymptomatic. The symptomatic state was defined by fulfilling at least three of the following criteria: (1) subjective symptoms; (2) pH above 4.5; (3) positive amine test, and (4) clue cells in wet smear. Variation of the vaginal microflora was considerable. No causative bacterial species could be identified. Microorganisms of the genus Bacteroides were significantly (p less than 0.02) more often found in the symptomatic condition. The presence of either peptococci , peptostreptococci or anaerobic streptococci was similarly related to symptoms (p less than 0.01). Lactobacilli were significantly more often present when the patient was free of symptoms (p less than 0.05). Gardnerella vaginalis was a common isolate whether the patient suffered from symptoms or not. It is concluded that the presence of this microorganism indicates a disturbed ecologic situation within the vagina, resulting in loss of predominance of lactobacilli and hence liability to develop symptoms.

TI  - Recovery of anaerobic curved rods and Gardnerella vaginalis from the urethra of men, including male heterosexual consorts of female carriers.
AB  - Three hundred and nine men attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases were studied regarding urethral colonization with anaerobic curved rods (CR), Gardnerella vaginalis, Bacteroides ureolyticus, as well as for chlamydiae and gonococci. Ten (3.2%) of the men harboured CR. All strains of CR were of the short variant (approximately 1 micron long). Fourteen (4.5%) men were culture-positive for G. vaginalis and 58 (18.7%) for B. ureolyticus. Of the four men who were culture-positive for CR, but not for any other of the above-mentioned microbes, four had urethritis. From the 309 men, gonococci were isolated from 20 (6.4%) and chlamydiae from 96 (31.1%). Of the 10 men with CR, two concomitantly harboured Chlamydia trachomatis, four B. ureolyticus, and one G. vaginalis. The corresponding figures for those men with urethritis and who were colonized with G. vaginalis only were one of six, and for those carrying B. ureolyticus 14 of 37. None of 19 male consorts of the same number of women, harbouring the long variant (approximately 4 microns) of CR and G. vaginalis, were culture-positive for these two organisms.
TI  - Motile curved rods in women attending a STD clinic.
AB  - Motile anaerobic curved rods were cultured from vaginal discharge of 19 of 262 women attending an STD clinic. In 26 women, motile rods were observed by examination of wet smears. In all 5 specimens culture-positive for motile anaerobic curved rods of the long type, motile rods were observed in the wet smears, while in only 6 of the 14 specimens culture-positive for motile anaerobic curved rods of the short type, were motile rods seen in wet smears.
TI  - Measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  - The detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating Streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. It is also useful in identifying Eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera Bacteroides, Clostridium, Actinomyces, and Bacillus. Currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. Starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. A 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. The reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees C. When dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees C for 4 weeks.
TI  - The bacteriology of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Even 70 years ago Gram-negative coccobacilli had been recognized in vaginal discharge and were cultured 30 years ago. The need to have blood in agar medium for cultivation suggested that the organisms might be a Haemophilus species. Later, however, growth characteristics and other features resulted in their being placed in the genus Corynebacterium, before it was realized that this was inappropriate and they were transferred to a new genus and species Gardnerella vaginalis. The organisms are Gram-variable, non-sporing, non-flagellate, non-motile coccobacilli of average size 0.4 X 1-1.5 microns. The cell wall is laminated and some strains possess pili. G. vaginalis is fermentative and dextrose, fructose, galactose, glucose, maltose, mannose, ribose and starch are most likely to be metabolized. However, published patterns of the sugars fermented vary widely and most workers do not rely on such tests as a means of identification. Of many other features exhibited by G. vaginalis, the following are outstanding: it does not produce catalase, cytochrome oxidase, hydrogen sulphide, indole, or urease. Nor does it degrade aesculin, liquefy gelatin, reduce nitrate, or decarboxylate arginine, lysine or ornithine. On the other hand, it is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, often causes beta-haemolysis and usually hydrolyses hippurate and starch. G. vaginalis is serologically heterogeneous and causes haemagglutination which is mannose resistant. It is resistant to several antibiotics, including amphotericin, colistin, nalidixic acid and gentamicin, which may be incorporated in selective media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteriology of the vagina.
AB  - Interest in the microflora of the vagina and cervix has stemmed from the recognition of its significant association with vaginal and upper genital tract infections. Yet a clear understanding of the range of microbial types which are consistent with a normal genital tract and the factors which control the flora are elusive. Different methods and study populations in the various studies of the vaginal flora often have produced divergent conclusions. Studies using improved bacteriologic culture techniques, however, indicate that the previously held assumptions (i) that lactobacilli are the only bacteria present in healthy women, and (ii) that Gardnerella vaginalis is the only species associated with bacterial vaginosis, were oversimplifications. Although the aerobic and anaerobic species isolated are similar, qualitatively speaking, there are marked quantitative differences in the flora between these two groups of women. Lactobacilli in high concentrations are the most prevalent species in the vagina of women without bacterial vaginosis, whereas lactobacilli are less prevalent, and anaerobes, mycoplasma, and G. vaginalis are more prevalent, and in higher concentrations, in the vagina of women with bacterial vaginosis.
TI  - Anaerobic curved rods in genital samples of women. Performance of different selective media, comparison of detection by microscopy and culture studies, and recovery from different sampling sites.
AB  - Anaerobic curved rods (CR) frequently occur in the vaginal flora of women with non-specific vaginitis, more recently referred to as bacterial vaginosis (BV). The reasons for difficulties in culturing CR include their anaerobic nature, slow rate of growth and presence in a highly mixed flora. The present study concerns the efficiency of three culture media--blood agar, a gonococcal medium, and Columbia agar--for recovery of CR. The possibility of improving selectivity by adding various antibiotics (e.g. nalidixic acid, colistin and tinidazole) to the media was also explored. The MICs for 157 CR strains and for 80 strains of anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria isolated from vaginal samples from women with BV were therefore determined. Columbia agar containing 1 micrograms/ml tinidazole in combination with either colistin (10 micrograms/ml) or nalidixic acid (15 micrograms/ml) proved the most efficient medium for recovery of CR. These antibiotic combinations effectively suppressed growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic cocci and species of Bacteroides.--In 291 women, comparison was made of the detection of CR morphotype bacteria in methylene-blue-stained smears and the results of vaginal cultures for CR. A long variant (2-4 micron) was found in 42% by direct microscopy and 43% by culture. A short variant (approx 1 micron), which, with two exceptions, was always concomitant with the long variant, was demonstrable in only 3% of vaginal smears and in 14% of the cultures.--Vaginal samples were approximately four times more often culture-positive for CR than were cervical samples from the same women.

TI  - Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy. An association with prematurity and postpartum complications.
AB  - Although bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common disorder associated with high concentrations of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms, BV has not yet been linked to infections outside the vagina. To investigate the association of BV with adverse outcomes during or following pregnancy, we analysed the prevalence of BV among women with and without premature labor, and early-onset postpartum endometritis. Bacterial vaginosis was identified by gas-liquid chromatographic criteria in 28 (49%) of 57 women giving birth at less than or equal to 37 weeks gestation or with birthweight less than 2500 g and in 27 (24%) of 114 women bearing an infant at term (p = 0.001). Organisms associated with BV, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and/or genital mycoplasmas, were recovered from the endometrium of 61 of 101 women with clinical signs of endometritis. G. vaginalis was the most frequent isolate from both the endometrium (38 patients) and the blood (8 patients) of women with postpartum endometritis. Bacteroides bivius was the most frequent anaerobic isolate from the endometrium (11 cases) and blood (4 cases). Patients with both G. vaginalis and anaerobes isolated remained febrile significantly longer after beginning antibiotic therapy than did other patients (57.1 hours. vs. 36.3 hours, p = 0.02). These data suggest that BV may be associated with prematurity and that BV may contribute to postpartum maternal infectious morbidity.
TI  - Vaginal colonization of pig-tailed macaques by Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Ten pig-tailed macaques inoculated intravaginally with Gardnerella vaginalis organisms were colonized for 11-39 days. In contrast, 4 tamarins and 3 chimpanzees inoculated similarly failed to become colonized. Examination of Gram-stained vaginal smears obtained from infected pig-tailed macaques failed to demonstrate clue cells, a feature which is pathognomonic of non-specific vaginitis in humans. Additionally, the pH value, the levels of non-volatile fatty acids and the anaerobic flora of the macaque vagina differed from these aspects of the human vagina. While these differences indicate that gardnerella-infected macaques are unsuitable as a model of gardnerella-associated vaginitis in humans, such animals may prove useful for studying selected aspects of the biology of G. vaginalis such as the adhesion and interaction of the bacteria with the vaginal mucosa.
TI  - The grivet monkey as a model for study of vaginitis. Challenge with anaerobic curved rods and Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The grivet monkey was used as an experimental model for vaginitis. Gardnerella vaginalis was used for challenge in one monkey. G. vaginalis plus a long variant (LCR) of a hitherto unclassified anaerobic curved rod (CR) in another 2 monkeys, this LCR alone in 2, a short variant (SCR) of CR in 2, and G. vaginalis plus SCR in one monkey. All the bacterial strains had been isolated from human vaginal specimens. In the 2 monkeys exposed to G. vaginalis plus LCR, distinct signs of bacterial vaginosis characterized by a thin, grey and translucent discharge appeared after 5 days and were still present at the end of the 6-week observation period. LCR alone produced, if anything, a slight increase in the vaginal discharge after about 4-5 weeks. In the remaining monkeys there was no increase of vaginal secretion. The CR could still be isolated at the end of the observation period. LCR persisted for 9 months in one monkey, without having produced any obvious signs of vaginitis, which, however, did appear when the monkey was challenged with G. vaginalis too. G. vaginalis could be recovered up to 12 days after incubation in the monkeys also infected with CR, but at no time from the monkey challenged with G. vaginalis only. Bacteria of the G. vaginalis morphotype could be observed in Gram-stained vaginal smears collected throughout the observation period. Although having certain limitations, the model would seem to be of use for the study of bacterial vaginosis. Such a model in primates has not hitherto been available.
TI  - Can Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic curved rods attach to vaginal epithelial  cells in vitro, resulting in clue cells?
AB  - Vaginal epithelial cells were taken from asymptomatic patients and from patients  with non-specific vaginosis. Four bacterial species-Gardnerella vaginalis, Wolinella succinogenes and short and long anaerobic curved rods-were tested in vitro regarding attachment to the epithelial cells. In most experiments the curved rods and W. succinogenes attached to the cells. Less often, incubation with G. vaginalis resulted in cell attachment. There was no difference in attachment ability between the short and long rods. Clue cells were not often produced in these in vitro experiments.
TI  - Studies on the mechanism of adhesion of Gardnerella vaginalis to human erythrocytes.
AB  - A quantitative method using radiolabelled bacteria was used to examine the adherence of Gardnerella vaginalis to human erythrocytes. Adherence was mannose resistant, but inhibited by D-galactose and D-galactosamine. It was independent of temperature, but reduced at pH 3. There was considerable variation in the adherence of different isolates of G. vaginalis to human erythrocytes.
TI  - Vaginal colonization with Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic curved rods.
AB  - Ninety-four women colonized with anaerobic curved rods (CR) and/or Gardnerella vaginalis, were studied. Of these women, 34 were culture-positive for the long variant of CR. Eight of these latter women also harboured the short variant of these bacteria. In women colonized with CR, none had a predominance of lactobacilli in their vaginal flora, which was the case in 26 of the 60 women not harbouring CR. G. vaginalis was isolated from all 94 women. Mycoplasma hominis occurred significantly more often in women colonized with CR and G. vaginalis as compared with women not harbouring CR, but who were colonized with G. vaginalis (p less than 0.0005). The recovery rate of chlamydiae and gonococci was remarkably low, i.e. the organisms were isolated from one case each. Women colonized with CR complained of foul-smelling vaginal discharge significantly more often than women not found to harbour such organisms (p less than 0.001). In all women with CR, the number of leukocytes per high-power field of vaginal secretion exceeded that of 'clue cells'. Such cells were found in all patients with CR, but not in women with a lactobacilli-dominated flora, despite the fact that they all harboured G. vaginalis. Bacterial vaginosis might be due to a symbiotic infection with G. vaginalis and CR, possibly in conjunction with other anaerobes and/or M. hominis.
TI  - Clinical aspects of Gardnerella vaginalis-associated vaginitis. A review of the literature.
AB  - Almost 30 years ago Gardner & Dukes introduced the term Haemophilus vaginalis vaginitis. Most authors agree that this disease entity is characterized by a malodorous, homogeneous, greyish-white discharge, displaying clue cells in the wet-mount preparation. The diagnosis can be made in the office, the microscope being the most important diagnostic tool. There still seems to be some controversy regarding cause and clinical manifestations of the condition. A lack of uniformity in case definition and laboratory methods is probably responsible. The use of the term non-specific vaginitis should be discouraged, the condition being a specific entity not accompanied by vaginitis. A new term, 'clue cell-positive discharge' (CCPD), is proposed.

TI  - Anaerobic vaginosis (non-specific vaginitis): clinical, microbiological, and therapeutic findings.
AB  - The effect of metronidazole on anaerobic vaginosis (non-specific vaginitis) was assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 40 women. 19 of 20 women given metronidazole 400 mg twice a day for seven days were clinically and microbiologically cured by the time they completed treatment. All 20 women given a placebo were treatment failures, but when they were given a single 2 g dose of metronidazole, 15 showed clinical and microbiological cure a week later. 14 of the responders showed a recurrence of infection a month after treatment; this was probably due to reinfection, although persistence of infection cannot be ruled out. Findings in the clinic correlated closely with subsequent microbiological results in 133 out of 140 patient-visits, which suggests that there is no need for expensive and time-consuming laboratory investigations in this condition.

AB  - In the vaginal washings of 100 women with symptomatic non-specific vaginitis a succinate/lactate ratio of greater than or equal to 0.4 had a diagnostic sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 83% for this condition. The predictive value of a positive test was 94%, but that of a negative test was only 55%. A strong association between the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, a vaginal pH of above 4.5, and amines was found not only in non-specific vaginitis, but also in trichomonal and gonococcal infection. A variety of primary changes may encourage the multiplication of both gardnerellae and anaerobes and their presence in non-specific vaginitis may be a secondary rather than a primary event.

AB  - The prevalence of nonspecific vaginitis was 24% among 98 randomly selected women  examined at a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases and 32% among 135 women with suspected cervicitis at the same clinic. Mycoplasma hominis was isolated more often and serum antibody levels to M. hominis were higher in women with nonspecific vaginitis than in women without nonspecific vaginitis. Similarly, the rate of isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis and the quantitative growth of G. vaginalis were higher for women with nonspecific vaginitis. Abnormal results of gasliquid chromatographic analysis of vaginal fluid and the presence of abnormal diamines in the vaginal fluid also were associated with nonspecific vaginitis and with the isolation of M. hominis, whether or not G. vaginalis was isolated. Further studies of the ecologic interactions among M. hominis, G. vaginalis, and anaerobes in nonspecific vaginitis are needed for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this syndrome.
TI  - Amine content of vaginal fluid from patients with trichomoniasis and gardnerella  associated non-specific vaginitis.
AB  - Amounts of putrescine, cadaverine, and tyramine were measured in vaginal washings from five patients with non-specific vaginitis (NSV) associated with Gardnerella vaginalis, five patients with trichomoniasis, and five healthy controls. Putrescine and cadaverine were present in all but one sample from the infected patients; tyramine was found in four of five samples from the women with NSV and in two of five samples from those with trichomoniasis. The mean cadaverine to putrescine ratio was significantly higher in the patients with NSV than in those with trichomoniasis. Samples from the five controls contained only very small amounts of any of the three amines. The amine content of nine of 10 samples from the infected women was reduced to normal values after metronidazole treatment. The possible sources of the amines from Trichomonas vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis are discussed with reference to the clinical response to treatment.
TI  - Unsuspected Chlamydia trachomatis in females attending a sexually transmitted diseases clinic.
AB  - One hundred and five women attending Auckland sexually transmitted diseases clinic were reviewed because of positive cervical cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis. Their average age was 19 years, 70% were European; 28% were Maori. In half the patients the positive culture was a chance finding and therefore treatment was delayed resulting in six patients (12%) developing pelvic inflammatory disease. Eight out of nine male contacts, subsequently traced, had asymptomatic urethritis, one having epididymitis. One patient had no evidence of urethritis but was chlamydia positive. Associated pathogens present in the women were Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26%), Trichomonas vaginalis (6%), Gardnerella vaginalis (46%) and Candida albicans (19%). These findings support a need for routine chlamydial testing in female patients attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics and epidemiological treatment of female contacts of men with non-specific urethritis.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis to cephradine.
AB  - The activity of cephradine and the influence of pH on its activity against 70 Gardnerella vaginalis strains were determined. Serial dilutions of cephradine (0.062 to 256 micrograms/ml) were incorporated into Dunkelberg agar, inoculated with a Steers replicator, incubated in 5% CO2 for 48 h, and examined. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the isolates were 16 and 8.0 micrograms/ml at pH 7.0 to 6.0 and 5.5, respectively.
TI  - Bacteriuria due to Ureaplasma urealyticum and Gardnerella vaginalis in women with preeclampsia.
AB  - Certain fastidious organisms such as U urealyticum and G vaginalis can be isolated from the aspirated bladder urine of pregnant women more frequently than conventional urinary pathogens such as Escherichia coli [1]. They can be isolated even more often from the aspirated bladder urine of patients with renal disease, but rarely from that of healthy men or nonpregnant women [2]. We investigated the incidence of bacteriuria due to these two organisms--particularly U urealyticum--in patients with preeclampsia. U urealyticum was isolated more frequently (rate, 20%), and usually in higher colony counts, from the urine of patients with preeclampsia than from that of healthy pregnant women (rate, 7%). G vaginalis was isolated with approximately the same frequency as U urealyticum from specimens of bladder urine; both organisms were isolated from the urine of 11 patients (eight healthy women and three with preeclampsia). High colony counts of G vaginalis were also found more frequently in patients with preeclampsia. In both groups other fastidious organisms were isolated in a total of only five patients, and in four of these five cases U urealyticum and/or G vaginalis were also isolated from the same specimen. Urine cultures were more frequently positive in patients with moderately severe hypertension (blood pressure, greater than 160/100 mm Hg) than in those with mild hypertension (blood pressure, 140/90-160/100 mm Hg, occurring in nine (53%) of 17 patients and in nine (26.5%) of 34 patients, respectively. This difference was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A placebo-controlled, double-blind comparison of tinidazole and triple sulfonamide cream for the treatment of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - Oral tinidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 5 days, was compared to triple sulfonamide cream inserted into the vagina twice daily for 7 days for the treatment of nonspecific vaginitis in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. At 1 and 3 weeks after treatment, 29 of 30 and 18 of 19 patients, respectively, who had been given tinidazole were cured, as compared to 16 of 27 and 6 of 14 patients, respectively, who had been given oral placebo together with a vaginal cream with or without sulfonamides (p less than 0.01 and p = 0.0015, respectively). At 3 weeks, five of nine women who had received vaginal sulfonamide cream and oral placebo had persistent nonspecific vaginitis, thus suggesting that it was not more effective than a vaginal placebo cream. Untreated nonspecific vaginitis and persistence of this syndrome were significantly associated with Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, clue cells, a vaginal pH of greater than or equal to 5.0, a succinate/lactate peak heights ratio of greater than or equal to 0.3, and the absence of lactobacilli on a vaginal smear.

AB  - Urethral and sub-preputial swabs from 150 men were examined. There was a strong association between the isolation of anaerobic bacteria, particularly Bacteroides spp, and a clinical diagnosis of balanoposthitis, non-specific urethritis (NSU), or both. Aerobic bacteria formed the predominant flora in 28 healthy controls whereas anaerobes were predominant in specimens from 79 patients with balanoposthitis, from 24 with NSU, and from 19 with both. Bacteroides spp were the commonest isolates in all patient groups; B asaccharolyticus, B melaninogenicus ss intermedius, B ureolyticus, and B bivius were the most common species. The results obtained with the two swabs were identical except that Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from the urethral swab only in five patients.
TI  - Semiquantitative culture of Gardnerella vaginalis in laboratory determination of  nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - To evaluate the usefulness of quantitative cultures of Gardnerella vaginalis in the laboratory determination of nonspecific vaginitis, the actual and relative numbers of G. vaginalis in genital cultures of a general patient population were assessed semiquantitatively, and the laboratory results were then correlated with the clinical findings. Of the 1,585 women studied, 417 (26.3%) yielded G. vaginalis in culture. Of these, only 113 (27.1%) were found to have symptoms and signs consistent with nonspecific vaginitis. G. vaginalis was obtained in pure or predominant growth from 87 of 100 consecutive cases with nonspecific vaginitis and 32 of 100 consecutive cases without the symptoms or signs of vaginitis (P less than 0.001). Hence, the positive predictive value of isolation of G. vaginalis in pure and predominant growths was determined to be 73% (87 of 119). Conversely, G. vaginalis was isolated in mixed or light growth significantly more often from asymptomatic women than from symptomatic patients, i.e., 68 versus 13 cases. Therefore, the negative predictive value of isolation of G. vaginalis in mixed and light growths was found to be 84% (68 of 81). Quantitation of the relative amount of G. vaginalis growth had higher predictive values as compared with the assessment of G. vaginalis growth alone. We conclude that quantitative culture of G. vaginalis is essential to obtain maximum reliability of culture results in the laboratory determination of nonspecific vaginitis. Although quantitated cultures of G. vaginalis have high predictive values, laboratory results must be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical findings.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis: pathogen or commensal?
AB  
TI  - Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by direct gram stain of vaginal fluid.
AB  - To determine whether bacterial vaginosis (BV), also known as nonspecific vaginitis, could be diagnosed by evaluating a Gram stain of vaginal fluid, we examined samples from 60 women of whom 25 had clinical evidence of BV and 35 had candidal vaginitis or normal examinations. An inverse relationship between the quantity of the Lactobacillus morphotype (large gram-positive rods) and of the Gardnerella morphotype (small gram-variable rods) was noted on Gram stain (P less than 0.001). When Gram stain showed a predominance (3 to 4+) of the Lactobacillus morphotype with or without the Gardnerella morphotype, it was interpreted as normal. When Gram stain showed mixed flora consisting of gram-positive, gram-negative, or gram-variable bacteria and the Lactobacillus morphotype was decreased or absent (0 to 2+), the Gram stain was interpreted as consistent with BV. Gram stain was consistent with BV in 25 of 25 women given a clinical diagnosis of BV and in none of 35 women with candidal vaginitis or normal examinations. Duplicate slides prepared from 20 additional specimens of vaginal fluid were stained by two methods and examined by three evaluators. Interevaluator interpretations and intraevaluator interpretations of duplicate slides were in agreement with one another and with the clinical diagnosis greater than or equal to 90% of the time. We concluded that a microscopically detectable change in vaginal microflora from the Lactobacillus morphotype, with or without the Gardnerella morphotype (normal), to a mixed flora with few or no Lactobacillus morphotypes (BV) can be used in the diagnosis of BV.
TI  - Unconventional bacteria in urinary tract disease: Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Bladder aspirate urine samples (N = 190) were cultured for the presence of fastidious microorganisms. These samples were obtained from patients with urinary tract disease in whom standard bacteriologic investigation had failed to indicate infection. Gardnerella vaginalis was recovered alone, or in association with Ureaplasma urealyticum from the bladder urine of 33% of patients with reflux scarring. G. vaginalis was localized to the upper urinary tract in 75% of these patients with bladder counts greater than 10(3) colony-forming units per milliliter. The results show that two fastidious microbial species, not conventionally associated with urinary tract infection, are recoverable from the upper urinary tracts of patients with so-called sterile pyelonephritis.
TI  - Isolation and identification of anaerobic organisms from the male and female urogenital tracts.
AB  - Since Bacteroides spp may play an important role together with Gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis and balanoposthitis, anaerobic organisms were isolated and identified from 34 female and 20 male patients attending a department of genitourinary medicine, and the results compared with the clinical findings and the presence of other routinely isolated pathogens. Twenty-three different organisms were recovered from 13 of the 20 men; of these organisms, 20 were of the Bacteroides spp. Most isolates were of the B melaninogenicus/oralis group, which forms part of the commensal vaginal flora in women. A definite association between the presence of anaerobes and other pathogens needs to be firmly established, as this obviously causes important complications in treating these conditions.
TI  - Microbiology of vaginal discharge in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - Among women attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Nairobi with vaginal discharge, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were isolated from the cervix in 32 (26%) of 122 and four (7%) of 58 women respectively. Infection with Trichomonas vaginalis, Candida albicans, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma spp were diagnosed in 42 of 122 (34%), 26 of 110 (24%), 75 of 100 (75%), and 42 of 89 (47%) women respectively. Mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 23 (26%) of 89 women examined for all microorganisms. Infection with N gonorrhoeae was significantly associated with abdominal pain.
TI  - [Sensitivity of Gardnerella vaginalis to antibiotics. Study of 40 strains isolated at the Purpan University Hospital Center of Toulouse].
AB  - 40 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to 10 antibiotics, by an agar dilution method. All strains were inhibited by 0,5 microgram or less of penicillin and ampicillin. Erythromycin was the most active of the antibiotics tested; for all strains the minimal inhibitory concentrations were less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml. All strains were inhibited by 8 micrograms of streptomycin per ml and 4 micrograms of chloramphenicol per ml. 50% of the strains were inhibited by less of 2 micrograms of tetracyclin and all strains tested exhibited MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms when tested against colistin, nalidixic acid and sulfafurazole. At least, 85% of strains were inhibited by 2 to 16 micrograms of metronidazole.
TI  - Single oral dose metronidazole therapy for Gardnerella vaginalis vaginitis in adolescent females.
AB  - This study briefly reviews Gardnerella vaginalis as a primary vaginal pathogen and assesses the efficacy and safety of therapy with a single, 2-g oral dose of metronidazole. Over a period of 20 months, 882 symptomatic adolescent girls had positive cultures for G. vaginalis. All were post-menarcheal. No other vaginal pathogen was isolated in 609. The total group had a second culture 5-7 days after treatment. Cultures taken after treatment were negative in 95% of those treated with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole. Symptoms abated with therapy and culture negativity. Side effects were limited to infrequent, minor gastric distress. Our results suggest the utility of a simplified, one-dose regimen with high efficacy, insignificant side effects, and a lower cost per patient than the current dosage schedule of 500 mg b.i.d. for 7 days.
TI  - Vaginal disease. Venereal and nonvenereal types.
AB  - Vaginal diseases are, in many cases, sexually transmitted. However, most can also be non-venereal and can occur in any age-group. Special care should be taken in examining and treating young females with vaginal disease, and the possibility of sexual abuse should be considered in this age-group. Finally, special attention should be paid to girls and women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero, as these patients have an increased risk of anatomic and reproductive anomalies.
TI  - Minimal criteria for the identification of Gardnerella vaginalis isolated from the vagina.
AB  - Vaginal swabs were examined for the presence of Gardnerella vaginalis. Of 294 isolates with appropriate colonial and cellular morphology subjected to an identification procedure, 203 (69%) were identified as G vaginalis. The 91 isolates not identified as G vaginalis were differentiated by their inability to ferment starch, cause diffuse beta haemolysis on human blood agar or hydrolyse hippurate. Other tests, often used in the identification of G vaginalis, were found to be insufficiently specific. Failure to ferment starch coexisted with failure to cause beta haemolysis and/or hydrolyse hippurate. The starch fermentation test may therefore be omitted. The tests for beta haemolysis and hippurate hydrolysis, being relatively simple to perform and interpret, are considered indispensable for the accurate identification of G vaginalis in the service laboratory.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in genital disease.
AB  - In a study of Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in non-specific vaginitis (NSV) and other genital disease 89 patients attending a genital medicine clinic had vaginal samples examined for conventional pathogens and for quantitative analysis of G vaginalis and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora. The overall incidence of G vaginalis was 20%; G vaginalis (mean concentration 7.0 log10/g of secretion) occurred predominantly in patients with NSV (57%) but also in sexual contacts of non-specific urethritis (NSU) (37.5%) and in patients with other conditions (11.8%). G vaginalis is therefore a relatively common isolate in patients with vaginal discharge. The concentration of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria ranged from 4.9-11.0 log10/g of secretion with an anaerobe-to-aerobe ratio of 10:1. Anaerobic bacteria, particularly anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (mean concentrations 7.7 log10/g), were present in patients with NSV and in association with G vaginalis, but they also occurred in other clinical groups and with other pathogens, particularly Trichomonas vaginalis. Anaerobic bacteria may therefore play an important role in the pathogenesis of vaginal infections.
TI  - Haemophilus influenzae in genitourinary tract infections.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae was isolated in pure or predominant culture from genital specimens from nine females and two males. Four of the females had vaginitis, two had IUD-related endometritis, one had an incomplete septic abortion, and one had probable urethral syndrome. Two males had urethritis.
TI  - Metronidazole.
AB  - Metronidazole, a nitroimidazole derivative, is a unique antimicrobial agent that  is active against both bacterial and parasitic organisms, although only the anaerobic members of these groups are susceptible. It has been used for the treatment of trichomoniasis for about 20 years and is also effective against amebiasis and giardiasis. More recently, metronidazole has emerged as a principal agent for the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections. It is highly effective against all species of anaerobes except certain non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli and cocci and is the only agent rapidly bactericidal against the Bacteroides fragilis group. Clinical studies have proved its efficacy in prophylaxis for elective colorectal surgical procedures and in the treatment of deep abdominal sepsis (usually in combination with another agent, such as an aminoglycoside). Metronidazole is the treatment of choice for nonspecific vaginitis that seems to be a mixed infection due to anaerobes and Gardnerella vaginalis. Adequate concentrations in the blood are produced after both oral and intravenous administration, and the side effects are infrequent and minimal.
TI  - Vaginal infections. How to identify and treat them.
AB  - Vaginal infection occurs at some time in the majority of women. Most such infections are caused by Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella (Hemophilus) vaginalis. Some less common--but in many cases increasingly prevalent--causes include herpes-virus type 2, papillomavirus, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma T strains, and toxic shock syndrome.
TI  - Problem-orientated categorisation of "other conditions" seen in a genitourinary medicine clinic.
AB  - The case sheets of patients coded as D2 (other conditions requiring treatment) and D3 (other conditions not requiring treatment) in 1981 were reclassified on a problem-orientated basis. Ten discreet categories were delineated with ease. Women with non-specific vaginitis and men with Gardnerella vaginalis urogenital infection, usually coded D2 or C4, should be reclassified under the C group of conditions as, for example, "Gardnerella or other bacterial genital infections." It is suggested that codes D2 and D3 be replaced by the following nine categories: genital skin lesions or rashes; genitourinary symptoms; enteric conditions; other sexually transmitted infections; normal genital architecture, congenital conditions, or unconfirmed genital discharges; asymptomatic patients attending for routine examination; uninfected contacts of patients with sexually transmitted diseases; psychosexual problems; and others.
TI  - The identification of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - A collection of 72 strains of catalase-negative gram-positive, -negative and -variable cocco-bacilli isolated from samples of vaginal discharge from women with non-specific vaginal infection was examined in an attempt to develop an identification system for Gardnerella vaginalis that could be used in a diagnostic laboratory. Carbohydrate fermentation tests were found to be poorly reproducible and of little differentiating value. Enzyme tests were found similarly unhelpful, as were many antibiotic-susceptibility and chemical-inhibition tests. However, seven tests--susceptibility to trimethoprim and two concentrations of metronidazole, growth in the presence of 2% (w/v) sodium chloride and on nutrient agar, lactic acid production from glucose and beta-haemolysis on human-blood agar--were used successfully in this study to separate G. vaginalis from catalase-negative coryneforms and lactobacilli. Of these tests, susceptibility to trimethoprim and metronidazole together with beta-haemolysis on human blood agar are the most likely to provide a rapid, accurate identification. A possible identification scheme is outlined.
TI  - [Infections in gynecology].
AB  - After the author had reviewed present ideas about infections he outlined the specific character and the role of the normal flora to be found in the cervix and in the vagina, as well as the common characteristics of sexually transmitted diseases. The pathogenic role of bacteria that were previously considered to be "innocent" (type B streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, Gardnerella vaginalis) and Chlamydiae and mycoplasmas make it easier to understand the pathogenesis of basal gynaecological infections and of the urethral syndrome. The author then studies the aetiology of acute salpingitis that can be classified according to a number of responsible organisms: monomicrobial salpingitis (due to gonococci, Chlamydia, and microplasmas) or polymicrobacterial, the nature (endogenous or exogenous) of the infecting agents and the role of iatrogenic factors (such as intra-uterine contraceptive devices, terminations of pregnancies and so on). The diagnosis and the risks of gynaecological infections occurring are pointed out as well as the different problems associated with preventing these infections.
TI  - [Gardnerella vaginalis. Frequency of its isolation from women complaining of leukorrhea].
AB  - A study was carried out on 131 vaginal swabs that were taken from 98 women who had a discharge and 33 women who were asymptomatic to determine the frequency in which Gardnerella vaginalis was discovered. This study shows that this bacteria is the only micro-organism that is found in a significantly higher number of women with nonspecific discharges (37%) than in those who have no discharge (9.1%). These results, while they do not show that Gardnerella vaginalis is the only aetiological factor in nonspecific vaginitis, do underline that it is a factor in thinking about such a syndrome and therefore it should be looked for by the laboratory and by the doctor treating patients.
TI  - Influence of metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiological flora.
AB  - In order to study the effects of metronidazole on the microbiology of the vagina  in general and on Gardnerella vaginalis infection in particular, quantitative aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were performed before and 4 weeks after initiation of metronidazole treatment, 400 mg three times daily for five days. Bacteriological results were compared with microscopic findings and with the results of "amine testing" with potassium hydroxide and with other clinical variables. We found a reasonably good correlation between the finding of clue cells, positive amine test and symptomatic Gardnerella infection. Treatment with metronidazole resulted in most cases in recolonization with lactobacilli and disappearance of clinical symptoms and findings, including clue cells, although G. vaginalis could still be detected.
TI  - The clinical signs and symptoms of Gardnerella-associated vaginosis.
AB  - Gardnerella-associated vaginosis (Hemophilus vaginalis vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge and odor. The clinical spectrum of this infection varies from total lack of symptoms to obvious odor and profuse vaginal discharge. The diagnosis of this syndrome can be made when a woman presents with a homogenous grey-white discharge that emits a fishy odor when a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide is mixed with a drop of vaginal discharge on a glass slide. The pH of this secretion is typically in the range of 5.0-5.5 as determined by indicator paper. The diagnosis is further confirmed when a microscopic examination of the discharge mixed with normal saline shows a virtual pure culture of tiny bacteria many of which are found clinging to vaginal epithelial cells forming the so-called "clue cells". Cultures to isolate Gardnerella vaginalis are unnecessary in clinical practice.
TI  - "Non-specific" vaginitis: a non-entity.
AB  - The author alleges that any knowledgeable physician owning a vaginal speculum and a microscope should rarely find the need for using the diagnosis, "non-specific" vaginitis, and that its too frequent use might well imply carelessness, indifference or a failure to employ available diagnostic methods. The suggestion is made that if the term "non-specific" vaginitis is to be retained in gynecologic nomenclature it should be assigned its rightful position and should include only those conditions without assignable etiology. The evidence shows that Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis, Corynebacterium vaginale) vaginitis is a precisely defined, specific vaginal infection, that the disease is sexually transmitted and that it accounts for most vaginitides previously classified as "nonspecific".
TI  - Microbial flora in women showing symptoms of nonspecific vaginosis: applicability of KOH test for diagnosis.
AB  - The microbial flora of the vagina in 100 consecutive patients coming to a gynaecologist's office because of excessive and malodourous vaginal discharge was investigated. Anaerobic bacteria were detected in 66% of cases, and Gardnerella vaginalis in 59% of cases. Lactobacilli were present in 52% of cases, Candida in 19%, Chlamydia trachomatis in 6% and Trichomonas vaginalis in 5%. Among the anaerobic bacteria, various strains of Bacteroides or Fusobacteria were the most common. The positive predictivity of KOH test varied from 86 to 98%. Its specificity was equally good, but its sensitivity was lower, in the range 66 to 76%.
TI  - A survey of genital infections in patients attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases.
AB  - 747 consecutive patients, 531 men and 216 women, attending the Division of Dermatovenerology, City Health Dept., Oslo, were screened for N. gonorrhoeae (14.5% and 18.5%), C. trachomatis (19.6% and 20.8%), G. vaginalis (0.2% and 6.5%), and C. albicans (1.1% and 21.3%). The prevalence is given in brackets for men and women, respectively. This study was undertaken in order to determine the relative prevalence of these microorganisms with particular reference to G. vaginalis, to determine the importance of concomitant infections, and the possible effect of contraceptive methods (oral contraceptives and IUD) on the prevalence of these microorganisms.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in the etiology of bacterial (nonspecific) vaginosis.
AB  - G. vaginalis was originally described as the etiologic agent of bacterial vaginosis (nonspecific vaginitis) because it was recovered only from women with signs and symptoms of "bacterial vaginitis" and not from normal controls. Recent data have shown that G. vaginalis is present in normal women but at concentrations lower than the limit of sensitivity of the media formerly used. Detection of low concentrations of G. vaginalis in normal controls has been made possible by development of a selective and differential medium (HBT). Anaerobically performed studies of the vaginal flora have indicated that while lactobacilli predominate in the normal vagina with or without G. vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria including Bacteroides spp., Peptococcus spp., Eubacterium spp. and curved rods as well as G. vaginalis predominate in bacterial vaginosis. Anaerobic bacteria and G. vaginalis are decreased after appropriate therapy. After treatment with metronidazole, lactobacilli again predominate. Lactobacilli are less prevalent after treatment with ampicillin or amoxicillin. These data suggest that as in infections at other mucous membrane sites, bacterial vaginosis is a mixed infection involving a finite number of facultative and anaerobic species. The data also suggest an important role for facultative lactobacilli.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis).
AB  - The controversy over the pathogenicity of Gardnerella vaginalis has a variety of  explanations, including difficulty in isolating the organism on cultures, failure to employ established criteria for recognizing the clinical entity, and failure of some to employ orthodox investigate protocols. Briefly reviewed is the evidence that the bacterium is the index organism of a precisely defined specific vaginal infection. Any thesis that anaerobic bacteria are co-pathogens and essential for establishment of the classic clinical entity G. vaginalis vaginitis is challenged. That anaerobic bacteria can live in symbiosis with G. vaginalis and that they may account for some variations in clinical features of the disease are consistent with the fact that various indigenous bacteria often modify the clinical characteristics of most specific infections of open body cavities. The author believes that G. vaginalis is never indigenous, that it is never commensal, and that it consistently induces a recognizable vaginal disease.
TI  - Characterization of Gardnerella vaginalis by gas chromatography.
AB  - The principal objective of this study was the characterization of Gardnerella vaginalis by gas chromatography. Thirty-eight isolates and the type strain, ATCC 14018, of G. vaginalis were studied. Hexadecanoic (16:0), octadecenoic (18:1) and octadecanoic (18:0) were the major fatty acids detected. Only insignificant differences between the various isolates could be found. The gas chromatographic analysis of G. vaginalis revealed a characteristic pattern. Gas chromatography in combination with selective growth conditions provides a method for rapid and exact identification.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of metronidazole and the hydroxy metabolite against Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - Metronidazole (M) (1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) undergoes oxidative metabolism with the formation of several metabolites, the most important quantitatively in serum and urine being the "hydroxy" metabolite (HM) (1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-hydroxymethyl-5-nitroimidazole). The antimicrobial activity of HM was compared with M against strains of G. vaginalis using minimal inhibitory (MIC) and bactericidal (MBC) concentration determinations and time-kill curve studies. At an inoculum of 10(6) colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml), and anaerobic incubation for 48 hours, the median MIC and MBC of HM were 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared to 4 and 16 micrograms/ml for M. HM also demonstrated a more rapid bactericidal effect than M in time-kill curves against exponential (10(6) cfu/ml) and stationary phase (10(10-13) cfu/ml) organisms. However, the cidal effect of HM against G. vaginalis was slower than that previously shown for M against obligate anaerobes such as B. fragilis. The degree of inactivation of both HM and M, determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, was similar during the time-kill studies and averaged less than 10% with exponential phase organisms and approximately 40% against stationary phase organisms after 48 hours' incubation. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that on usual dosage regimens of M used for non-specific vaginitis the serum levels of HM would likely exceed the MIC/MBC for most strains of G. vaginalis. Therefore, HM likely contributes a significant antimicrobial effect against this organism.
TI  - Current taxonomic status of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  
TI  - Metronidazole in treatment of non-specific vaginitis. Clinical and microbiological findings in ten patients given 2 grams of metronidazole.
AB  - A 2 gram single dose of metronidazole was given to ten patients suffering from nonspecific vaginitis. At follow-up a week later seven of these patients were clinically and microbiologically free from infection. The remaining three patients had persisting symptoms and both clinical and microbiological findings confirmed treatment failure. Despite the small numbers entered into the trial to date, a cure rate of only seven out of ten patients suggests that a 2 gram single dose of metronidazole is inadequate treatment for non-specific vaginitis.
TI  - Treatment of the Gardnerella vaginalis syndrome with a single 2 gram oral dosage  of metronidazole.
AB  - The Gardnerella vaginalis syndrome (GVS) is characterized by a smelly vaginal discharge of pH greater than 5.2. The microscopic appearance of the discharge is diagnostic. The Gram stain shows masses of small Gram variable bacilli which have a 'pepper and salt' pattern, and the wet film 'clue cells' and 'rafts' (floating clumps of small bacilli). The amine test is an additional diagnostic aid. 30 patients with this syndrome were treated with 2 g of metronidazole in a single oral dosage. 29 patients were cured at one week and 2 patients had a recurrence four weeks later.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  
TI  - Nonspecific vaginitis. Diagnostic criteria and microbial and epidemiologic associations.
AB  - Numerous previous studies of nonspecific vaginitis have yielded contradictory results regarding its cause and clinical manifestations, due to a lack of uniform case definition and laboratory methods. We studied 397 consecutive unselected female university students and applied sets of well defined criteria to distinguish nonspecific vaginitis from other forms of vaginitis and from normal findings. Using such criteria, we diagnosed nonspecific vaginitis in up to 25 percent of our study population; asymptomatic disease was recognized in more than 50 percent of those with nonspecific vaginitis. A clinical diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis, based on simple office procedures, was correlated with both the presence and the concentration of Gardnerella vaginalis (Hemophilus vaginalis) in vaginal discharge, and with characteristic biochemical findings in vaginal discharge. Nonspecific vaginitis was also correlated with a history of sexual activity, a history of previous trichomoniasis, current use of nonbarrier contraceptive methods, and, particularly, use of an intrauterine device. G. vaginalis was isolated from 51.3 percent of the total population using a highly selective medium that detected the organism in lower concentration in vaginal discharge than did previously used media. Practical diagnostic criteria for standard clinical use are proposed. Application of such criteria should assist in clinical management of nonspecific vaginitis and in further study of the microbiologic and biochemical correlates and the pathogenesis of this mild but quite prevalent disease.
TI  - Diagnosis and therapy of nonspecific vaginitis. Correlation between KOH-test, clue cells and microbiology.
AB  - A clinical and quantitative microbiological study was performed on 32 women with  fishy odour of the vaginal fluid. This odour could be intensified by the addition of one drop of 10% potassium hydroxide. Clue cells were found to be present in all cases. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from the vaginal fluid in 97%, and large quantities of mixed anaerobes in 100% of the patients. The therapy with metronidazole, 400 mg twice daily for 5 days, was successful in 22 out of 24 patients. After therapy the fishy odour and the clue cells were no longer detectable. G. vaginalis and anaerobes could only be isolated sporadically and in small quantities. The isolation rate of Lactobacillus species increased from 3% to 86% within one week.
TI  - Isolation and identification of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  
TI  - Comparison of two different regimens of metronidazole in the treatment of non-specific vaginitis.
AB  - 25 patients with symptoms of non-specific vaginitis have been treated with metronidazole either 2000 mg in a single dose or 400 mg three times daily for 5 days. Diagnosis was settled by 1) identification of G. vaginalis in culture of vaginal secretion, 2) the observation of clue cells in wet smear, 3) a positive amine test on application of potassium hydroxide, and 4) increased pH in the vaginal secretion. Most patients' symptoms and complaints disappeared and at the same time most of the tests used changed from abnormal to normal findings. No side effects were recorded. It is concluded, that metronidazole in either dose was a useful treatment of non-specific vaginitis.
TI  - Treatment of non-specific vaginitis with a single dose of tinidazole.
AB  - In a double-blind, randomized trial twenty-six patients with non-specific vaginitis were treated with tinidazole/placebo (4 X 500 mg in one single dose). Thirteen patients received placebo, of which one was cured. Thirteen patients received tinidazole, of which six were cured. The nineteen non-responders received tinidazole (4 X 500 mg in one single dose), which resulted in the cure of eight patients (seven from the original placebo-group and one from the original tinidazole-group). Of the eleven patients not responding to tinidazole seven were successfully treated with metronidazole (250 mg, 4 times daily, for one week).

TI  - Nonspecific vaginitis in an outpatient clinic. Comparison of three dosage regimens of metronidazole.
AB  - Nonspecific vaginitis causes diagnostic as well as therapeutic difficulties in gynecological private practice. In a study in 63 patients with "nonspecific" vaginitis, clinical parameters were related to the bacteriological isolation of G. vaginalis in order to try to find criteria which can help to make a correct diagnosis of "nonspecific vaginitis". These patients were treated with three different regimens of metronidazole, either 2000 mg as a single dose, or two single doses of 2000 mg each taken the first and the third day, or 400 mg 2 times daily for 7 days. Patients with Candida or Trichomonas infections were excluded. Partners were treated at the same time, with the same regimen as the patient. The patients were controlled 14 and 28 days after the beginning of the treatment. The preliminary results showed that all regimens give good clinical effect, but the treatment with 2000 mg given as a single dose the first and the third days seems to lead to fewer failures.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria as cause of infections in female genital organs.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria constitute a substantial component of the normal vaginal flora and of the outer cervical canal. Consequently, one would expect infections emanating from the vaginal flora to be caused to a substantial degree by anaerobic bacteria. The anaerobes may contribute in colpitis, but their role is difficult to prove in this situation, since sampling only yields normal flora components. One clue that anaerobes may contribute to colpitis is the circumstance that the flora under those conditions differ from the normal situations. Another is the circumstance that metronidazole, which only inhibits anaerobes, does reduce symptoms e.g. of colpitis in the presence of the microaerophilic Gardnerella vaginalis, which is resistant to metronidazole (but sensitive to the metabolite hydroxymetronidazole). In the US, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is to a substantial degree apparently caused by anaerobic bacteria. Our experience in Scandinavia indicates that anaerobes are of neglible importance in this condition, since we rarely isolate anaerobes in spite of adequate sampling, transport and processing of specimens. We mostly find anaerobes in post-operative PID when the vaginal wall has been passed, or as a complication of pregnancy (puerperal fever, early rupture of membranes, abortion), and in connection with intrauterine devices. The role of anaerobes in bartholinitis is established. PID may be associated with appendicitis or colonic diverticulosis. Anaerobes are regularly isolated from abscesses developing in the pelvic organs. This also applies to tuboovarial and vulvovaginal abscesses. The most important anaerobic bacteria in infections of the female genital organs are Bacteroides fragilis and other species of the fragilis group, B. melaninogenicus and related species, other Bacteroides, peptococci and peptostreptococci. Clostridium perfringens rarely cause infections of female genital organs, although such conditions have a dramatic course.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis-associated vaginitis--a 'new' sexually transmitted disease.
AB  
TI  - Detection of Gardnerella vaginalis on vaginal smears by immunofluorescence.
AB  - An indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA) test was developed for the detection of Gardnerella vaginalis. Antisera were prepared in rabbits by using five strains of G. vaginalis. A pool of the antisera was tested for specificity with a variety of isolates known to colonize the human vagina and (or) morphologically resemble G. vaginalis. Six heterologous bacterial isolates reacted with the pooled antiserum at dilutions of 1:10, but none reacted at the working dilution of 1:200. Vaginal swab specimens were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in order to further evaluate the IFA procedure. The presence of G. vaginalis in the specimens was determined both by culture and by the IFA procedure. Absorbed antisera reacted with all isolates of G. vaginalis tested. In a clinical trial the IFA procedure detected the presence of G. vaginalis in smears from 23 (24.2%) of the patients with nonspecific vaginitis (NSV), from 22 (29.8%) of the asymptomatic individuals tested, and from 3 patients with vaginitis other than NSV. The presence of G. vaginalis in smears as detected by the IFA procedure was confirmed by cultures in all cases using Vaginalis agar supplemented with colistin and nalidixic acid (V-CNA). It is suggested that the IFA procedure may be of use in conjunction with V-CNA in epidemiological studies of the carriage and transmission of G. vaginalis in human populations. It appears that the IFA procedure, at least in our hands, is a useful test for the rapid detection of G. vaginalis even when this microorganism is not the predominant colonizer of the human vagina.
TI  - Comparison of mid catheter collection and suprapubic aspiration of urine for diagnosing bacteriuria due to fastidious micro-organisms.
AB  - We examined 40 female patients for the presence of fastidious bacteria in the bladder by culture of mid catheter and suprapubic aspiration urine specimens. Gardnerella vaginalis and Ureaplasma urealyticum were the most frequently isolated fastidious species. The suprapubic aspirate was positive in 3 patients with more than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml. Gardnerella vaginalis and 7 with more than 10(2) colony-forming units per ml. Ureaplasma urealyticum in the mid catheter urine specimen, while it was negative for bacteria in 6 patients with less than 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. coryneform bacilli or lactobacilli in the mid catheter urine specimen. The results show that culture of mid catheter urine samples provides a reasonable guide to the presence of bacteriuria owing to fastidious micro-organisms and can be used when a suprapubic aspiration specimen cannot be obtained easily.

TI  - Chlamydia trachomatis infections in women with urogenital symptoms.
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 30 to 100 women attending a family physician's office with dysuria, frequency or vaginal discharge, compared with 2 of 30 asymptomatic women. Multiple infections were common: C. trachomatis coexisted with Gardnerella vaginalis, Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis or a bacterial cause of urinary tract infection in 15 patients. C. trachomatis was isolated alone from 15 symptomatic women. The source of the positive culture was not always the site of symptoms. C. trachomatis was isolated from both the cervix and the urine of 9 patients, either simultaneously or sequentially. The probability of finding a chlamydial infection was 30% in young women with vaginal discharge alone, 33% in those with dysuria and frequency alone and 53% in those with abdominal or pelvic pain in addition to lower urogenital tract symptoms.
TI  - The vaginal microbial flora in non-specific vaginitis.
AB  - The facultative and strictly anaerobic vaginal microbial flora was investigated in 40 women with non-specific vaginitis and in 40 control women seen in private gynaecological practice. Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, anaerobic gram-negative and gram-positive cocci were all associated with non-specific vaginitis (p less than 0.001), whereas lactobacilli occurred less frequently in non-specific vaginitis than in controls (p less than 0.01). The most common anaerobes were Veillonella parvula, Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides assaccharolyticus, Bacteroides capillosus and Peptococcus asaccharolyticus. Anaerobic gram-negative curved rods were found in 11% of cases of non-specific vaginitis. A characteristic pattern of short chain organic acids was found on gas liquid chromatographic analysis of vaginal secretions in non-specific vaginitis. A succinate/lactate peak ratio of 0.3 or more was found in 75% of women with non-specific vaginitis (p less than 0.001). Clue cells, a positive amine test, a pH higher than 5.0, and the absence of lactobacilli on a Gram stained vaginal smear strongly correlated with non-specific vaginitis (p less than 0.001).
TI  - Comparison of microscopic and cultural findings in the diagnosis of Gardnerella vaginalis infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of Gardnerella vaginalis infection on the basis of microscopic and  cultural findings was compared. A total of 340 specimens of vaginal secretion were Gram stained and plated on a medium selective for Gardnerella vaginalis. Positive culture was obtained in 165 cases. Microscopy was unequivocally positive in 95, doubtful in 58 and negative in 187. Positive microscopy was confirmed by culture in 99%. On the other hand, 21% of the negative microscopy results gave a false negative diagnosis. Specimens for which microscopy was doubtful were culture positive in 53% of the cases, including 12% with heavy growth. Thus, positive microscopy proved to be sufficient for a reliable diagnosis of Gardnerella vaginalis infection. However, in specimens with negative or doubtful microscopic findings, additional culture is recommended.

TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis and its clinical syndrome.
AB  - The Gardnerella vaginalis syndrome is a well defined but benign condition characterized by a smelly vaginal discharge of pH greater than 5.0. It is not associated with inflammation. It often occurs in association with cervical infections. The microscopic appearance of the discharge is typical and diagnostic. The wet mount shows "clue cells" and "rafts" (floating clumps of small bacilli) and the Gram stain has the "pepper on salt" pattern of masses of small gram-variable bacilli. The amine test is an additional diagnostic aid. Cultures are useful but not necessary for diagnosis. The treatment of choice is oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for five days.
TI  - In vitro activity of seventeen antimicrobial agents against Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The in vitro activity of 17 antimicrobial agents was tested against 25 clinical isolates of Gardnerella vaginalis. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution. The isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, N-formimidoyl-thienamycin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and erythromycin. MIC90 for the beta-lactam antibiotics ranged from 0.12 mg/l for penicillin to 2 mg/l for ticarcillin. Cefoperazone was the most active cephalosporin, inhibiting all isolates at 1.0 mg/l. N-formimidoylthienamycin was the most active of the newer beta-lactam compounds inhibiting all isolates with a concentration of 0.5 mg/l. Clindamycin and erythromycin were highly active, inhibiting all isolates at 0.6 mg/l. Susceptibility to tetracycline, gentamicin, metronidazole and tinidazole varied between strains. All isolates were resistant to rosoxacin. The hydroxy-metabolites of metronidazole and tinidazole were more active than the parent compounds, inhibiting all isolates.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics of metronidazole and its principal metabolites and their activity against Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The hydroxy metabolite of metronidazole was found to be more active against 21 strains of Gardnerella vaginalis than the parent compound and less affected by culture in carbon dioxide. After 400 mg oral metronidazole (Flagyl) plasma concentrations of the two agents were below the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for most G vaginalis strains tested. With 2 g metronidazole the plasma concentrations exceeded the MICs of the more sensitive strains. Even with the lower dose of metronidazole clinically useful concentration of metronidazole and its hydroxy metabolite were present in the urine. Urinary excretion of these compounds may contribute to the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of vaginitis associated with G vaginalis.
TI  - Male carriage of Gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  - The prevalence of Gardnerella vaginalis in the urethra of 430 men attending a clinic for sexually transmitted disease was 11.4%; it was significantly higher in heterosexuals (14.5%) than in homosexuals (4.5%). There was no evidence of rectal or subpreputial carriage of G vaginalis, and urethral carriage was not associated with symptoms of urethritis.
TI  - Rapid microbiochemical method for identification of Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis.
AB  - A rapid biochemical method for the identification of Gardnerella vaginalis has been developed. The method is based on the fermentation of starch and raffinose and on the hydrolysis of hippurate. With this new procedure, identification was confirmed for 390 of 396 G. vaginalis isolates within 1 h after their inoculation into the three substrates.
TI  - Gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, and vaginal discharge.
AB  
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of Gardnerella vaginalis and Bacteroides organisms, associated with nonspecific vaginitis, to sulfonamide preparations.
AB  - Recent reports suggest that anaerobic Bacteroides organisms are frequently found  with Gardnerella vaginalis in nonspecific vaginitis. Specimens taken from 96 women with vaginal discharge were tested simultaneously for these organisms. G. vaginalis was found in 73% of the specimens, Bacteroides was found in 53%, and both organisms were found in 47%. Sulfonamides have been widely used in the successful treatment of vaginitis. Paradoxically, G. vaginalis is reported to be resistant, and it has been suggested that it could be the vehicle of the drugs which effects the cure. Little is known of the susceptibility of vaginal anaerobes to the sulfonamides. G. vaginalis and Bacteroides isolates were therefore tested in vitro against the individual excipients of sulfonamide tablets, and minimal inhibitory concentration tests were also performed against the three active drugs. The excipients had no effect on G. vaginalis, but Bacteroides strains were susceptible to the urea component. All strains of both organisms were susceptible to at least two of the three sulfonamides at high concentrations.
TI  - [Incidence and clinical importance of Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginalis) (author's transl)].
AB  - In 250 women aged between 16 and 55 years who came to a gynaecologist we looked for haemophilus vaginalis. In 9.6% it was possible to culture haemophilus vaginalis. The comparison of the differential vaginalis (V-)medium of Greenwood with the starch medium of Smith showed the much better resolution of the Greenwood medium. In one-half of the patients with haemophilus vaginalis there was no clinical evidence of pathogenicity of the bacterium, whereas in the other half, there was only a slight symptomatology. Haemophilus vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus seem to exclude each other. The strains of haemophilus vaginalis were resistant to sulfonamides, polymyxin B and aminoglycoside antibiotics.
TI  - Comparison of culture and microscopy in the diagnosis of Gardnerella vaginalis infection.
AB  - A comparison was made between human blood agar containing amphotericin B, nalidixic acid and either gentamicin or colistin for the isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis from cases of non-specific vaginitis seen in a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. The medium containing gentamicin was more inhibitory for non-Gardnerella species, but not sufficiently inhibitory to allow direct plating in the clinic without spreading for single colonies. The diffuse beta haemolysis produced by G vaginalis on human, but not on horse blood agar, proved very useful in differentiating it from other vaginal organisms and was not affected by the antibiotics used. This characteristic, together with Gram stain morphology, oxidase and catalase, provides a simple, reliable methods of identifying G vaginalis. Sixty women with symptoms of vaginitis, in whom no other pathogen was isolated, were examined by culture and microscopy. Gardnerella vaginalis was grown from 45 whereas only 31 had positive microscopy (clue cells or Gram-variable bacilli). There was no significant difference between the rate of isolation of G vaginalis in the group with positive microscopy (25/31) and that with negative microscopy (20/31).
TI  - Vaginitis in sexually active women: relationship to nine sexually transmitted organisms.
AB  - Women seen for symptoms suggestive of vulvovaginitis were studied for the detection of Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum, yeast, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, aerobes, anaerobes, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Asymptomatic women who reported to be sexually active and agreed to undergo comprehensive genital cultures were used as controls. There was a significant association of vulvovaginitis with the recovery of sexually transmitted organisms. However, all organisms were also recovered from asymptomatic patients. A total of 468 sexually transmitted organisms were recovered from 253 symptomatic patients (1.85 organisms per patient), while 125 were recovered from 130 asymptomatic patients (0.96 organisms per patient). The difference in prevalence between symptomatic and asymptomatic women for Chlamydia trachomatis, group B streptococcus, and the mycoplasmas was not statistically significant. Factors that predispose patients to the manifestations of symptoms are not clearly understood.
TI  - Method for isolation of gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis). Characterization of isolates by gas chromatography.
AB  - A method for the isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis) is presented. Bacteria isolated from 48-hour cultures grown on human blood agar were identified by means of beta-hemolysis, colony morphology, sensitivity to antimicrobial agents, oxydase and catalase reactions. Thirty-eight clinical isolates and one test strain were examined for fatty acid composition. Hexadecanoic (16:0), octadecenoic (18:1) and octadecanoic (18:0) were the major fatty acids. Also present, but in minor quantities, were myristic (14:0), hexadecenoic (16:1) and octadecadienoic (18:2) acids. Only insignificant differences between isolates could be detected. No hydroxy fatty acids commonly found in gram-negative bacteria were encountered. Gas chromatographic analysis of G. vaginalis revealed a characteristic and relatively simple pattern. The results support the use of the isolation method, which provides conditions highly selective for G. vaginalis.
TI  - Balanoposthitis associated with Gardnerella vaginalis infection in men.
AB  - Fourteen of 194 (7.2%) consecutive unselected men had positive culture results from genital swabs for Gardnerella vaginalis. A higher yield of isolates was obtained from preputial (93%) than from urethral swabs (64%). Of the 14 men, two had no detectable genital abnormality, eight non-gonococcal urethritis, and nine balanoposthitis. The urethral isolation rates for G vaginalis in men with and without non-gonococcal urethritis were not significantly different, but preputial isolation rates were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in men with balanoposthitis than in those without. The prevalence rate for G vaginalis in men with non-candidal balanoposthitis was 31%. In a second study, concomitant Bacteroides species were isolated in preputial swabs from nine of 12 (75%) men with G vaginalis-associated balanoposthitis and may play a role in its pathogenesis.
TI  - Polymicrobial nature of vaginitis in young women: a microbiological and therapeutic study.
AB  - Thirty-six young females attending the Student Health Service with vaginitis were investigated by serial semiquantitative aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, mycoplasma and viral cultures over a 10 day period and results were correlated with signs and symptoms. Antifungal therapy (econazole pessaries and cream) resulted in clearance of candida from 13 out of 16 patients where there was no increase in the anaerobic flora. In the four subjects where candida was isolated along with Gardnerella vaginalis plus abnormal anaerobic flora, only one cleared with econazole, the remaining three clearing during therapy with metronidazole. In the nine subjects with Gardnerella vaginalis and abnormal anaerobic flora, metronidazole relieved symptoms despite failure to eradicate G. vaginalis in seven indicating the pathogenic role of the anaerobic flora rather then G. vaginalis. Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and gram negative enteric bacilli were not implicated as primary agents in causing vaginitis.

TI  - Aetiology and management of non-specific vaginitis.
AB  - In a study of 100 women with non-specific vaginitis, characterised by a vaginal discharge which was malodorous and pruritic in most cases and caused dyspareunia and dysuria in some, Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 46% of patients. When present, G vaginalis was significantly associated with Mycoplasma hominis and Bacteroides species. Isolation of G vaginalis was unrelated to the presenting symptoms. Treatment with povidone-iodine pessaries for two weeks produced no pronounced benefit, either clinically or microbiologically, compared with a placebo. Nevertheless, 68% of all patients followed reported improvement four weeks after the start of treatment. The findings suggest that G vaginalis is one cause of non-specific vaginitis, which is more likely to be seen in women using oral contraceptives and is usually cured spontaneously.

TI  - Comparison of bacterial and fungal adherence to vaginal exfoliated epithelial cells and human vaginal epithelial tissue culture cells.
AB  - The adherence of four bacterial species and Candida albicans to a new in vitro tissue culture model of human vaginal stratified squamous epithelium was investigated and compared with in vitro adherence to vaginal exfoliated cells. Gardnerella vaginalis, group B streptococci, Lactobacillus sp., and C. albicans adhered well to both exfoliated and tissue culture cells. Similarly, a piliated fecal isolate of Escherichia coli, but not a nonpiliated vaginal isolate of E. coli, adhered well to both cell types. Adherence of the piliated E. coli was markedly inhibited by preincubation of bacteria with D-mannose. No inhibition of adherence by D-mannose of G. vaginalis, nonpiliated E. coli, and C. albicans was demonstrated. Scanning electron microscopy of tissue cultures showed nonuniform distribution of adherent microorganisms with diminished adherence in areas of active mitosis and proliferation and increased adherence to mature flat cells, often in the process of desquamation.

AB  - Gardnerella vaginalis is usually associated with nonspecific bacterial vaginitis. This paper presents a CAPD patient with peritonitis due to G. vaginalis. The infection route remained speculative. Treatment with gentamicin was not successful while the clinical signs of peritonitis disappeared within 24 hours after starting cefazolin.
TI  - Identification of Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis.
AB  - Different tests for the identification of Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis and for its differentiation from catalase-negative unclassified coryneforms from the vagina were evaluated on over 200 bacterial strains, with special emphasis on optimal test conditions. A presumptive identification of G. vaginalis in the clinical laboratory can be made on the basis of colonial morphology, clear beta-hemolysis with diffuse edges on human blood bilayer-Tween agar, a negative catalase test, and typical cell morphology in the Gram stain. This procedure will correctly identify 90 to 98% of suspect colonies of G. vaginalis with human blood bilayer-Tween agar as primary isolation medium. Useful additional reactions for the confirmation of G. vaginalis include positive hippurate and starch hydrolysis, positive alpha-glucosidase but negative beta-glucosidase tests, the production of acid from glucose and maltose but not from mannitol, and susceptibility to disks containing metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides, and bile.
TI  - Selective differential human blood bilayer media for isolation of Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis.
AB  - New selective and differential human blood bilayer agar media with Tween 80 (HBT  medium) or without Tween 80 (HB medium), developed for the isolation of Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis, permitted significantly higher G. vaginalis isolation rates than have been obtained for other media used for this purpose. HB medium consists of a basal layer of Columbia agar base containing colistin and naladixic acid with added amphotericin B and an overlayer of the same composition plus 5% human blood. HBT agar also contains Proteose Peptone No. 3 (Difco Laboratories) and Tween 80 in the basal layer and the overlayer. Both Tween 80 and the bilayer composition enhanced G. vaginalis production of human blood hemolysis, permitting detection of this organism even in the presence of heavy growth of other vaginal flora. The use of HB or HBT medium thus permitted the demonstration that G. vaginalis was present in vaginal fluid from a large percentage (up to 68%) of normal women. However, the concentration of G. vaginalis was found by semiquantitative analysis to be significantly higher in vaginal fluid from women with nonspecific vaginitis than in fluid from normal women.

TI  - Current therapy of vulvovaginitis.
AB  - Trichomoniasis is reliably treated with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole; however, with this regimen simultaneous treatment of sexual partners is particularly important. Trichomoniasis in pregnant women, who should not receive metronidazole, might be treated initially with clotrimazole vaginal suppositories, which appear to cure about 50% of cases. Topical antifungal agents of the imidazole class are superior to polyenes in treating vulvovaginal candidiasis. Boric acid powder applied intravaginally in gelatin capsules for 14 days appears as effective as imidazoles. Nonspecific vaginitis is now recognized as involving infection with anaerobic bacteria of the vaginal flora as well as Gardnerella vaginalis. The condition is most successfully treated with a seven-day course of metronidazole, which probably acts by eradicating the anaerobes. In addition, metabolites of metronidazole may act directly on G. vaginalis. Sulfanilamide-aminacrine-allantoin preparations are much less effective than specific therapies and have no role in the treatment of vulvovaginitis.
TI  - The effect of a contraceptive vaginal ring and oral contraceptives on the vaginal flora.
AB  - Premenopausal women seeking a steroid contraceptive method were allowed to choose between a contraceptive vaginal ring (CVR) containing levonorgestrel and estradiol used in a 3-week in, 1-week out regimen (n=20) and an oral contraceptive (OC) containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol in a 28-day regimen (n = 10). Cultures from the posterior vaginal fornix were obtained before therapy in both groups and monthly for 6 months for the CVR group and after 1, 3, and 6 months for the OC group. These cultures were streaked on specific media to provide quantitative aerobic and anaerobic, lactobacillus, Candida sp., Gardnerella vaginalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae counts in micro-organisms per milliliter. A comparison of the number and types of organisms isolated from vaginal cultures obtained initially and at 6 months demonstrated no statistically significant differences in colony counts between CVR and OC users. The results of this study suggest that the use of the CVR is not associated with a greater growth of pathogens than is oral administration of a progestin and estrogen combination.

AB  - In two general practices in Perth, Western Australia, the most common microbiological causes of vaginal discomfort in 368 patients were Candida albicans. Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and bacteroides fragilis. Amongst patients with abnormal vaginal odour, with or without vaginitis, the most common cause of odour was G. vaginalis. The writers advocate that heavy growths of group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and enterococci should be considered to be the possible cause of vaginal discomfort. This reinforces the need for care in collection, transportation, and microbiological examination of swabs of the female genital tract. as well as in the clinical interpretation of these reports.
TI  - Anaerobic and other fastidious microorganisms in asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women.
AB  - Urine from 44 pregnant women with known or suspected renal disease (group 1) and  from 50 healthy pregnant women (group 2) with negative routine cultures of midstream urine was obtained by suprapubic aspiration. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures showed bacteriuria in 70% of the women in group 1 and in 26% of those in group 2. Gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated organism. Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated from 14(48%) of 29 women in group 1 and from two (12.5%) of 16 women in group 2. Radiologic studies showed a high incidence of underlying renal disease in asymptomatic women with bacteriuria. Localization testing indicated kidney infection in six of 14 women in group 1 and in one of four women in group 2. These findings suggest that there is an increased susceptibility to colonization of the bladder with these microorganisms during pregnancy and that persistence of infection and renal involvement are associated with underlying renal disease.
TI  - Comparison of miconazole-coated tampons with clotrimazole vaginal tablets in the  treatment of vaginal candidosis.
AB  - The effectiveness and acceptability of miconazole-coated tampons were compared with those clotrimazole vaginal tablets in the treatment of vaginal candidosis in 100 women. Both treatments were highly effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of infection; 95% of the group treated with miconazole had negative culture results for Candida species immediately after treatment compared with 86% of those treated with clotrimazole. A 17.6% recurrence rate of positive culture results was found four weeks later in the miconazole-treated group compared with that of 30% in the clotrimazole-treated group. The miconazole tampons were highly acceptable to patients. Vaginal pH values did not differ significantly between those patients with candidosis and those treated and cured. Corynebacterium vaginale (Gardnerella vaginalis) vaginitis and nonspecific genital infection were common complicating factors during follow up.
TI  - Ureaplasma urealyticum in the upper urinary tracts of renal allograft recipients.
AB  - Urine samples from 123 renal transplant recipients were cultured for the presence of Ureaplasma urealyticum and other fastidious microorganisms. Ureaplasmas were recovered alone or in association with other microbial species from the bladder urine of 13 (11%) of the 123 patients, and evidence of involvement of the upper urinary tract was present in nine patients. Colonization of the upper urinary tract by U. urealyticum was not associated with a decline in function of the grafted kidney and was found only in patients with a primary diagnosis of reflux nephropathy (50% of such patients were positive for ureaplasmas) or glomerulonephritis (10% were positive) who had their own kidneys. The next most common isolate was Gardnerella vaginalis, recovered from 7% of patients, the majority of whom harbored the organism in the bladder only. The results confirm that U. urealyticum may colonize the upper urinary tracts of patients with proven renal disease.

Cure was confirmed by negative vaginal cultures 7 weeks after the start of therapy. Metronidazole proved to be effective in 20 of 22 couples (90.9%) treated.

TI  - Adherence of bacteria to vaginal epithelial cells at various times in the menstrual cycle.
AB  - Adherence of vaginal isolates of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus species, group B streptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells was studied in 10 healthy, sexually active medical students. Studies were done pre- and postmenstrually and at midcycle for two consecutive menstrual cycles. The mean number of adherent bacteria per vaginal epithelial cell (range) was 3.4 (0 to 14) for E. coli, 60.5 (12 to 152) for Lactobacillus species, 54.8 (21 to 76) for group B streptococci, 67.4 (15 to 161) for G. vaginalis, and 58.9 (15 to 186) diplococci for N. gonorrhoeae. Adherence of G. vaginalis increased with increasing acidity of the test medium (pH 4 to 8). There were no significant differences in adherence to vaginal epithelial cells obtained at the various times in the menstrual cycle for any of the organisms (p greater than 0.05). The pattern and extent of adherence among the women was similar for each organism. In this in vitro model, adherence characteristics did not vary with the menstrual cycle.

TI  - Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale, Gardnerella vaginalis) in a family planning clinic population.
AB  - Vaginal specimens were obtained at 902 attendances from 522 women requiring vaginal examination at a family planning clinic. Haemophilus vaginalis was found in 8% of specimens either by culture or by at least two out of three microscopical tests; lactobacilli were seldom found in the presence of the organism. Increased signs and symptoms, especially an offensive odour, were found only when H vaginalis and staphylococcus were isolated together. The organism was found less often in patients using contraceptives methods which protected the vagina, thus suggesting sexual transmission. Treatment is advisable when H vaginalis is in contact with a vascular bed.
TI  - Sexually transmitted conditions among women college students.
AB  - We studied 500 unselected young women who consulted a gynecologist in a student health service. Most participants were symptom-free and had normal physical examinations. Few sexually transmitted infections were encountered. Neisseria gonorrhoeae was recovered from two and Trichomonas vaginalis was obtained from 14 of 500 women. Chlamydia trachomatis was recovered from 20 (4.6%) of 439 participants. Genital warts, genital herpes, and molluscum contagiosum, respectively, were noted in seven, four, and one of the 500 participants. There was no cases of syphilis, scabies, or pediculosis pubis. Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum, respectively, were recovered from 17.6 and 56.8% of the subjects. Prevalent vaginal bacteria included lactobacilli, streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from the vaginal specimens of about one third of the participants.

TI  - Scanning electron microscopic examination of Bacteroides fragilis and Gardnerella vaginalis after exposure to concentration gradients of metronidazole and tinidazole.
AB  - Agar diffusion tests with metronidazole and tinidazole were performed with one strain each of Bacteroides fragilis and Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis, Corynebacterium vaginalis). Their cell morphology was studied 'in situ' on agar surfaces by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A sharp growth end-point was found for B. fragilis, whereas with G. vaginalis there was a gradual decrease in the number and size of the colonies close to the agar well. The SEM study also revealed elongation of the B. fragilis cells when exposed to high concentrations of either drug. No such elongation of G. vaginalis was observed.
TI  - Nonspecific vaginosis.
AB  - Nonspecific vaginosis (NSV) is a very common clinical syndrome with characteristic clinical, biochemical, and microbiologic features. There is a thin, malodorous homogeneous, grey, nonpurulent vaginal discharge. The discharge usually has a pH greater than 4.5, contains "clue cells" on wet mount examination, and produces a "fishy" odor when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide. The discharge contains an increased concentration of at least seven amines which are presumably produced by bacterial decarboxylases; and several volatile and non-volatile organic acid metabolites of anaerobic bacteria. Although the pathogenesis of NSV is not understood, the normal, lactobacillus-dominated microbial flora is replaced by Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis and certain anaerobic species. Treatment with sulfonamide creams or oral tetracycline is usually ineffective. Ampicillin is often effective, but metronidazole appears to be the most effective antimicrobial for this condition. The optimal dose of metronidazole, and the need for treatment of sex partners, require further study.

TI  - Relative susceptibilities of Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Bacteroides fragilis to Metronidazole and its two major metabolites.
AB  - The susceptibilities of strains of Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Bacteroides fragilis to metronidazole and its principal oxidative metabolites (1-[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-hydroxymethyl-5-nitroimidazole) ("hydroxy" metabolite) and 1-acetic acid-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole ("acid" metabolite), were compared by determinations of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these compounds. Against ten strains of G. vaginalis, the hydroxy metabolite was the most active (median MIC, 2 microgram/ml); the median MICs of metronidazole and of the acid metabolite were 8 and 64 microgram/ml, respectively. The hydroxy metabolite was also the most active against 15 strains of N. gonorrhoeae (median MIC, 32 microgram/ml). In contrast, metronidazole was the most active against ten strains of B. fragilis (median MIC, 1 microgram/ml); the hydroxy and acid metabolites had median MICs of 2 and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results indicate that in the treatment of G. vaginalis-associated vaginitis with metronidazole, the hydroxy metabolite may contribute a significant antimicrobial effect, in view of its excellent activity in vitro.
TI  - The origin and diagnosis of "nonspecific vaginitis".
AB  
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria in nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  - To study the cause of nonspecific vaginitis, we analyzed vaginal fluid from normal women and from 53 women with nonspecific vaginitis, using quantitative anaerobic cultures and gas-liquid chromatography for short-chained organic-acid metabolites of the microbial flora. In normal vaginal fluid, lactate was the predominant acid, and the predominant organisms were lactobacillus and streptococcus species (lactate producers). In nonspecific vaginitis, lactate was decreased, whereas succinate, acetate, butyrate, and propionate were increased, the predominant flora included Gardnerella (Haemophilus) vaginalis (acetate producer), and anaerobes, which included bacteroides species (succinate producers) and peptococcus species (butyrate and acetate producers). After metronidazole therapy, symptoms and signs of nonspecific vaginitis cleared, butyrate and propionate disappeared, and lactate and lactate-producing organisms became predominant. We conclude that certain anaerobes act with G. vaginalis as causes of nonspecific vaginitis, and that a high ratio of succinate to lactate in vaginal fluid is a useful indicator in the diagnosis of this condition.
TI  - Treatment of vaginitis.
AB  - The physiology and flora of the normal vagina and the more common causes and associated treatments of vaginitis are reviewed. Vaginitis encompasses a group of diseases causing inflammatory changes in the vagina and vulva. Treatment of the various vaginitides requires accurate diagnosis, which is hampered by difficulties in culturing pathogens and in resolving the pathogenicity of various organisms. The ability of the body to withstand vaginitis is affected by physiologic changes within the vagina. The vaginitides and associated treatments reviewed include candidiasis and trichomoniasis; Hemophilus vaginalis and other bacterial vaginitis; and Herpes hominis, chlamydial, and atropic vaginitis.
TI  - A taxonomic study of Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis) Gardner and Dukes 1955.
AB  - Fifty-five strains received as Haemophilus vaginalis or as catalase-negative coryneform bacteria from the vagina together with 61 marker cultures were subjected to numerical phenetic analyses using 149 unit characters. The data were examined using the simple matching (SSM), Jaccard (SJ) and pattern (DP) coefficients and clustering was achieved using the average linkage algorithm. Cluster composition was not markedly affected by the coefficient used or by test error, estimated at 6 . 5%. The H. vaginalis strains formed a tight cluster which was only distantly related to representatives of the genera arthrobacter, Cellulomonas, Corynebacterium sensu stricto, Erysipelothrix, Haemophilus, Kurthia, Lactobacillus, Listeria and Propionibacterium but shared a high overall affinity to unclassified catalase-negative coryneforms which formed a discrete taxon, cluster 9. The H. vaginalis strains could be distinguished from the related strains in cluster 9 by several unrelated phenotypic characters. Using the S1 endonuclease assay, DNA-DNA hybridizations were performed with representative strains from the numerical as well as with reference strains of Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces. Haemophilus vaginalis was found to be a genotypically legitimate group and its DNA showed little homology with DNA from the marker strains tested. The DNA base composition of H. vaginalis was 42 to 44 mol % guanine plus cytosine. A new genus should be created to incorporate strains known as H. vaginalis or Corynebacterium vaginale. The name Gardnerella vaginalis proposed by Greenwood & Pickett (1979) is supported.
TI  - Metronidazole in treatment against Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  - The rate of bactericidal activity and inactivation of metronidazole was studied in time-kill curves with Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of metronidazole for the eight strains tested ranged from 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. At a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml, metronidazole demonstrated a slow cidal effect against exponential-phase organisms, requiring 24 to 48 h for completion. Inactivation of metronidazole during the time-kill curve was quite variable and averaged 28% of the starting concentration after 48 h. Against stationary-phase organisms (inoculum, 10(10) to 10(11) colony-forming units per ml), a slow cidal effect was also seen, with an average inactivation of metronidazole of 38% after 48 h. At a subinhibitory concentration of 5 micrograms/ml, metronidazole was inactivated to the greatest degree (57% after 48 h). Therefore, in contrast to earlier studies in which metronidazole was rapidly and consistently cidal within 4 h against obligate anaerobes and was almost completely inactivated by 8 h, the bactericidal effect of metronidazole againsts H. vaginalis in this study was much slower and was associated with a variable and slower rate of inactivation.
TI  - Inhibition of some normal and pathogenic vaginal bacteria by oral and vaginal streptococci.
AB  - Hemolytic and nonhemolytic strains of Streptococcus faecalis, together with some  strains of oral and vaginal alpha-hemolytic streptococci, produced one or more factors that inhibited the growth of Gardnerella vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and a variety of other vaginal bacteria. Some streptococci were inhibitory to indicator organisms only in the presence of catalase, whereas catalase either enhanced or prevented inhibitory action for still other streptococci. The inhibitors produced by certain streptococci resembled enterococcal bacteriocins, which have not previously been found to inhibit G. vaginalis or N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Haemophilus vaginalis vaginitis after twenty-five years.
AB  - This paper provides an abbreviated review of developments related to Haemophilus  vaginalis vaginitis since its original description a quarter of a century ago. My intervening years of interest and research in the field of vulvovaginal infections have served to further confirm the originally published concepts regarding this highly prevalent, precisely defined, readily recognizable, and aesthetically objectionable vaginal disease. An occasional investigator still questions the pathogenicity of the causative short gram-negative bacillus. The only remaining major controversy, however, concerns the taxonomic position of the organism. The evidence is that it belongs neither to the genus Haemophilus nor to the genus Corynebacterium.

TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition of Haemophilus species, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus Actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  - The fatty acid composition of 35 Haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-OH-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. The three C18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. This general pattern was also found for most of the other species of Haemophilus examined (H. aegyptius, H. aphrophilus, H. canis, H. gallinarum, H. haemolyticus, and H. parainfluenzae). Small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for H. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species H. paraphrohaemolyticus, H. paraphrophilus and H. suis. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from H. influenzae. Pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely related to that of Haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the C18 fatty acids. The fatty acid pattern of H. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. This species lacked 3-OH-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.
TI  - Corynebacterium vaginale and vaginitis: a controlled trial of treatment.
AB  - In a study of the diagnosis and treatment of Corynebacterium vaginale (Haemophilus vaginalis) vaginitis in 30 patients, clinical and microscopical findings were compared with laboratory cultures. The study also included a double-blind randomised trial of treatment regimens including placebo therapy. Laboratory cultures of C. vaginale corresponded well with clinical findings, and we suggest that C. vaginale vaginitis can be reliably diagnosed with clinical and microscopical findings. Tetracycline was effective in half the patients treated, whereas all but 1 of the 17 patients eventually treated with metronidazole were cured. The apparent discrepancy between in-vitro sensitivity and in-vitro efficacy of metronidazole in this condition is discussed.
TI  - Hemophilus vaginalis bacteremia.
AB  - During 1975--77 Hemophilus vaginalis bacteremia occurred post partum in eight previously healthy women. Seven had been admitted for delivery at term and one because of threatened abortion. Six underwent cesarean section. Post-partum pyrexia and neutrophilia were the main features. All the patients recovered uneventfully while receiving antibiotics. H. vaginalis is an infrequent agent of bacteremia; it affects predominantly women after obstetric trauma.
TI  - Haemophilus vaginalis infection. Diagnosis and treatment.
AB  - Some 4,263 women from special, family planning and gynecologic clinics were screened at random for the presence of H. vaginalis (C. vaginale) infection. Twenty-four percent of the women from the special clinics, 6% from the family planning and 4% from the gynecology clinics were culture positive although microscopic findings were somewhat higher than this. Of 582 women attending special clinics who were infected solely with H. vaginalis, only 261 complained of having an offensive discharge. Two hundred thirty-eight women reported "no symptoms," but 116 of them did have an offensive discharge on examination. These 582 women were treated with either ampicillin, ampicillin with probenecid or sulphonamide vaginal tablets. All were largely effective. Direct microscopy was regarded as being a reliable guide to H. vaginalis infection.

TI  - Ineffectiveness of erythromycin for treatment of Haemophilus vaginalis-associated vaginitis: possible relationship to acidity of vaginal secretions.
AB  - To assess the efficacy of oral erythromycin in the treatment of nonspecific vaginitis (NSV), conducted a nonrandom, unblinded pilot study among 17 women with symptoms and signs of NSV. At the completion of treatment, 10 of 13 patients had persistent symptoms, 9 of 13 had persistent abnormal discharge, and 11 of 13 had persistently positive cultures for Haemophilus vaginalis. Ten patients with persistent or relapsing NSV and four who did not complete erythromycin treatment were retreated with oral metronidazole, and 14 of 14 showed clinical improvement and eradication of H. vaginalis. The susceptibility of 27 clinical isolates of H. vaginalis to erythromycin was determined at pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0. The minimal inhibitory concentration of erythromycin for H. vaginalis was approximately 10-fold higher at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.0. Erythromycin is not effective for the treatment of H. vaginalis-associated NSV; this may be partly attributable to the reduced activity of this drug in acidic vaginal secretions.

TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale) to  21 antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 56 strains of Haemophilus vaginalis were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents by an agar dilution method. All strains were inhibited by 1 mug or less of penicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, and vancomycin per ml. The cephalosporins were less active; 4 mug of cefazolin per ml, 16 mug of cephalothin per ml, or 128 mug of cephalexin per ml was required to inhibit all strains. Kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and neomycin were relatively inactive against H. vaginalis. All strains were inhibited by 4 mug of streptomycin per ml and 2 mug of chloramphenicol per ml. Only 57% of the strains were inhibited by 4 mug of tetracycline per ml, whereas 43% were inhibited by 16 to 64 mug/ml. The combination sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was relatively inactive against H. vaginalis. All strains tested exhibited minimal inhibitory concentrations of >/=128 mug when tested against colistin, nalidixic acid, and sulfadiazine. Erythromycin and clindamycin were the most active of the antibiotics tested; for all strains the minimal inhibitory concentrations were </=0.06 mug/ml.

TI  - Inhibition of Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale) by metronidazole,  tetracycline, and ampicillin.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ampicillin, tetracycline, and metronidazole for 71 strains of Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale) were compared by use of an agar-dilution method and an inoculum of 10(6) organisms/ml. All strains were sensitive to 1 microgram of ampicillin/ml, 70% to 4 micrograms of tetracycline/ml, and only 13% of the strains to 8 micrograms of metronidazole/ml. Under anaerobic conditions the susceptibility to metronidazole increased markedly, and 48% of the strains were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. In determinations of MICs in broth cultures, reduction of the inoculum size to 10(4) organisms/ml increased susceptibilities to metronidazole and tetracycline, whereas incubation of 48 hr instead of 24 hr decreased susceptibilities to these two drugs. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were generally two- to fourfold greater than the MICs for the three drugs. The results demonstrate that anaerobic conditions, inoculum size, and duration of incubation influence the susceptibility of H. vaginalis to antibiotics in vitro.

AB  - A total of 78 strains of Haemophilus vaginalis were examined for 104 features. All strains fermented dextrin, maltose, and starch. Additionally, more than 90% of the strains fermented galactose, glucose, and ribose. Arbutin, cellobiose, melibiose, rhamnose, and salicin were not fermented by any of these strains. None of the strains acidified any of 14 alcohols or alkalinized any of 25 organic salts and amides. More than 90% of the strains hemolyzed human blood agar and hydrolyzed hippurate. No strain hemolyzed sheep blood agar. A recommendation is included for those minimal features that best differentiate H. vaginalis from other oxidase- and catalase-negative, gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Factors affecting isolation and identification of Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  - The rate of isolation of organisms resembling Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale) from vaginal specimens was not significantly affected by anaerobic versus carbon dioxide incubation atmospheres or whether specimens were inoculated on isolation media immediately after collection or after a delay of 6 h. Forty-one clinically isolated strains were provisionally divided into 30 H. vaginalis strains and 11 H. vaginalis-like (HVL) strains based on morphological and growth characteristics. The H. vaginalis strains were less reactive in API-20A identification test strips, (Analytab Products, Inc.) using Lombard-Dowell broth, than in a modified basal medium that contained proteose peptone no. 3 (Difco). The numbers and kinds of substrates fermented by 30 clinical and 2 reference strains of H. vaginalis varied among conventional, API, Minitek (Baltimore Biological Laboratory), and rapid buffered substrate fermentation systems. A greater number and variety of carbohydrates were fermented by the 11 HVL strains more consistently in all four test systems. Analysis of volatile and nonvolatile fermentation end products by gas-liquid chromatography did not reveal significant differences between the H. vaginalis and HVL strains. However, the latter group grew in peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth, whereas the H. vaginalis strains did not grow without the addition of starch to peptone-yeast extract-glucose. All of the reference and clinical strains were similar in their susceptibilities to a variety of antimicrobial compounds except sulfonamides, which inhibited the HVL strains and bifidobacteria but not the H. vaginalis strains. Sulfonamide susceptibility or resistance corresponded in part to the H. vaginalis and HVL-bifidobacteria strain reactions on selected conventional fermentation substrates. Susceptibility or resistance to sulfonamides and metronidazole in conjunction with fermentation tests is described to aid in the separation of H. vaginalis from other possibly unrecognized biotypes of H. vaginalis or other vaginal bacteria that presumptively resemble the organism. A human blood medium known as V agar was also of considerable value in distinguishing H. vaginalis from HVL strains, because only the H. vaginalis strains produced diffuse beta-hemolysis on V agar.

TI  - Nonspecific vaginitis: role of Haemophilus vaginalis and treatment with metronidazole.
AB  - To assess the cause of nonspecific vaginitis, we performed a prospective case-control study of vaginal flora and a randomized unblinded trial of different therapies. Haemophilus vaginalis was isolated from 17 to 18 women with signs of vaginitis but only one of 18 normal matched controls (P less than 0.002). The concentration of anaerobic bacteria in vaginal washings also was increased in patients. Clinical improvement and eradication of H. vaginalis occurred in one of seven patients given sulfonamide vaginal cream, two of 15 given oral doxycycline, nine of 27 given oral ampicillin, and 80 of 81 given oral metronidazole. On the seventh day of therapy signs of nonspecific vaginitis persisted in 31 of 31 with, and in two of 92 without, persistent H. vaginalis infection (P less than 0.001). These data suggest the causal role of H. vaginalis in nonspecific vaginitis, possibly in concert with vaginal anaerobes. The widespread use of sulfonamide creams is inappropriate. Metronidazole is effective, but its efficacy must be weighed against its possible toxicity.

TI  - Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale) vaginitis in women attending public health clinics: response to treatment with ampicillin.
AB  - Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale) was isolated from genital specimens from 150 women who came to a public health venereal disease clinic. Forty-six patients returned to the clinic for at least one follow-up examination. Of the returnees, 22 of 24 who initially had received adequate therapy (14 g ampicillin in seven days) were cured, compared with three of 22 who did not received adequate therapy (X2 = 25.11; P less than 0.00005). These data included significant cure rates with adequate therapy among the 46 returnees, of whom 25 had vaginitis due to H. vaginalis only (X2 = 16.67; P less than 0.00005) and 21 had vaginitis caused by a mixture of pathogens (X2 = 5.86; P less than 0.0156). Specimens obtained from 24 of the 46 returnees were cultured for H. vaginalis on the second visit; 19 were negative, and only five were positive. Clinical responses of the patients correlated closely with the results of culture in both treated and untreated groups (X2 = 14.23; P less than 0.00016).
TI  - Vaginal colonization with Corynebacterium vaginale (Haemophilus vaginalis).
AB  - Vaginal cultures for Corynebacterium vaginale and confidential questionnaires were obtained from unselected young women who consulted a gynecologist in a student health service. In all, 466 women were studied, 150 (32.2%) of whom were colonized with C. vaginale. Logit analysis defined four factors that were significantly associated with colonization with C. vaginale: nonwhite race, use of oral contraceptives, no history of marriage, and a history of pregnancy. Sexual experience had little influence on colonization; C. vaginale was isolated from 16 (29%) of 56 sexually inexperienced women and from 40 (41%) of 98 women who had had intercourse with six or more men. After a few patients with trichomoniasis were excluded, there was no association between colonization with C. vaginale and an abnormal vaginal discharge, either as reported by the participant or as noted by the examining physician.

TI  - Etiology of nongonococcal urethritis. Evidence for Chlamydia trachomatis and Ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum (T-mycoplasma), and Hemophilus vaginalis have previously been considered possible etiological agents in nongonococcal urethritis (NGU). In this study, current C. trachomatis infection was confirmed by culture and (or) micro-immunofluorescence serology in 26 of 69 men experiencing afirst episode of NGU, and 1 of 39 with no urethritis. Serum IgM immunofluorescent antibody to chlamydia was demonstrated in 16 of 20 men with chlamydia culture positive NGU, and 3 of 39 with chlamydia culture negative NG, and none of 34 with no urethritis. 9 of 10 culture positive men with less than or equal to 10 days symptoms developed immunofluorescent antibody seroconversion in paired sera. U. realyticum was isolated significantly more often and in significantly higher concentration from first voided urine from chlamydia-negative cases of NGU than from chlamydia-positive NGU. Ureaplasmacidal antibody titers increased fourfold in six men, four of whom had negative cultures for for unreaplasma. H. vaginalis was isolated from c9 of 33 men with no urethritis and 2 of 69 with NGU. C. trachomatis is susceptible, and U. urealyticum is resistant to sulfonamides. A 10-day course of sulfisoxazole therapy produced improvement in 13 of 13 chlamydia-positive, unreaplasma-negative, and only 14 of 29 chlamydia-negative, unreaplasma-positive NGU cases (P less than 0.002). Thus, culture, serology, and response to therapy support the etiologic role of chlamydia in NGU. Quantitative culture and response to therapy suggest U. unrealyticum may cause many cases of chlamydia-netative NGU.
TI  - Corynebacterium vaginale.
AB  - Corynebacterium vaginale is a sexually transmitted organism which was first recognized in 1953. It appears to utilize glycogen stored in vaginal epithelial cells, causing a malodorous vaginal discharge characterized by an abnormally high pH (5.0 to 5.5) and composed mainly of epithelial cells and hordes of bacilli. Infected men are asymptomatic, carry the organism for an unknown period of time, and transmit it through intercourse. The organism requires five B-vitamins, purines, pyrimidines, and a fermentable carbohydrate; neither factors X nor V are required. It is not a member of genus Haemophilus and is not likely to be a Corynebacterium. Appearing mainly Gram-negative, it has many characteristics of Gram-positive organisms including its pattern of sensitivity to antibiotics and the possession of certain enzyme systems. As the cause of bacterial vaginitis, C. vaginale may be the most prevalent sexually-transmitted organism.

TI  - Tellurite reduction test to aid in the recognition of Corynebacterium vaginale.
AB  - Corynebacterium vaginale (Haemophilus vaginalis) does not reduce potassium tellurite. When a 1% aqueous solution of tellurite is added to starch agar plates previously inoculated with vaginal discharge material, other starch-fermenting and most non-starch-fermenting bacteria rapidly reduce tellurite to produce black or gray colonies. This test is a useful adjunct to methods for rapid presumptive identification of C. vaginale. C. vaginale is more susceptible to tellurite inhibition than a variety of other gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Comparisons between direct microscopic and cultural methods for recognition of Corynebacterium vaginale in women with vaginitis.
AB  - The frequency with which clue cells could be detected in Gram-stained vaginal smears and/or cervical Papanicolaou (Pap) smears was compared with the frequency of Corynebacterium vaginale (Haemophilus vaginalis) isolation in a group of 236 female patients, of whom 221 had vaginitis. Vaginal clue cells were found most often in women from whom C. vaginale was isolated (P = 0.00006) whereas, conversely, clue cells in cervical Pap smears were reported more frequently in women with negative cultures for this organism (P = 0.006). C. vaginale isolations were made more frequently from women with both vaginal and cervical clue cells reported (P = 0.000088). However, the combined false positive-false negative vaginal clue cell rate in the patients studied was 36.5%. Neither the detection of vaginal clue cells nor the isolation of C. vaginale was significantly affected by whether or not patients had trichomoniasis (P = 0.25). Trichomonas vaginalis detection in cervical Pap smears and vaginal isolation were related (P = 0.00005), whereas the same relationship was not significant for fungi (P = greater than 0.05).

Fifty-one percent were taking an oral contraceptive drug, as compared to 36% of 140 women in a control group. Various sexually transmitted diseases were diagnosed either concomitantly or at another time in 52% of women in the study group and 38% of those in the control group. The rate of cervical neoplasia (invasive carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, and dysplasia) was 13.6% in the study group and 5.7% in the control group, the rate in the study group being several times that in the general population. These and other available epidemiologic data support the conclusion that C vainale is transmitted sexually.
TI  - Corynebacterium vaginale (Hemophilus vaginalis) bacteremia: clinical study of 29  cases.
AB  - Twenty-nine patients with bacteremia due to Corynebacterium vaginale, an inhabitant of the female genital tract, are described. Four were newborn babies. Nineteen were healthy young women delivered at full term by an operative procedure, cesarean section, or episiotomy. Within 48 hours fever and bacteremia developed. While receiving antibiotics the fever returned to normal, usually within 48 hours. The remaining cases were associated with septic abortion, tubal pregnancy, an intrauterine device, hydatidiform mole, and cellulitis. None of the adults showed evidence of brain abscess, meningitis, or endocarditis. Corynebacterium vaginale is an opportunistic minor pathogen that apparently gains access to the blood stream via an exposed vascular bed rather than as the result of immunosupression.

TI  - Importance of the so-called 'other' sexually-transmitted diseases.
AB  - (1) Some data are presented concerning the frequency and potential morbidity of sexually-transmitted organisms other than T. pallidum or N. gonorrhoeae. (2) Most of the diseases with which these organisms are associated are more prevalent than syphilis and some, at least in one sex, are as common as gonorrhoea. A number appear to carry considerable morbidity, which in the case of Type II herpes virus--if it is responsible for cervical cancer--may ultimately cause more fatalities than syphilis. (3) It is concluded: (a) that, if syphilis and gonorrhoea were reduced to the point of representing no public health concern, many other sexually-transmitted conditions would still remain to pose significant problems: and (b) that health education and other methods of prevention should, where possible, be designed to take into consideration the epidemiological implications of the other organisms listed.

TI  - The role of fomites in the transmission of vaginitis.
AB  - A role for fomites such as toilet seats in the transmission of vaginitis has never been proved or disproved. A compilation of clinical data from a university community showed that the organisms found in vaginal cultures of patients with vaginitis were, in order of frequency. Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Hemophilus vaginalis and Trichomonas vaginalis. In a concurrent bacteriologic survey of washroom fixtures, staphylococci and other micrococci were isolated most frequently. The overt pathogens associated with vaginitis were never found, and gram-negative organisms appeared to be suppressed by the disinfectant used by the cleaning staff. It is clear that fomites are not an important mode of transmission in vaginitis, although a search for specific pathogens on toilets is to be continued.

TI  - Sensitivity of Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale) to oleandomycin and spectinomycin.
AB  - Haemophilus vaginalis is highly sensitive to oleandomycin. The MIC ranged from 0.035 to 0.15 mug/ml. The sensitivity of H. vaginalis to spectinomycin was 2.5-5.0 mug/ml. The sensitivity of H. vaginalis to spectinomycin is 3-4 times higher than that of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A favourable effect in the treatment of vaginitis caused by H. vaginalis could thus be expected.
