isothiocyanates in myrosinase treated herb extract of cleome chrysantha decne. and their antimicrobial activities.
gc/ms analysis of the volatiles produced by the action of endogenous myrosinase in cleome chrysantha decne. herb, showed three major components, 1-isocyano-4-methyl benzene, gamma-muurolene and (cis) nerolidole (21.72%, 12.15% and 10.39%, respectively). 1-isocyano-4-methyl benzene is not produced from myrosinase treated seeds of cleome chrysantha decne., while muurolene and nerolidole were found at higher concentrations 16.1% and 13.67%, respectively. some other isothiocyanates identified in the seeds and leaves, but in low percentages, were 2-methylbutyl isothiocyanate, 4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate and isothiocyanatomethyl benzene. enzymatic hydrolysis of the ethanol extract of cleome chrysantha decne., produced two non-volatile isothiocyanates, 4, 6-dimethyltetrahydro-1,3-oxazine-2-thione and n-(-4-methyl-sulphinyl-3-butenyl) isothiocyanate which was established by aniline and methanolic ammonia to give the stable form of phenyl thiourea. they were identified by their spectroscopic data. these two isothiocyanates and the volatiles of the herb showed good antimicrobial activity against e. coli, pseudomonas putida and rhizobium meloloti (gram-negative bacteria) and moderate activity against bacillus subtilis and streptococcus lactis (gram-positive bacteria).
[ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
the survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and p. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. after inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. during a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. after that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (cfu)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g activated carbon. klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. if the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, p. putida and p. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) cfu/ml. e. coli was suppressed by p. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of p. putida. as in-vitro tests indicated, p. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against p. aeruginosa or e. coli. on the other hand, p. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against e. coli.
survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
the survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (ac) filters on a bench scale was investigated. the results revealed that after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized ac absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). after a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) cfu/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) cfu/g of ac. when klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. the numbers of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida, however, decreased immediately and showed no regrowth in nonsterile ac from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). these bacteria reduced e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and p. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. the hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. competition for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.
