TI  == a novel microbial source tracking microarray for pathogen detection and fecal source identification in environmental systems.
AB  == pathogen detection and the identification of fecal contamination sources are challenging in environmental waters. factors including pathogen diversity and ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria hamper risk assessment and remediation of contamination sources. a custom microarray targeting pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa), microbial source tracking (mst) markers, and antibiotic resistance genes was tested against dna obtained from whole genome amplification  (wga) of rna and dna from sewage and animal (avian, cattle, poultry, and swine) feces. perfect and mismatch probes established the specificity of the microarray  in sewage, and fluorescence decrease of positive probes over a 1:10 dilution series demonstrated semiquantitative measurement. pathogens, including norovirus, campylobacter fetus, helicobacter pylori, salmonella enterica, and giardia lamblia were detected in sewage, as well as mst markers and resistance genes to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and tetracycline. sensitivity (percentage true positives) of mst results in sewage and animal waste samples (21-33%) was lower than specificity (83-90%, percentage of true negatives). next generation dna sequencing revealed two dominant bacterial families that were common to all sample types: ruminococcaceae and lachnospiraceae. five dominant phyla and 15 dominant families comprised 97% and 74%, respectively, of sequences from all fecal sources. phyla and families not represented on the microarray are possible  candidates for inclusion in subsequent array designs.

TI  == influence of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis infection on the composition of chicken cecal microbiota.
AB  == background: infection of newly hatched chicks with salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (s. enteritidis) results in an inflammatory response in the intestinal tract which may influence the composition of gut microbiota. in this study we were therefore interested whether s. enteritidis induced inflammation results in changes in the cecal microbiota. to reach this aim, we compared the cecal microbiota of non-infected chickens and those infected by s. enteritidis by pyrosequencing the v3/v4 variable regions of genes coding for 16s rrna. results:  cecal microbiota of chickens up to 19 days of life was dominated by representatives of enterobacteriaceae, lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, followed by lactobacillaceae. the presence of lachnospiraceae did not change after s. enteritidis infection. enterobacteriaceae increased and ruminococcaceae  decreased after s. enteritidis infection in two independent experiments although  these results were not significant. a significant increase in both experiments was observed only for the representatives of lactobacillaceae which may correlate with their microaerophilic growth characteristic compared to the obligate anaerobes from the families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae. conclusions: we  conclude that s. enteritidis infection influences the composition of the cecal microbiota in chickens but these changes are minor in nature and should be understood more as an indirect consequence of infection and inflammation rather than a positively selected evolutionary trait.

TI  == profiling the gastrointestinal microbiota in response to salmonella: low versus high salmonella shedding in the natural porcine host.
AB  == controlling salmonella in the food chain is complicated by the ability of salmonella to colonize livestock without causing clinical symptoms/disease. salmonella-carrier animals are a significant reservoir for contamination of naive animals, the environment, and our food supply. salmonella carriage and shedding in pigs varies greatly both experimentally and on-farm. to investigate the dynamics between the porcine intestinal microbiota and salmonella shedding, we temporally profiled the microbiota of pigs retrospectively classified as low and  high salmonella-shedders. fifty-four piglets were collectively housed, fed and challenged with 10(9)salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. bacterial quantitation of salmonella in swine feces was determined, and total fecal dna was isolated for 16s rrna gene sequencing from groups of high-shedder, low-shedder, and non-inoculated pigs (n=5/group; 15 pigs total). analyses of bacterial community structures revealed significant differences between the microbiota of high-shedder and low-shedder pigs before inoculation and at 2 and 7 days post-inoculation (d.p.i.); microbiota differences were not detected between low-shedder and non-inoculated pigs. because the microbiota composition prior to  salmonella challenge may influence future shedding status, the "will-be" high and low shedder phylotypes were compared, revealing higher abundance of the ruminococcaceae family in the "will-be" low shedders. at 2d.p.i., a significant difference in evenness for the high shedder microbiota compared to the other two  groups was driven by decreases in prevotella abundance and increases in various genera (e.g. catenibacterium, xylanibacter). by 21 d.p.i., the microbial communities of high-shedder and low-shedder pigs were no longer significantly different from one another, but were both significantly different from non-inoculated pigs, suggesting a similar salmonella-induced alteration in maturation of the swine intestinal microbiota regardless of shedding status. our  results correlate microbial shifts with salmonella shedding status in pigs, further defining the complex interactions among the host, pathogen, and microbiota of this important public health issue and food safety concern.
