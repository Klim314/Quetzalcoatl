TI  == heat shock proteins in the human periodontal disease process.
AB  == the production of hsp by periodontopathic gram-negative bacteria was examined by  sds-page, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, and western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against hsps. strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, and treponema socranskii species produced hsp which reacted with anti-yersinia enterocolitica hsp 60 and/or mycobacterial 65-kda hsp monoclonal antibodies. it found that gingival homogenate samples from patients with adult periodontitis reacted with anti-human hsp were also found in a serum sample from a periodontitis patient. the present study suggests that hsps are implicated in human periodontal disease  process.

TI  == comparative susceptibility of yersinia enterocolitica, eikenella corrodens, and penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam and alternative antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined for 14 strains of yersinia enterocolitica, 28 strains of eikenella corrodens, 10 strains of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and 10 strains of penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae. y. enterocolitica was found to be susceptible to the aminoglycosides tested and to chloramphenicol, moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime but resistant to ampicillin and variably susceptible to carbenicillin, cefoxitin, and cefazolin. on a weight basis, cefotaxime and moxalactam were the most active agents against e. corrodens. most strains of e. corrodens were resistant to the aminoglycosides tested: gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin. penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae was most susceptible  to cefotaxime and moxalactam. cefotaxime was consistently active against all tested strains of y. enterocolitica, e. corrodens, and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, three unusual but clinically significant pathogens.
