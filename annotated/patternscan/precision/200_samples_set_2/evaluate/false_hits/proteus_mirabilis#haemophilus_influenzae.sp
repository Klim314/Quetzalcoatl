TI  == [susceptibility of clinical isolates from primary care clinics to oral antibacterial agents].
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates from specimens of patients  in primary care clinics in 2005 was investigated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations of oral antibacterial agents. the numbers of test strains were 550 for gram-positive aerobes, 700 for gram-negative aerobes, and 150 for anaerobes. cefcapene (cfpn), cefditoren (cdtr), and cefteram (cftm) showed the most potent activities against staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. among the cephems tested and moxifloxacin (mflx) and tosufloxacin among the  new quinolones. although the new quinolones generally showed potent activities against these species, resistant strains were frequently detected in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. in addition, 70% or more of streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were intermediate or resistant to macrolides. cephems showed good activities against aerobic gram-negative bacteria except for  proteus spp. specifically, cfpn, cdtr, and cftm showed the most potent activity against haemophilus influenzae among the cephems tested. the new quinolones showed potent activities against gram-negative bacteria, especially h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, but not against proteus mirabilis and providencia spp. when compared with the susceptibilities of clinical isolates from tertiary care hospitals, found in other research, differences were noted, for example, there was a lower frequency of quinolone-resistant strains of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus but a higher frequency of macrolide-resistant strains of streptococcus  pyogenes. therefore, to accurately grasp susceptibility trends, well-focused surveillance studies are necessary.

TI  == in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ly163892.
AB  == ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics  of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm,  vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability  similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
