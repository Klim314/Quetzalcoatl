TI  == molecular diversity of bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) from nujiang  region, china.
AB  == the rumen content of four yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 otu (operational taxonomy unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. similarity analysis revealed that yunnan yellow cattle had 12 sequences (10 otu) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succiniclasticum ruminis, ruminococcus bromii, clostridium proteoclasticum, ruminococcus flavefaciens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total otu). the further 12 sequences (9 otu) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, schwartzia succinivorans, prevotella ruminicola, eubacterium ruminantium, ruminococcus albus, and clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of  the total otu). the remaining 105 sequences (90 otu) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total otu). according to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low g+c subdivision (accounting for  72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively) and cfb subdivision (cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively). among the examined clones, rare bacteria jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == dietary resistant and butyrylated starches have different effects on the faecal bacterial flora of azoxymethane-treated rats.
AB  == epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary fibre lowers the risk of colorectal cancer, which may be due to increased butyrate production from colonic fermentation of a type of fibre, resistant starch (rs). the present study investigated the effects of dietary rs and butyrylated rs on the faecal microbiota of rats treated with azoxymethane. a total of four groups of nine rats were fed diets containing either standard maize starch (low-amylose maize starch  (lams), low rs), lams with 3 % tributyrin (lamst), cooked 10 % high-amylose maize starch (hams, high rs) or cooked 10 % butyrylated hams (hamsb). faecal samples were examined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of pcr-amplified  16s rrna gene fragments. multivariate analysis demonstrated no differences between faecal microbiota before treatment but revealed differences in dgge patterns between diet groups, with the exception of the two low-rs groups (lams and lamst). subsequent analysis identified eleven dgge bands contributing significantly to the differentiation between diets. these phylotypes belonged to  clostridiales (five), lactobacillus (one) and bacteroidetes (five) lineages. rats fed hams had increased concentration of propionate in their distal colonic digesta and developed faecal populations containing ruminococcus bromii-like bacteria. hamsb increased propionate and butyrate concentrations in distal colonic digesta and was associated with the appearance of two non-butyrate-producing bacteria, lactobacillus gasseri and parabacteroides distasonis. in conclusion, supplementation with specific dietary rs leads to changes in faecal microbiota profiles that may be associated with improved bowel  health.
