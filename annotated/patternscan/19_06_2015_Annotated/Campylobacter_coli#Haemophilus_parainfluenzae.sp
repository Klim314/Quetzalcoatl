TI  == [basic and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the pediatric field].
AB  == pharmacokinetic , bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (nflx), a quinolone-carboxylic acid antibacterial agent, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. serum concentrations and urinary excretion of nflx after single dose of 2.2 approximately 5.6 mg/kg (mean 4.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg) were determined in 13 children with ages between 6 and 11 years. the mean peak serum concentration of the drug was 0.37 +/- 0.20 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after administration. the mean half-life of the drug in serum was 2.8 +/- 0.4 hours and the serum concentration at 8 hours was 0.11 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml. the mean urinary concentration reached a maximum of 125.2 +2- 166.2 micrograms/ml in pooled urine  from 0 to 2 hours and the mean urinary recovery rate in the first 8 hours after administration was 22.1 +/- 6.0%. a dose-response relationship was observed between doses/body weight and peak serum concentrations. 2. the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and the safety of nflx were evaluated in 65 pediatric patients with ages between 2 years 10 months and 15 years 7 months with infections. in 62 assessable cases (acute purulent tonsillitis 9 cases, acute pneumonia 3 cases, chronic rhinitis 1 case, urinary tract infections 15 cases, and acute colitis 34 cases), clinical efficacies were excellent in 48 cases, good in 13 cases, and fair in 1 case with an overall efficacy rate of 98.4%. staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, escherichia  coli 10 strains, salmonella sp. 5 strains, morganella morganii 1 strain, pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 strains, haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain and campylobacter jejuni 12 strains were isolated from the patients as pathogens. bacteriologically, all of these strains were eradicated except that 3 strains of  c. jejuni only decreased. with regard to side effects, dizziness and nausea were  observed in 1 case each but they were slight and the continuation of the treatment was possible. no abnormal laboratory test data were observed. from the  above results, nflx was considered to be a useful drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of pd 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  == the in vitro activity of pd 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) cfu  per spot). the activity of pd 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. pd 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., acinetobacter spp., serratia marcescens, and  branhamella catarrhalis (mics for 90% of the isolates [mic90s], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 (mic90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and pseudomonas spp. pd  117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, legionella pneumophila, and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). pd 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups a, b, c, and g, s. pneumoniae, and enterococci (mic90s, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). against staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, pd 117,596 (mic90s, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against corynebacterium spp. pd 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to  date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
