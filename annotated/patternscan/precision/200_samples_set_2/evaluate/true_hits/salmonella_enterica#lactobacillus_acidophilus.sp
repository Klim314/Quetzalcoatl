TI  == antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus la10 against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis se86 in mice.
AB  == salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis is one of the main pathogens responsible  for foodborne illness in brazil. probiotic bacteria can play a role in defense and recovery from enteropathogenic infections. in this study, the ability of lactobacillus acidophilus la10 to colonise and exert antagonistic effects in the  gastrointestinal tract was tested before and during experimental infection in conventional mice contaminated with s. enteritidis (se86). a dose of 0.1 ml containing 10(8) viable cells of se86 and l. acidophilus la10 was orally administered by gavage to mice. the experiment was divided into groups. as a negative control, group 1 was administered only sterile saline solution. as a positive control, group 2 was administered only se86. group 3 was first administered se86, and after 10 days, treated with l. acidophilus la10. group 4 was first administered l. acidophilus la10, and after 10 days, challenged with se86. the results demonstrated that a significant number of se86 cells were able  to colonize the gastrointestinal tract of mice, specifically in the colon and ileum. l. acidophilus la10 demonstrated an antagonistic effect against se86, with better results observed for group 3 over group 4. thus, l. acidophilus la10 shows potential antagonistic effects against s. enteritidis se86, especially if administered after infection.

TI  == d-fagomine lowers postprandial blood glucose and modulates bacterial adhesion.
AB  == d-fagomine is an iminosugar originally isolated from seeds of buckwheat (fagopyrum sculentum moench), present in the human diet and now available as a pure crystalline product. we tested d-fagomine for activities connected to a reduction in the risk of developing insulin resistance, becoming overweight and suffering from an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the activities were: intestinal sucrase inhibition in vitro (rat mucosa and everted intestine sleeves), modulation of postprandial blood glucose in rats, bacterial agglutination and bacterial adhesion to pig intestinal mucosa. when ingested together with sucrose or starch, d-fagomine lowered blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner without stimulating insulin secretion. d-fagomine reduced the area under the curve (0-120 min) by 20 % (p < 0.01) and shifted the time to maximum blood glucose concentration (tmax) by 15 min at doses of 1-2 mg/kg body weight when administered together with 1 g sucrose/kg body weight. moreover, d-fagomine (0.14 mm) agglutinated 60 % of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) populations (p < 0.01), while it did not show this effect on bifidobacterium spp. or lactobacillus spp. at the same concentration, d-fagomine significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the adhesion of enterobacteriaceae (95-99 % cells in the supernatant) and promoted the adhesion of lactobacillus acidophilus (56 % cells in the supernatant) to intestinal mucosa. d-fagomine did not show any effect on bacterial cell viability. based on  all this evidence, d-fagomine may be used as a dietary ingredient or functional food component to reduce the health risks associated with an excessive intake of  fast-digestible carbohydrates, or an excess of potentially pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.
AB  == six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion  of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the  antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.

TI  == antagonistic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus lb against intracellular salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infecting human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc-7 cells.
AB  == to gain further insight into the mechanism by which lactobacilli develop antimicrobial activity, we have examined how lactobacillus acidophilus lb inhibits the promoted cellular injuries and intracellular lifestyle of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 infecting the cultured, fully differentiated  human intestinal cell line caco-2/tc-7. we showed that the spent culture supernatant of strain lb (lb-scs) decreases the number of apical serovar typhimurium-induced f-actin rearrangements in infected cells. lb-scs treatment efficiently decreased transcellular passage of s. enterica serovar typhimurium. moreover, lb-scs treatment inhibited intracellular growth of serovar typhimurium, since treated intracellular bacteria displayed a small, rounded morphology resembling that of resting bacteria. we also showed that lb-scs treatment inhibits adhesion-dependent serovar typhimurium-induced interleukin-8 production.
