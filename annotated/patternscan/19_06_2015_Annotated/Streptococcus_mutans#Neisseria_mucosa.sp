TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == possible variation of the human oral bacterial community after wearing removable  partial dentures by dgge.
AB  == although it is well-known that variations of the microbial community in a specific location of human body may be associated with some diseases, the developing change of the oral microbiota related to oral diseases before and after wearing the removable partial dentures (rpd) is not completely understood.  in this study, three kinds of samples (saliva, supra- and subgingival plaque, and oral mucosal surfaces) were collected from the 10-patients group at three different times: before, 1-month and 6-months after the treatment. ten healthy adults were also selected as the control group. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was applied to identify the bacterial profiles and to analyze the dynamics of the oral microbial population in the pre- and post-therapy. the anova of repeated measurement data indicated that, in the saliva and mucosal surfaces,  wearing rpds caused significant change of numbers of amplicons. as many as 607 amplicons were chosen to cut out and re-amplify by pcr. after cloning and sequencing, a total of 16 bacterial genera were identified. the health-associated genera such as streptococcus, neisseria, rothia, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, gemella, veillonella, selenomona and actinomyces tended to decrease, whereas the  disease-associated species including streptococcus mutans tended to increase. in  general, wearing rpds influenced the diversity of the bacterial species in the oral microbial ecosystem. it is noteworthy that the oral environment will be changed from the healthy status towards the disease status after the treatment.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a taqman-based real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using taqman pcr and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. material and methods: fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by taqman pcr. results: the quantity of the cariogenic bacteria actinomyces spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacilllus spp., rothia dentocariosa, parvimonas micra, propionibacterium acnes and neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. no significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria  except p. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. conclusion: all the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.

TI  == amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial dna for real-time quantitative  pcr analysis.
AB  == background: high-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including pcr, dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial dna. in clinical settings, the amount of sampled dna is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular dna sequence types. methods: a linear amplification  protocol using dna polymerase i was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial dna. the protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate pcr of 16s rdna sequences. real-time quantitative pcr of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified dna against unamplified dna. results: the amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug dna from as little as 12.5 ng of template dna. correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative pcr results from amplified and unamplified dna were between 0.78 and 0.98. conclusion: the optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial dna from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == the growth of bacteria and the production of exoglycosidic enzymes in the dental  plaque of macaque monkeys.
AB  == the rate of growth of the predominant bacterial strains of plaque from the developmental grooves of first deciduous molar teeth was determined. median doubling times were 3.32, 3.45, 2.88 and 4.54 h for streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and neisseria mucosa respectively. withdrawal of dietary food did not greatly influence the number of bacteria found in the grooves 18 h after they had been cleaned when compared to the number in fed monkeys; exceptions were significant increases in streptococcus mitior and n. mucosa. addition of 0.5 per  cent (w/v) glucose to the drinking water of fasted monkeys also did not influence the size of this bacterial population 18 h after cleaning, so bacteria growing in cleaned grooves must gain a major part of their nutritional needs from their immediate environment, most likely salivary constituents. the ability of oral bacteria to use the oligosaccharide side-chains of salivary glycoproteins was then explored. exoglycosidases for the preferred anomeric linkages of the principal monosaccharide units of salivary glycoproteins were produced both by oral bacteria in vitro and by dental plaque in vivo. thus plaque flora has the potential to degrade glycoproteins and this may explain how bacteria in the grooves grow in the absence of dietary food.
