TI  == a large-scale genetic screen for mutants with altered salicylic acid accumulation in arabidopsis.
AB  == salicylic acid (sa) is a key defense signal molecule against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens in plants, but how sa is synthesized in plant cells still remains elusive. identification of new components involved in pathogen-induced sa accumulation would help address this question. to this end, we performed a large-scale genetic screen for mutants with altered sa accumulation during pathogen infection in arabidopsis using a bacterial biosensor acinetobacter sp. adpwh_lux-based sa quantification method. a total of 35,000 m2  plants in the npr1-3 mutant background have been individually analyzed for the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (psm) es4326-induced sa accumulation. among the mutants isolated, 19 had sa levels lower than npr1 (sln)  and two exhibited increased sa accumulation in npr1 (isn). complementation tests  revealed that seven of the sln mutants are new alleles of eds5/sid1, two are sid2/eds16 alleles, one is allelic to pad4, and the remaining seven sln and two isn mutants are new non-allelic sa accumulation mutants. interestingly, a large group of mutants (in the npr1-3 background), in which psm es4326-induced sa levels were similar to those in the wild-type columbia plants, were identified, suggesting that the signaling network fine-tuning pathogen-induced sa accumulation is complex. we further characterized the sln1 single mutant and found that psm es4326-induced defense responses were compromised in this mutant.  these defense response defects could be rescued by exogenous sa, suggesting that  sln1 functions upstream of sa. the sln1 mutation was mapped to a region on the north arm of chromosome i, which contains no known genes regulating pathogen-induced sa accumulation, indicating that sln1 likely encodes a new regulator of sa biosynthesis. thus, the new sln and isn mutants identified in this genetic screen are valuable for dissecting the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen-induced sa accumulation in plants.

TI  == a high-throughput method for isolation of salicylic acid metabolic mutants.
AB  == background: salicylic acid (sa) is a key defense signal molecule against biotrophic pathogens in plants. quantification of sa levels in plants is critical for dissecting the sa-mediated immune response. although hplc and gc/ms are routinely used to determine sa concentrations, they are expensive and time-consuming. we recently described a rapid method for a bacterial biosensor acinetobacter sp. adpwh_lux-based sa quantification, which enables high-throughput analysis. in this study we describe an improved method for fast sample preparation, and present a high-throughput strategy for isolation of sa metabolic mutants. results: on the basis of the previously described biosensor-based method, we simplified the tissue collection and the sa extraction procedure. leaf discs were collected and boiled in luria-bertani (lb), and then the released sa was measured with the biosensor. the time-consuming steps of weighing samples, grinding tissues and centrifugation were avoided. the direct boiling protocol detected similar differences in sa levels among pathogen-infected wild-type, npr1 (nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes), and sid2 (sa induction-deficient) plants as did the previously described biosensor-based method and an hplc-based approach, demonstrating the efficacy of  the protocol presented here. we adapted this protocol to a high-throughput format and identified six npr1 suppressors that accumulated lower levels of sa than npr1 upon pathogen infection. two of the suppressors were found to be allelic to the previously identified eds5 mutant. the other four are more susceptible than npr1  to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola es4326 and their identity merits further investigation. conclusions: the rapid sa extraction method by direct boiling of leaf discs further reduced the cost and time required for the biosensor acinetobacter sp. adpwh_lux-based sa estimation, and allowed the screening for npr1 suppressors that accumulated less sa than npr1 after pathogen infection in a high-throughput manner. the highly efficacious sa estimation protocol can be applied in genetic screen for sa metabolic mutants and characterization of enzymes involved in sa metabolism. the mutants isolated in this study may help identify new components in the sa-related signaling pathways.

TI  == quantitative in situ assay of salicylic acid in tobacco leaves using a genetically modified biosensor strain of acinetobacter sp. adp1.
AB  == salicylic acid (sa) plays important roles in plants, most notably in the induction of systemic acquired resistance (sar) against pathogens. a non-destructive in situ assay for sa would provide new insights into the functions of sa in sar and other sa-regulated phenomena. we assessed a genetically engineered strain of acinetobacter sp. adp1, which proportionally produces bioluminescence in response to salicylates including sa and methylsalicylate, as a reporter for salicylate accumulation in the apoplast of plant leaves. sa was measured quantitatively in situ in nn genotype tobacco (nicotiana tabacum l. cv xanthi-nc) leaves inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus (tmv). the biosensor revealed accumulation of apoplastic sa before the visible appearance of hypersensitive response (hr) lesions. when the biosensor was infiltrated into tmv-inoculated leaves displaying hr lesions at 90 and 168 h post-inoculation, salicylate accumulation was detected predominantly in tissues surrounding the lesions and in veins adjacent to hr lesions. these images are consistent with previous data demonstrating that sa accumulation occurs prior to  and following the onset of visible hr lesions. we also used the biosensor to observe apoplastic sa accumulation in tobacco leaves inoculated with virulent and hr-eliciting strains of the bacterial plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae. the work demonstrates that the acinetobacter sp. adp1 biosensor is a useful new tool  to non-destructively assay salicylates in situ and to map their spatial distribution in plant tissues.
