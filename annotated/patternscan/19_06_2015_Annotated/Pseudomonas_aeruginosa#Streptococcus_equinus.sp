TI  == antimicrobial activities of chicken beta-defensin (4 and 10) peptides against pathogenic bacteria and fungi.
AB  == host defense peptides (hdps) are small cationic peptides found in several organisms. they play a vital role in innate immunity response and immunomodulatory stimulation. this investigation was designed to study the antimicrobial activities of beta-defensin peptide-4 (savbd-4) and 10 (savbd-4) derived from chickens against pathogenic organisms including bacteria and fungi.  ten bacterial strains and three fungal species were used in investigation. the results showed that the savbd-10 displayed a higher bactericidal potency against  all the tested bacterial strains than that of savbd-4. the exhibited bactericidal activity was significant against almost the different bacterial strains at different peptide concentrations except for that of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa) and streptococcus bovis (str. bovis) strains where a moderate effect  was noted. both peptides were effective in the inactivation of fungal species tested yielding a killing rate of up to 95%. the results revealed that the synthetic peptides were resistant to salt at a concentration of 50 mm nacl. however, they lost antimicrobial potency when applied in the presence of high salt concentrations. based on blood hemolysis studies, a little hemolytic effect  was showed in the case of both peptides even when applied at high concentrations. the data obtained from this study indicated that synthetic avian peptides exhibit strong antibacterial and antifungal activity. in conclusion, future work and research should be tailored to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of those peptides and their potential use in the pharmaceutical industry to help  reduce the incidence and impact of infectious agent and be marketed as a naturally occurring antibiotic.

TI  == a study on the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved  in skin and meibomian gland lesions of demodectic mange in cattle.
AB  == the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected  animals was investigated. demodex bovis and d. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. the mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes (group a)) and opportunistic organisms (proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and moraxella bovis and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes (group a) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. the nature of association between demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent  microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. the "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.

TI  == antimicrobial constituents and synergism effect of the essential oils from cymbopogon citratus and alpinia galanga.
AB  == from the fresh leaf sheathes of lemongrass (cymbopogon citratus) and rhizomes of  galanga (alpinia galanga) light yellow and colorless oils, respectively, were obtained by hydrodistillation and microwave assisted extraction (mae) in yields of 0.24% and 0.03%, and 0.11% and trace (w/w), respectively. by gc/ms analysis, five major constituents were identified in lemongrass oil, e-citral, z-citral, beta-myrcene, selina-6-en-4-ol, and cis-ocimene, and five in galanga oil, 1,8-cineole, phenol 4-(2-propenyl)-acetate, dl-limonene, alpha-pinene, and a-terpineol. three major components of the combined lemongrass and galanga oils (ratio 7:3, 1:1, 3:7) were 1,8-cineole (46.3%, 31.5%, 19.3%), e-citral (12.8%, 22.7%, 32.8%) and z-citral (8.5%, 15.2%, 21.6%). the mics of lemongrass and galanga oils were: against staphylococcus aureus 0.5% and 4%, v/v, against pseudomonas aeruginosa 40% and >40%,v/v, against streptococcus bovis 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v, and against candida albicans 0.25% and 0.5%, v/v. citral (from lemongrass oil) gave greater potentiation than 1,8-cineole (from galanga oil). the combination profiles of galanga oil with lemongrass oil (volume ratios 3:7, 1:1, and 7:3) were tested against the four pathogenic microorganisms. synergistic activity was best noted for only one ratio (volume ratio 3:7) as the sigmafic< 1  against all tested microorganisms. the present investigation provides evidenc that the utilization of two essential oils in combination should be assessed for  synergistic antimicrobial activity in order to reduce their minimum effective dose.

TI  == combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography  in the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis: a case series.
AB  == background: the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is challenging. the gold standard for prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis is trans-esophageal echocardiography. however, trans-esophageal echocardiography may result in negative findings or yield images difficult to differentiate from thrombus in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a potentially promising diagnostic tool for several infectious conditions and it has also been employed in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis but data are still scant. case presentations: we reviewed the charts of 6 patients with prosthetic aortic valves evaluated for suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, at two different hospital, over a 3-year period. we found 3 patients with early-onset pve cases and blood cultures yielding pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus lugdunensis, respectively; and 3 late-onset cases in the remaining 3 patients with isolation in the blood of streptococcus bovis, candida  albicans and p. aeruginosa, respectively. initial trans-esophageal echocardiography was negative in all the patients, while fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed images suspicious for prosthetic valve endocarditis. in 4 out of 6 patients valve replacement was done with histology confirming the prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis. after an adequate course  of antibiotic therapy fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed resolution of prosthetic valve endocarditis in all the patients. conclusion: our  experience confirms the potential role of fluoroseoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and follow-up of prosthetic valve endocarditis.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == lipopeptide biosurfactants from paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  == although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. these solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. this led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of paenibacillus polymyxa (ppe). a combination of rphplc and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of ppe as fusaricidin b (li-fo4b) and polymyxin d1, with minor contributions from surfactins. this complex (ppe) reduced the biofilm biomass of bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis. in contrast, ampicillin was only effective against s. aureus. ppe also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (samb) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established samb by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. the effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against  single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of an acquired subgroup b3 metallo-beta-lactamase gene, blaaim-1, and its unique genetic context in pseudomonas aeruginosa from australia.
AB  == three clinical pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (wch2677, wch2813, and wch2837) isolated from the women's and children's hospital, adelaide, australia, produced  a metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-positive etest result. all isolates were pcr negative for known mbl genes. a gene bank was created, and an mbl gene, designated bla(aim-1), was cloned and fully characterized. the encoded enzyme, aim-1, is a group b3 mbl that has the highest level of identity to thin-b and l1. it is chromosomal and flanked by two copies (one intact and one truncated) of an  iscr element, iscr15. southern hybridization studies indicated the movement of both iscr15 and bla(aim-1) within the three different clinical isolates. aim-1 hydrolyzes most beta-lactams, with the exception of aztreonam and, to a lesser extent, ceftazidime; however, it possesses significantly higher k(cat) values for cefepime and carbapenems than most other mbls. aim-1 was the first mobile group b3 enzyme detected and signals further problems for already beleaguered antimicrobial regimes to treat serious p. aeruginosa and other gram-negative infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of mycobacterium bovis.
AB  == bovine tuberculosis caused by mycobacterium bovis is an important zoonosis. in this study, a simple, rapid method for detecting this organism was developed based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification of the mpt83 gene. the technique  will be of value in the clinical and field-based diagnosis of m. bovis and can differentiate it from other bacteria such as corynebacterium diphtheriae, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the limit of detection was 10 copies/mul and the results were corroborated by pcr. the method was highly specific and more sensitive than pcr.

TI  == evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  == background: platelet (plt) bacterial contamination (pbc) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. it is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. study design and methods: pbc was studied  by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from july 1991 to december 2004. active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old plts at issue and intermittent use of gram stain, ph measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (sdp) units. results: active surveillance detected  38 instances of pbc, 7 in sdp units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor plt units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; n = 27), staphylococcus aureus (4), bacillus cereus (1), serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 s. bovis, 1 s. uberis), and cons with viridans group streptococcus (1). only one instance of contamination, caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per ml at time of issue. pbc was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through gram stain screening. transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). ph testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of sdp units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. conclusion: improved active surveillance methods for detecting pbc are needed to improve the  safety of plt transfusions.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == improved survival in experimental sepsis with an orally administered inhibitor of apoptosis.
AB  == the pathophysiology of sepsis involves excessive lymphocyte apoptosis, which correlates with adverse outcomes, and disordered cytokine production, which may promote host injury. as the protease inhibitor (pi) class of antiretroviral agents is known to prevent apoptosis in vitro, we evaluated their effect on survival, lymphocyte apoptosis, and consequent cytokine production in mice with sepsis induced by cecal ligation and perforation. mice pretreated with pis have improved survival (67%; p<0.0005) compared with controls (17%) and a significant  (p<0.05) reduction in lymphocyte apoptosis. even mice receiving therapy beginning 4 h after perforation demonstrated improved survival (50%; p<0.05) compared with  controls. pi therapy is also associated with an increase in the th1 cytokine tnf-alpha (p<0.05) early in sepsis and a reduction in the th2 cytokines il-6 and  il-10 (p<0.05) late in sepsis; despite no intrinsic antibacterial effects, pi also reduced quantitative bacterial blood cultures. the beneficial effects of pi  appear to be specific to lymphocyte apoptosis, as lymphocyte-deficient rag1-/- mice did not experience benefit from treatment with pi. thus, inhibition of lymphocyte apoptosis by pi is a candidate approach for the treatment of sepsis.

TI  == resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  == background: lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. in this  work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. results: bovine gastric extract  (bge) was active against both g+ and g- bacteria, but the effect against gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified bgl had only activity against gram+ bacteria. we were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the bge, and found that the inhibition of gram negative bacteria by bge was due to an artefact caused by acetate. we report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (bg lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific  resistance of some rumen gram positive strains to bgl. conclusions: some gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. we discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefpirome, a new fourth-generation cephalosporin in comparison with other agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefpirome was compared with amoxycillin/clavulanic  acid, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and amikacin against 743 non-duplicate clinical isolates. mic50 and mic90 showed that the antibiotic was active against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. cefpirome was highly active against most of the enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive proteus spp., aeromonas spp. (mic < or = 1 mg/l) and salmonella spp. (mic < or = 0.5 mg/l). neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were all susceptible, with mic less than 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l respectively. cefpirome was more active than cefuroxime and ceftazidime against campylobacter spp. (mic < or = 2 mg/l), but less active than  ceftazidime against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefpirome was active against streptococcus pneumoniae. streptococcus bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic < or = 0.5 mg/l) and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mic < or = 2 mg/l). methicillin-resistant s. aureus, gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes were resistant to cefpirome. the stability of cefpirome to tem-1, tem-2, pse-1, shv-1 and the chromosomal-mediated p99 and k-1 beta-lactamases was comparable to ceftazidime.

AB  == microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. no microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of  17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including pseudomonas aeruginosa,  serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.

TI  == [community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. iii. microbiological aspects].
AB  == a retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the ivrea-castellamonte hospital (turin, italy). a total of 4386 vials  from 619 patients were examined. there were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. there were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). a total of 165 microorganism were isolated: gram-positive (52.7%) and gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). the predominant families were: enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), micrococcaceae (27.3%), pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and streptococcus "genus" (18.8%). the species frequencies  were: escherichia coli (20%), staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), enterococcus (8.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), proteus mirabilis (4.2%), brucella spp. (2.4%), bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus bovis e propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). these findings are compared with those published in the italian and international literature. stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == the in vitro activity of norfloxacin (mk366) against 477 aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates was compared to that of nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. norfloxacin was more active than the other agents against all gram-negative organisms tested. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of pseudomonas aeruginosa were less than or equal to 0.125-32 mg/l with 90% inhibited (mic90) by 4 mg/l; mics of the enterobacteriaceae including serratia marcescens were less than or equal to 0.125-8 mg/l with an mic90 of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. there was also excellent activity against the gram-positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus and the enterococci, with mics less than or equal to 0.125-4 mg/l and an mic90 less than  or equal to 4 mg/l. only 8 of 477 organisms were norfloxacin-resistant (mic greater than or equal to 16 mg/l): 3 of 100 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 of 10 pseudomonas maltophilia and 2 of 15 streptococcus bovis strains. in contrast, 97% of the gram-positive cocci and 49% of the gram-negative bacilli were nalidixic acid-resistant (mic greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). norfloxacin shows excellent activity against a wide range of bacteria and merits further study as a urinary antibacterial agent.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ly 127935 (6059-s), seven cephalosporins, three  aminoglycosides, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  == ly 127935 (6059-s), a new semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic was tested simultaneously with 6 cephalosporins, 3 aminoglycosides, carbenicillin and ticarcillin against 398 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. many of the organisms were selected for study because of known resistance to one or more of the clinically available antibiotics tested. escherichia coli, klebsiella, serratia and providencia were susceptible to ly 127935. some resistant strains of enterobacter, proteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter were also resistant to ly 127935, but many of the strains resistant to other antibiotics were susceptible to ly 127935. the activity of ly  127935 against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans and streptococcus bovis was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine. ly 127935 was not active against methicillin-resistant s. aureus nor enterococcus.

TI  == immunological method to differentiate between antigens of tubercle bacilli, other mycobacterial species, and non-acid-fast bacteria.
AB  == sera from rabbits immunized with sonicates of mycobacterium bovis bcg were passed through an immunoadsorbent made of a soluble bcg extract to make partially purified antibodies to bcg. these antibodies were in turn used to prepare an immunoadsorbent through which the bcg extract was passed. the partially purified  antigenic material was radiolabeled and subjected to electrophoresis in acrylamide gels. one of the radiolabeled fractions isolated (bcg-c) was found to  bind to antibodies to bcg and h37rv, but not to antibodies in sera from rabbits immunized with other mycobacterial species or nocardia asteroides. the reaction between bcg-c and the partially purified antibodies to bcg was inhibited by small amounts of different bcg antigens. cultures obtained from 25 patients with tuberculous diseases, other bacterial cultures, and various bacterial extracts were tested for their capacity to inhibit this reaction. each of 13 mycobacteria  identified as m. tuberculosis inhibited this reaction. equivalent numbers of 12 strains of mycobacteria other than m. tuberculosis and high concentrations of other bacterial extracts did not inhibit, indicating that determinants of bcg present in m. tuberculosis were not detected in the other mycobacteria or in non-acid-fast bacteria. the use of sequential purification procedures could be of potential clinical value in quickly differentiating between m. tuberculosis and a variety of other mycobacteria.
