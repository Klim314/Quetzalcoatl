TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == evaluation of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections using checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in 111 selected cases of single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. methods: samples were collected from the  root canals using #15 hedstroen-type files and two sterile paper points, which were introduced 1 mm short of the apical foramen. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 different bacterial species in each sample were determined using dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization techniques. results: the  mean number of species per sample was 22. enterococcus faecalis (89.3%), campylobacter gracilis (89.3%), leptotrichia buccalis (89.3%), neisseria mucosa (87.5%), prevotella melaninogenica (86.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii (85.7%), eubacterium saburreum (75.9%), streptococcus anginosus (75%),  and veillonella parvula (74.1%) were the most prevalent species. the species found in highest mean counts (over 10(5)) were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii (13.14 x 10(5)), e. saburreum (5.67 x 10(5)), e. faecalis (5.38 x 10(5)), n. mucosa (4.19 x 10(5)), v. parvula (3.63 x 10(5)), c. gracilis (3.46 x 10(5)), treponema  socranskii (3.34 x 10(5)), porphyromonas endodontalis (2.96 x 10(5)), porphyromonas gingivalis (2.85 x 10(5)), micromonas micros (2.81 x 10(5)), prevotella nigrescens (2.68 x 10(5)) and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (2.64 x 10(5)). most of these species were also found in high proportions. conclusions: our results suggest that several bacterial species considered to be  oral pathogens seem to be implicated in the etiology of primary endodontic infections.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

TI  == evaluation of the rapid id 32a system for identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the rapid id 32a system (biomerieux, marcy-l'etoile, france) for the identification of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, excluding the  bacteroides fragilis group. methods: five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-b. fragilis group anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were tested in the rapid id 32a system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. results: the rapid id 32a system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. a further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by  the manufacturer. fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level  only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. three isolates of prevotella were not identified by the system. of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. conclusions: the rapid id 32a system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-b. fragilis group, anaerobic gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. there was poor discrimination between fusobacterium nucleatum and f. necrophorum, between porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis, and between prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella oralis. the need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.

TI  == inhibition of prevotella and capnocytophaga immunoglobulin a1 proteases by human  serum.
AB  == oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin  a1 (iga1) proteases cleaving human iga1 in the hinge region into intact fab and fc fragments. to investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven prevotella and capnocytophaga proteases. all or nearly all of the sera inhibited the iga1 protease activity of prevotella buccae, prevotella oris, and prevotella loescheii. a minor proportion of the sera inhibited prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica iga1 proteases, while no sera inhibited capnocytophaga ochracea iga1 protease. all inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. no correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. the nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the iga1 proteases of p. buccae, p. oris, and p. loescheii was further examined. in size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of iga. additional inhibition of the p.  oris iga1 protease was found in fractions containing both iga and igg. purification of the igg fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein g column resulted in recovery of inhibitory igg antibodies against all three iga1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the p. oris enzyme. these  finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing  antibodies.

TI  == emended descriptions of prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii, prevotella veroralis, and prevotella melaninogenica.
AB  == during studies of human periodontal disease, a number of bacterial strains were encountered that, on the basis of results of standard biochemical tests, appeared to be prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, or prevotella loescheii. however, use of the standard biochemical tests, cellular fatty acid analyses, and the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns of soluble proteins resulted in conflicting identifications of these strains. the results of tests for cellobiose fermentation, inulin fermentation, and pigment production were responsible for most of the discordant results. cellular fatty acid analyses in which the microbial identification system was used did not differentiate these strains from validly described species, even though separate  library entries were created for them. dna reassociation determinations in which  the s1 nuclease procedure was used showed that cellobiose fermentation and pigment production are variable among strains of p. melaninogenica and p. denticola and that fermentation of xylan is not a reliable characteristic for differentiating p. buccalis from prevotella veroralis. in contrast to previous indications, most strains of p. veroralis do not ferment xylan. these species can be differentiated by dna-dna reassociation and by cellular fatty acid analysis, using the microbial identification system, but differentiation by currently described phenotypic characteristics is not reliable. similarly, p. loescheii and the genetically distinct (but closely related) d1c-20 group cannot be distinguished reliably from each other or from p. veroralis, p. denticola, and p. melaninogenica on the basis of currently described phenotypic tests other than cellular fatty acid composition or, for some species, electrophoretic patterns of soluble whole-cell proteins.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == the use of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of bacteroides intermedius isolates in a dot blot assay.
AB  == bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. these two groups are represented by the type strain of the species atcc 25611t (b. intermedius type i) and by atcc 33563 (b. intermedius type ii). members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by  sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and by dna-dna homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. the purpose of this study was to prepare specific dna probes for the two groups of bacteroides intermedius and  to test them against field isolates. whole-cell dna probes were prepared from b.  intermedius types i and ii and tested against 253 field strains of bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as b. intermedius. of  these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the b. intermedius type i dna probe, 28 (11%) with the type ii, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the b. intermedius probes but  did hybridize with either b. melaninogenicus, b. loescheii, or b. corporis whole-cell dna probes. the 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five bacteroides probes or with probes to b. asaccharolyticus, b. buccae, b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. gingivalis, b. oralis, or b. oris. these data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.

TI  == use of the rapid-ana system to screen for enzyme activities that differ among species of bile-inhibited bacteroides.
AB  == the rapid-ana system (innovative diagnostics systems, inc., atlanta, ga.) was used to test 102 strains of 14 species of phenotypically similar bile-inhibited bacteroides from humans. bacteroides oris, bacteroides veroralis, bacteroides buccalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, and bacteroides denticola had very similar enzyme activity profiles. clear differentiation of these six species by the rapid-ana system was not possible, but tests for arginine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase were helpful. bacteroides oralis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, and bacteroides buccae each had unique enzyme activity profiles. no consistent differences in enzyme activities were found between the two dna homology groups within bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, or bacteroides intermedius. tests for glycine aminopeptidase, alpha-galactosidase, arginine aminopeptidase, alpha-fucosidase, n-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction of triphenyltetrazolium, and production of indole were helpful in the differentiation of the species studied.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of some non-saccharolytic and saccharolytic bacteroides species.
AB  == various bacteroides spp. were examined by physiological tests, presence of specific enzymes, antibiotic sensitivity, menaquinone composition and a few miscellaneous tests. the data matrix containing 58 strains and 55 unit characters was examined using gower's similarity coefficients (sg) and included matching negative character states and multistate characters. the highly saccharolytic strains were separated from the less saccharolytic and non-fermentative strains at the 55% similarity level; while at the slightly higher level of 63% strains of capnocytophaga (formerly bact. ochraceus) were recovered as a compact phenon distinct from other saccharolytic species. the phenogram was divided into 6 clusters at 72% similarity level. most of the 'bact. fragilis group' of species clustered in one phenon while bact. melaninogenicus ssp. melaninogenicus, bact. bivius and a new species, bact. denticola, formed another group. another phenon comprised the saccharolytic non-pigmented species closely related to bact. oralis such as bact. buccalis and bact. pentosaceus. the less saccharolytic strains of bact. melaninogenicus ssp. intemedius and bact. disiens were recovered in a distinct phenon. the low affinity (less than 55% similarity) between the two subspecies of bact. melaninogenicus emphasised the need for reclassifying these taxa into separate species. the non-fermentative and very weakly saccharolytic strains formed good taxospecies. the separation of this cluster into three subclusters is in excellent agreement with chemotaxonomic data now available.

TI  == the isolation and identification of bacteroides spp. from the normal human gingival flora.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated on an enriched selective medium from specimens of subgingival plaque from 20 normal, healthy adults without periodontal disease. a heavy growth of bacteroides and fusobacterium spp. was obtained from all specimens and 10 representative colonies from each subject were selected for identification by conventional bacteriological methods. results were obtained in these tests with 188 isolates; some strains of the b. melaninogenicus/oralis group would not grow in pure culture on solid media and showed satellitism in mixed culture, and some strains of fusobacteria did not survive repeated subculture. most isolates (68%) belonged to the b. melaninogenicus/oralis group. the commonest species identified in this group were b. oralis (41%), b. melaninogenicus ss. melaninogenicus (26%) and ss. intermedius (17%). b. oralis was isolated from all subjects and at least one strain of b. melaninogenicus was isolated from 18 out of 20 subjects. only eight strains of the b. fragilis group were detected and they probably represented transient carriage. fusobacterium spp. and l. buccalis were isolated from 15 out of 20 subjects and accounted for 21% of the isolates studied, but most could not be identified specifically by the set of tests used. asaccharolytic species of bacteroides were isolated in small numbers from seven subjects.

TI  == blastogenic response of human lymphocytes to oral bacterial antigens: comparison  of individuals with periodontal disease to normal and edentulous subjects.
AB  == cell-mediated immunity in humans to antigens derived from oral plaque bacteria was investigated by using the lymphocyte blastogenesis assay. subjects with varying severities of periodontal disease including normal, gingivitis, periodontitis, and edentulous were compared. mononuclear leukocytes were separated from peripheral blood and cultured with antigens prepared by sonication of actinomyces viscosus (av), actinomyces naeslundii (an), veillonella alcalescens (va), leptotrichia buccalis (lb), bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm), and homologous dental plaque (dp). the lymphocyte response of subjects with gingivitis or periodontitis was significantly greater than that of normal subjects to antigens of av, an, and dp, but did not differ from the response of edentulous subjects. periodontitis subjects were significantly more reactive than edentulous and normal subjects in response to va, lb, and bm. these findings suggest that the tested gram-negative bacteria and the host response they evoke are associated with advanced periodontal destruction.
