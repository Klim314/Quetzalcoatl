TI  - Aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in Poland.
AB  - We conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. We included 130 turtles in the study. The aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated from free-living adults. We isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were Cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), Enterococcus faecalis (96/96), Escherichia coli (58/96), and Proteus mirabilis (41/96). From the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovars Newport, Daytona, and Braenderup; Listeria monocytogenes; Yersinia enterocolitica; Yersinia ruckeri; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Vibrio fluvialis; and Serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., Aeromonas sobria, Aeromonas caviae, Hafnia alvei, Edwardsiella tarda, and Citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). The cloacal bacterial biota of the European pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. The small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the European pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.
TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - In Vitro Antibacterial Activity of Several Plant Extracts and Oils against Some Gram-Negative Bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants are considered new resources for producing agents that could act as alternatives to antibiotics in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of 28 plant extracts and oils against four Gram-negative bacterial species. METHODS: Experimental, in vitro, evaluation of the activities of 28 plant extracts and oils as well as some antibiotics against E. coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica O9, Proteus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae was performed. The activity against 15 isolates of each bacterium was determined by disc diffusion method at a concentration of 5%. Microdilution susceptibility assay was used in order to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the plant extracts, oils, and antibiotics. RESULTS: Among the evaluated herbs, only Origanum syriacum L., Thymus syriacus Boiss., Syzygium aromaticum L., Juniperus foetidissima Wild, Allium sativum L., Myristica fragrans Houtt, and Cinnamomum zeylanicum L. essential oils and Laurus nobilis L. plant extract showed anti-bacterial activity. The MIC50 values of these products against the Gram-negative organisms varied from 1.5 (Proteus spp. and K. pneumoniae( and 6.25 microl/ml (Yersinia enterocolitica O9 ) to 12.5 microl/ml (E. coli O:157). CONCLUSION: Among the studied essential oils, O. syriacum L., T. syriacus Boiss., C. zeylanicum L., and S. aromaticum L. essential oils were the most effective. Moreover, Cephalosporin and Ciprofloxacin were the most effective antibiotics against almost all the studied bacteria. Therefore, O. syriacum L., T. syriacus Boiss., C. zeylanicum L., and S. aromaticum L. could act as bactericidal agents against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbit with Entamoeba histolytica by ERIC-PCR.
AB  - Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR was applied to analyze the difference of intestinal microbial community diversity between healthy and orally infected rabbits with Entamoeba histolytica. The dynamic changes in different parts of digestive system including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and rectum in healthy and infected rabbits at different time points were also tested. The intestinal microbial community of the control healthy rabbits was steady, and the total number of ERIC-PCR bands in the control healthy rabbit was the least in the rectum and the most in the caecum. ERIC-PCR bands of orally inoculated rabbits did not obviously change until 24 h after postinoculation (p.i.). The numbers of the ERIC-PCR bands gradually decreased from 24 to 72 h p.i., and then, with the development of disease, the band numbers gradually increased until 6 days p.i. Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 1,200 bp of infected ileum sampled at 32 h p.i. were above 95 % with Sinorhizobium meliloti enterobacterial, Erwinia amylovora and Salmonella typhimurium, and the nucleotide sequence homologies of the fragment about 300 bp of infected ileum sampled at 48 h p.i. were more than 90 % with Xanthomonas campestris enterobacterial, Yersinia enterocolitica subsp., Shigella flexneri, S. meliloti enterobacterial, Yersinia pestis, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp., and Escherichia coli. The prominent bacteria had changed after E. histolytica infection. The DNAstar of staple of ERIC-PCR showed that aerobe and facultative aerobe (E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella) became preponderant bacilli in the intestine of orally infected rabbits with E. histolytica.
TI  - A rapid subtractive immunization method to prepare discriminatory monoclonal antibodies for food E. coli O157:H7 contamination.
AB  - To detect food E. coli O157:H7 contamination rapidly and accurately, it is essential to prepare high specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the pathogen. Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-mediated subtractive immunization strategy was performed in mice to generate mAbs that react with E. coli O157:H7, but not with other affiliated bacteria. Specificity of 19 mAbs was evaluated by ELISA and/or dot-immunogold filtration assay (DIGFA). Immunogloubin typing, affinity and binding antigens of 5 selected mAbs were also analysed. MAbs 1D8, 4A7, 5A2 were found to have high reactivity with E. coli O157:H7 and no cross-reactivity with 80 other strains of bacteria including Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Proteus sp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and other non-E. coli O157:H7 enteric bacteria. Their ascetic titers reached 1:10(6) with E. coli O157:H7 and affinity constants ranged from 1.57 x 10(10) to 2.79 x 10(10) L/mol. The antigens recognized by them were different localized proteins. Furthermore, immune-colloidal gold probe coated with mAb 5A2 could specifically distinguish minced beef contaminated by E. coli O157:H7 from 84 other bacterial contaminations. The Cy-mediated subtractive immunization procedure coupled with hybridoma technology is a rapid and efficient approach to prepare discriminatory mAbs for detection of E. coli O157:H7 contamination in food.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - Development of a DNA microarray for detection and identification of Legionella pneumophila and ten other pathogens in drinking water.
AB  - The safety and accessibility of drinking water are major concerns throughout the  world. Consumption of water contaminated with infectious agents, toxic chemicals or radiological hazards represents a significant health risk and is strongly associated with mortality. Therefore, we have developed an oligonucleotide-based microarray using the sequences of 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS) and the gyrase subunit B gene (gyrB) found in the most prevalent and devastating waterborne pathogenic agents. This new diagnostic contains 26 specific probes and can simultaneously detect Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio choleraeo, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica and Leptospira interrogans. Testing was carried out against a total of 218 bacterial strains, including 53 representative strains, 103 clinical isolates and 62 strains of other bacterial species belonging to 10 genera and 48 species. The results were specific and reproducible, with a detection sensitivity of 0.1 ng DNA or 10(4)CFU/ml achieved for pure cultures of each target organism. The diluted cultures and real drinking water samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. This novel diagnostic method is superior in time- and labor-efficiency to conventional bacterial culture and antiserum agglutination, and can be readily applied to epidemiological surveillance and other food safety applications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Artemisia nilagirica leaf extracts against clinical and phytopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The six organic solvent extracts of Artemisia nilagirica were screened for the potential antimicrobial activity against phytopathogens and clinically important standard reference bacterial strains. METHODS: The agar disk diffusion method was used to study the antibacterial activity of A. nilagirica extracts against 15 bacterial strains. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the plant extracts were tested using two fold agar dilution method at concentrations ranging from 32 to 512 microg/ml. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out for major phytochemical derivatives in A. nilagirica. RESULTS: All the extracts showed inhibitory activity for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus. The hexane extract was found to be effective against all phytopathogens with low MIC of 32 microg/ml and the methanol extract exhibited a higher inhibition activity against Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhi, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (32 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (64 microg/ml) and Shigella flaxneri (128 microg/ml). The phytochemical screening of extracts answered for the major derivative of alkaloids, amino acids, flavonoids, phenol, quinines, tannins and terpenoids. CONCLUSION: All the extracts showed antibacterial activity against the tested strains. Of all, methanol and hexane extracts showed high inhibition against clinical and phytopathogens, respectively. The results also indicate the presence of major phytochemical derivatives in the A. nilagirica extracts. Hence, the isolation and purification of therapeutic potential compounds from A. nilagirica could be used as an effective source against bacterial diseases in human and plants.
TI  - Neonatal enteral feeding tubes as loci for colonisation by members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine whether neonatal nasogastric enteral feeding tubes are colonised by the opportunistic pathogen Cronobacter spp. (Enterobacter sakazakii) and other Enterobacteriaceae, and whether their presence was influenced by the feeding regime. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-nine tubes were collected from two neonatal intensive care units (NICU). A questionnaire on feeding regime was completed with each sample. Enterobacteriaceae present in the tubes were identified using conventional and molecular methods, and their antibiograms determined. RESULTS: The neonates were fed breast milk (16%), fortified breast milk (28%), ready to feed formula (20%), reconstituted powdered infant formula (PIF, 6%), or a mixture of these (21%). Eight percent of tubes were received from neonates who were 'nil by mouth'. Organisms were isolated from 76% of enteral feeding tubes as a biofilm (up to 107 cfu/tube from neonates fed fortified breast milk and reconstituted PIF) and in the residual lumen liquid (up to 107 Enterobacteriaceae cfu/ml, average volume 250 mul). The most common isolates were Enterobacter cancerogenus (41%), Serratia marcescens (36%), E. hormaechei (33%), Escherichia coli (29%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Raoultella terrigena (10%), and S. liquefaciens (12%). Other organisms isolated included C. sakazakii (2%),Yersinia enterocolitica (1%),Citrobacter freundii (1%), E. vulneris (1%), Pseudomonas fluorescens (1%), and P. luteola (1%). The enteral feeding tubes were in place between < 6 h (22%) to > 48 h (13%). All the S. marcescens isolates from the enteral feeding tubes were resistant to amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav. Of additional importance was that a quarter of E. hormaechei isolates were resistant to the 3rd generation cephalosporins ceftazidime and cefotaxime. During the period of the study, K. pneumoniae and S. marcescens caused infections in the two NICUs. CONCLUSION: This study shows that neonatal enteral feeding tubes, irrespective of feeding regime, act as loci for the bacterial attachment and multiplication of numerous opportunistic pathogens within the Enterobacteriaceae family. Subsequently, these organisms will enter the stomach as a bolus with each feed. Therefore, enteral feeding tubes are an important risk factor to consider with respect to neonatal infections.
TI  - Differentiation of whole bacterial cells based on high-throughput microarray chip printing and infrared microspectroscopic readout.
AB  - Using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared microspectroscopic detection. Using this contact microspotting system, 24 microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of Listeria, 10 species of Vibrio, 2 strains of Photobacterium damselae, Yersinia enterocolitica 289, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14529, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 19075 (serotype 104 B), Shigella sonnei 20143, Klebsiella pneumoniae KP73, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii 200, and Escherichia coli. Microarrays consisting of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms. Two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the bacteria investigated down to the species level.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of blood and blood components in three major blood transfusion centers, Accra, Ghana.
AB  - Reports from studies conducted in several countries indicate a high incidence of  bacterial contamination of donor blood. The prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products in Ghana is not known. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of bacterial contamination of blood and its products at the three major blood transfusion centers in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Stored whole blood and its products were cultured on different media, and isolates were identified using standard biochemical and bacteriological methods. The susceptibility of the isolates to selected antimicrobial agents was also determined by the disc diffusion method. The overall prevalence rate was 9% (28/303; whole blood, 13% [24/192]; plasma, 3% [2/79]; platelet, 9% [2/22]). The Gram-positive bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, S. aureus, and Bacillus spp., and the Gram-negative organisms were Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to cloxacillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and gentamicin but resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, cefuroxime, and cotrimoxazole, while the Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to amikacin and gentamicin but resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime (except Y. enterocolitica), and cotrimoxazole. Our results suggest that bacterial contamination of blood and its products is prevalent in Ghana.
TI  - Cationic compounds with activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria: interest of a new compound compared with two older antiseptics, hexamidine and chlorhexidine.
AB  - Use of antiseptics and disinfectants is essential in infection control practices  in hospital and other healthcare settings. In this study, the in vitro activity of a new promising compound, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene (Cx1), has been evaluated in comparison with hexamidine (HX) and chlorhexidine (CHX), two older cationic antiseptics. The MICs for 69 clinical isolates comprising methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (with or without mecA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae producing various beta-lactamases and non-fermenting bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) were determined. Cx1 showed similar activity against S. aureus, CoNS and Enterococcus spp., irrespective of the presence of mecA or van genes, or associated resistance genes, with very good activity against CoNS (MIC <1 mg/L). Variable activities were observed against Enterobacteriaceae; the MICs determined seemed to be dependent both on the genus (MICs of 2, 8 and 64 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia enterocolitica, respectively) and on the resistance phenotype production of [Extended Spectrum beta-Lactase (ESBLs) or other beta-lactamases; overproduction of AmpC]. Poor activity was found against non-fermenting bacilli, irrespective of the resistance phenotype. CHX appeared to be the most active compound against all strains, with broad-spectrum and conserved activity against multidrug-resistant strains. HX showed a lower activity, essentially against Gram-positive strains. Consequently, the differences observed with respect to Cx1 suggest that they are certainly not the consequence of antibiotic resistance phenotypes, but rather the result of membrane composition modifications (e.g. of lipopolysaccharide), or of the presence of (activated) efflux-pumps. These results raise the possibility that Cx1 may be a potent new antibacterial agent of somewhat lower activity but significantly lower toxicity than CHX.
TI  - Determination of emitted airborne microorganisms from a BIO-PAK wastewater treatment plant.
AB  - Results of a study conducted to assess the degree of airborne microbial contamination generated by a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with bioreactor "BIO-PAK" closed treatment system and evaluation of the dispersion of potential pathogens are described. Over the year aerosol samples were collected simultaneously with sedimentation and impact methods from several plant sites and the surroundings. External upwind sites were used as control. Total colony-forming counts of heterotrophic psychrophilic, psychrotrophic, mesophilic, haemolytic bacteria, as well as members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Pseudomonas genera, actinomycetes and fungi (moulds, yeasts and yeast-like fungi) were determined. Their highest concentrations ranged up to 10(1)-10(3)CFU/m(3) (with the exception of moulds exceeding 2x10(4)) were determined in air sampled inside the bioreactor, its vicinity, and near the grate chamber. Higher species diversity of the family Enterobacteriaceae (including Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae ozaenae) in the air sampled inside or near the bioreactor may imply a health risk for staff exposed for longer periods of time. Notwithstanding, no increased emission of the analysed groups of microorganisms, including faecal bacteria, were found outside the WWTP.
TI  - Bacterial particle endocytosis by epithelial cells is selective and enhanced by tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands.
AB  - Bacterial pathogens use virulence strategies to invade epithelial barriers, but active processes of epithelial cells may also contribute to the endocytosis of microbial particles. To focus on the latter, we studied the uptake of fixed and fluorescently labeled bacterial particles in intestinal and bronchoepithelial cell cultures and found it to be enhanced in Caco-2BBe and NCI-H292 cells after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and an agonist antibody against the lymphotoxin beta receptor. Confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and transmission electron microscopy revealed that Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica were readily endocytosed, although there was scant uptake of Shigella sonnei, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae particles. Endocytosed Staphylococcus was often associated with cytoplasmic claudin-4 vesicles; this was not found for Yersinia, suggesting that cytokine treatment upregulated two distinct endocytosis pathways. Interestingly, when Staphylococcus and Yersinia were coincubated with epithelial monolayers, the cells were unlikely to take up Yersinia unless they had also endocytosed large numbers of Staphylococcus particles, although the two bacteria were apparently processed in distinct compartments. Cytokine treatment induced an upregulation and redistribution of beta1 integrin to the apical surface of NCI-H292 cells; consistent with this effect, treatment with anti-beta1 integrin antibody blocked uptake of both Yersinia and Staphylococcus in NCI-H292 and Caco-2BBe cells. Our results suggest that capture of bacterial particles by mucosal epithelial cells is selective and that different endocytic mechanisms are enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines.
TI  - Occurrence of Listeria and Enterobacteriaceae in domestic refrigerators.
AB  - Consumers' refrigeration practices have a significant impact on the safety and quality of foods. To determine the prevalence and the identity of microorganisms in domestic refrigerators, swab samples were taken from various locations in the refrigerators from 137 households in middle Tennessee. The swabs were inoculated into different media, and standard procedures were used to characterize the isolates. API 20E and API Listeria were used for identification of Enterobacteriaceae and Listeria spp., respectively. The Kirby-Bauer technique was used to test resistance of the isolates. Actual counts for aerobic and Enterobacteriaceae ranged from not detected to 8.53 and 8.39 log CFU per sample, respectively. Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (6.8%), Klebsiella terrigena (4.0%), Enterobacter sakazakii (2.2%), and Yersinia enterocolitica (0.7%) were some of the bacteria of concern that were isolated from domestic refrigerators. Resistance to antibiotics was most common in erythromycin (39.9%), followed by ampicillin (33.8%), cefoxitin (12.8%), tetracycline (5%), streptomycin (4.0%), nalidixic acid (2.1%), kanamycin (1.4%), and colistin (0.7%). None of the isolates tested was resistant to ciprofloxacin or gentamycin. Listeria spp. were also detected in six refrigerators. These findings underline the need for greater consumer education regarding proper refrigerator cleaning and safe food handling practices.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Identification of culturable stream water bacteria from urban, agricultural, and  forested watersheds using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - Bacteria present in water samples taken on a weekly basis, from June 2004 through June 2005, from three streams, were cultured on Coliscan Easygel agar plates. Colonies representative of a variety of colors and morphologies were subjected to amplification and sequencing of a 1000-1100 nt portion of the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 528 colonies were sequenced; these categorized into 26 genera and 78 species. Of 175 dark blue/purple colonies presumed to be E. coli, sequence analysis indicated that 45 (25%) were actually other genera. For the urban stream Gwynns Falls Gwynns Run, E. coli was the most common genus/species encountered, followed by Klebsiella and Aeromonas. For Pond Branch, a stream located in a forested watershed, it was Serratia, followed by Yersinia and Aeromonas. For McDonogh (MCDN), a stream associated with Zea mays (corn) row crop agriculture, E. coli was the most frequently isolated genus/species, followed by Aeromonas and Enterobacter. ERIC-PCR genotyping of isolates from the most prevalent genera/species, indicated a high degree of diversity within-stream for E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Conversely, genotyping of Y. enterocolitica isolates indicated that some were shared between different streams.
TI  - The YompC protein of Yersinia enterocolitica: molecular and physiological characterization.
AB  - The structural gene coding for YompC has been identified in the genome of a pathogenic strain of Yersinia enterocolitica O:9, and was subsequently cloned and sequenced. Detailed alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that YompC is a member of the OmpC porin family with the highest degree of homology to Klebsiella pneumoniae. The mutant lacking YompC porin was constructed by insertional inactivation of the yompC gene which resulted from the integration of suicide vector at the yompC locus. In intact cells of Y. enterocolitica, loss of the YompC protein reduced the outer membrane permeability for beta-lactam antibiotics and tetracycline and resulted in a 2-5-fold increase in resistance to these compounds, depending on their chemical properties. Mutation in the ompR regulatory gene resulted in the loss of both YompC and YompF porins, which led to a greater increase of resistance to antibiotics, as compared with the YompC mutant strain. Moreover, the binding assay with HEp-2 cells suggests that YompC may play a role in the adhesion properties of Y. enterocolitica strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. Nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Penicillium notatum. There was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhimurium, Alternaria citri, Alternaria tenuissima, and Gaeumannomyces graminis. Chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. Physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. Also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of plasma with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates pathogens while retaining coagulation function.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The INTERCEPT Blood System, a photochemical treatment (PCT) process,  has been developed to inactivate pathogens in platelet concentrates. These studies evaluated the efficacy of PCT to inactivate pathogens in plasma and the effect of PCT on plasma function. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Jumbo (600 mL) plasma units were inoculated with high titers of test pathogens and treated with 150 micromol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) long-wavelength ultraviolet light. The viability of each pathogen before and after treatment was measured with biological assays. Plasma function was evaluated through measurement of coagulation factors and antithrombotic protein activities. RESULTS: The levels of inactivation expressed as log-reduction were as follows: cell-free human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), greater than 6.8; cell-associated HIV-1, greater than 6.4; human T-lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I), 4.5; HTLV-II, greater than 5.7; hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus, greater than 4.5; duck HBV, 4.4 to 4.5; bovine viral diarrhea virus, 6.0; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 5.5; West Nile virus, 6.8; bluetongue virus, 5.1; human adenovirus 5, 6.8; Klebsiella pneumoniae, greater than 7.4; Staphylococcus epidermidis and Yersinia enterocolitica, greater than 7.3; Treponema pallidum, greater than 5.9; Borrelia burgdorferi, greater than 10.6; Plasmodium falciparum, 6.9; Trypanosoma cruzi, greater than 5.0; and Babesia microti, greater than 5.3. Retention of coagulation factor activity after PCT was expressed as the proportion of pretreatment (baseline) activity. Retention was 72 to 73 percent of baseline fibrinogen and Factor (F)VIII activity and 78 to 98 percent for FII, FV, FVII, F IX, FX, FXI, FXIII, protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and alpha2-antiplasmin. CONCLUSION: PCT of plasma inactivated high levels of a wide range of pathogens while maintaining adequate coagulation function. PCT has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases in patients requiring plasma transfusion support.
TI  - Production and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7, one of  the major causes of haemorrhagic colitis in humans, were produced by immunising Balb/c mice with the strain E. coli O157:H7. These monoclonal antibodies do not cross-react with other bacteria such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, E. coli O14, E. coli JM109, S. enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. panama, S. saintpaul, S. derby, S. muenchen, S. bredeney, S. hadar, Yersinia enterocolitica, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri, Listeria ivanovii, L. monocytogenes 13M, L. innocua, Enterobacter cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. amnigenus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia fergussoni or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the seven MAbs obtained, MAb 8B8C3 was selected to prepare a high-sensitivity sandwich ELISA method specific for O157:H7.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity studies on some piperidine and pyrrolidine substituted halogenobenzene derivatives.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds synthesised from some 1,2,3,5-tetrahalogeno benzenes in presence of sodium piperidide and sodium pyrrolidide (2,6-dipiperidino-1,4-dihalogenobenzenes; 2,6-dipyrrolidino-1,4-dibromobenzene; 2,4,6-tripyrrolidino chlorobenzene; and 1,3-dipyrrolidino benzene) were investigated. The in vitro antimicrobial activities were screened against the standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 as Gram positive, Yersinia enterocolitica ATCC 1501, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230 and Klebsiella pneumoniae as Gram negative, and Candida albicans as yeast-like fungus. Compounds (3, 5, 6, 7) inhibited the growth of all the test strains at MIC values of 32-512 microg/ml. None of the four compounds (1, 2,4,8) studied showed antimicrobial activity against any of the test strains within the MIC range 0.25-512 micro/ml.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Accelerating bacterial identification by infrared spectroscopy by employing microarray deposition of microorganisms.
AB  - A microarray method for the deposition of bacteria onto an agar slide was developed to accelerate the formation of microcolonies. Representative microarrays each consisting of 40 micro-spots of five replicates of eight foodborne bacteria (Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were printed on a Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) agar slide using a contact micro-spotting robotic system. Within 3 h, sufficient bacterial cells were obtained to allow accurate identification of the microorganism by infrared spectroscopy. This approach allows a "complete-in-a-single-day" analysis of a large array of samples.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Highly divergent RfaH orthologs from pathogenic proteobacteria can substitute for Escherichia coli RfaH both in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - The transcriptional enhancer protein RfaH positively regulates production of virulence factors in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium via a cis element, ops. Genes coding for RfaH orthologs were identified in conceptually translated genomes of bacterial pathogens, including Vibrio and Yersinia spp. We cloned the rfaH genes from Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae into E. coli expression vectors. Purified RfaH orthologs, including the most divergent one from V. cholerae, were readily recruited to the E. coli transcription elongation complex. Postrecruitment stimulation of transcript elongation appeared to vary with the degree of similarity to E. coli RfaH. V. cholerae RfaH was particularly defective in reducing downstream pausing and termination; this defect was substantially alleviated by an increase in its concentration. When overexpressed episomally, all of the rfaH genes complemented the disruption of the chromosomal copy of the E. coli gene. Thus, despite the apparently accelerated divergent evolution of the RfaH proteins, the mechanism of their action is conserved well enough to make them transcriptionally active in the E. coli system.
TI  - High levels of IgG class antibodies to recombinant HSP60 kDa of Yersinia enterocolitica in sera of patients with uveitis.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the levels of IgG class antibodies to recombinant heat shock protein 60 kDa of Yersinia enterocolitica (rHSP60Ye), Klebsiella pneumoniae (rHSP60Kp), Escherichia coli (rHSP60Ec), Shigella flexneri (rHSP60Sf), and Streptococcus pyogenes (rHSP60Sp) in the serum of patients with HLA-B27 associated acute anterior uveitis (HLA-B27 associated AAU), idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (idiopathic AAU), pars planitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH), and healthy subjects. METHODS: The genes that code for HSP60Ye, HSP60Kp, HSP60Ec, HSP60Sf, and HSP60Sp were cloned by PCR from genomic DNA. The rHSPs were purified by affinity using a Ni-NTA resin. The serum levels of IgG class antibodies to rHSP60s were determined by ELISA in patients with uveitis (n = 42) and in healthy subjects (n = 25). RESULTS: The majority of patients with uveitis had higher levels of IgG class antibodies to rHSP60Ye compared with levels of healthy subjects (p = 0.01), although these differences were only observed in the HLA-B27 associated AAU (p = 0.005) and in pars planitis patients (p = 0.001). The levels of IgG antibodies to the rHSP60Kp, rHSP60Sf, rHSP60Ec, and rHSP60Sp were similar in patients with uveitis and in healthy subjects (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that HSP60Ye could be involved in the aetiology of HLA-B27 associated AAU and pars planitis.
TI  - Severe bacterial infection in transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia major.
AB  - The incidence and clinical spectrum of severe bacterial infection were studied in 89 patients with thalassemia major that was diagnosed between January 1971 and March 2002. There were 20 patients with 24 episodes of severe bacterial infection, resulting in an incidence of 1.6 infections per 100 patient-years. The clinical spectrum included liver abscess (6 cases), septicemia (6 cases), soft-tissue infection (2 cases), osteomyelitis (2 cases), corneal ulcer (1 case), enteritis (1 case), and abscesses of the lung, kidney, intra-abdominal region, retropharynx, gums, and buttocks (1 case each). The leading causal microorganisms were gram-negative bacilli, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 of 20 isolates). Other responsible pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2/20), Vibrio vulnificus (2/20), Acinetobacter baumanii (1/20), Streptococcus intermidius (1/20), Yersinia enterocolitica (1/20), Staphylococcus aureus (1/20), Escherichia coli (1/20), and Salmonella species (1/20). Splenectomy and delays in the start of iron-chelating therapy were 2 independent risk factors.
TI  - Comparative immune responses to candidate arthritogenic bacteria do not confirm a dominant role for Klebsiella pneumonia in the pathogenesis of familial ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using humoral immune responses, Klebsiella pneumoniae has been implicated as a candidate microbial trigger in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) by several investigators but refuted by others. The objective of this case-control study was to compare the cellular (T-cell proliferation) and humoral (IgG and IgA, by ELISA) immune responses of affected individuals in multiplex AS families with those of unaffected family members and normal healthy controls in order to find out whether affected individuals exhibit a predominant immune response to K. pneumoniae. METHODS: Twenty-five families with two or more individuals affected with AS and 34 normal healthy controls matched with the affected family members for age, sex and ethnicity were enrolled in the study. All affected (n = 57) and unaffected (n = 37) family members had a detailed clinical evaluation. Peripheral blood was drawn to determine T-lymphocyte proliferation and the IgG and IgA (by ELISA analysis) immune responses to K. pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica and Chlamydia trachomatis. Immune responses to each of the four candidate organisms were compared in affected and unaffected individuals. Each individual was classified by the predominant antigenic immune response that they showed when comparison was made among the same concentrations of the four candidate microbial antigens. This stratification was then used (i) to compare immune responses in affected and unaffected family members and (ii) to compare clinical characteristics of affected family members. RESULTS: There was no difference in mean stimulation indices or antibody responses between affected and unaffected family members for each of the candidate organisms. In terms of predominant cellular immune responses to these organisms, there was no difference between affected and unaffected family members with respect to K. pneumoniae, C. trachomatis or Y. enterocolitica. However, a higher percentage of affected family members (25.9%) exhibited a predominant response to S. typhimurium compared with unaffected family members (5.9%, P < 0.02). In assessing antibody titres, K. pneumoniae was the predominant amongst these four organisms, but there was no difference between affected family members, unaffected family members and normal healthy controls. There was no relationship between immune responses and clinical characteristics. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of affected and unaffected family members in familial AS demonstrated no significant differences with respect to cellular or humoral immune responses to K. pneumoniae and three control microbes. In addition, K. pneumoniae did not exhibit a predominant immune response in affected individuals. Thus we find no supportive evidence to implicate a causal role for K. pneumoniae in familial AS.
TI  - IgG antibodies to enterobacteria 60 kDa heat shock proteins in the sera of HLA-B27 positive ankylosing spondylitis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association of HLA-B27 and the IgG response to the 60 kDa HSPs of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi. METHODS: IgG against the 60 kDa HSPs of enterobacteria was determined by ELISA in the sera from 49 HLA-B27+ ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients; 41 HLA-B27+ healthy relatives of AS patients and 101 HLA-B27-unrelated healthy individuals. RESULTS: HLA-B27+ patients and healthy individuals, showed significantly higher IgG antibody levels to the Klebsiella, Yersinia and Salmonella HSPs than HLA-B27- healthy controls. B27+ patients had a significantly higher response to E. coli HSP than the two other groups. IgG response anti-Shigella HSP was similar in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: There is a relationship between HLA-B27 and the response to HSPs 60 from Klebsiella, Yersinia, Escherichia and Salmonella, that may be important in the initiation of AS.
TI  - The inner-core lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic waaE gene: function and genetic distribution among some Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - To determine the function of the waaE gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  LPS of Klebsiella pneumoniae, a waaE non-polar mutant has been constructed. Data obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of LPS samples obtained from the wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waaE gene is involved in substitution of alpha-L-glycero-D-manno-heptopyranose I (L,D-HeppI) at the O-4 position by a beta-D-glucopyranose (beta-D-Glcp) residue. In addition, DNA amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waaE homologues located between the waaA and coaD genes are present in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-L,D-HeppI (K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes of unknown LPS-core structures. Complementation studies using non-polar waaE mutants prove that all the waaE homologues perform the same function. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae, Ser. marcescens and P. mirabilis non-polar waaE mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. In addition, the Ser. marcescens and P. murabilis waaE mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. All these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waaE gene independently of its origin. An easy DNA amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-D-Glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-L,D-HeppI] in the inner-core LPS of Enterobacteriaceae members with unknown LPS-core structures.
TI  - Development of an ELISA using a recombinant 41 kDa partial protein (P45N') for the detection of Riemerella anatipestifer infections in ducks.
AB  - Riemerella anatipestifer, a gram-negative bacillus, is the causative agent of duck septicemia, a disease which could incur much economic loss in the duck industry. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to facilitate early detection of R. anatipestifer infection in ducks. The antigen used was a recombinant 41 kDa N-terminal fragment (rP45N') of a newly characterized R. anatipestifer potential surface protein, P45, which was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal GST fusion protein. The rP45N'-based ELISA successfully detected P45 antibodies in the sera of 20 ducks immunized with bacterin preparations of R. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 10 15, 19 and the ATCC11845 strain. Antibodies to P45 were also detected in the sera of 25% (75/296) of White Pekin ducks which were imported into Singapore from three different farms. Successful discrimination was obtained between sera from infected ducks and that of specific-pathogen free ducks (p<0.01). The rP45N'-GST antigen did not cross-react with antibodies in sera from guinea pigs which were infected with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter freundii, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pastuerella multocida, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Serratia maccescens, Shigella sonnei and Yersinia enterocolitica. In addition, the DNA sequence encoding P45 was detected in R. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the ATCC11845 strain, suggesting that P45 is probably also universally expressed in these R. anatipestifer serotypes. Thus, the ELISA described is applicable to the detection of R. anatipestifer infection in ducks.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of citrate and acetate.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated citrate salt, acetate salt, and their combinations for antibacterial activity against a sample of common pathogens. METHODS: Bacterial suspensions were added to serial microdilutions of the salts in broth, with final cell concentrations of 10(4-5) colony-forming units per milliliter. After overnight incubation at 35 degrees C, the minimum inhibitory concentration was recorded. Bactericidal activity was screened by quantitative subcultures from the minimum inhibitory concentration dilution. RESULTS: Citrate salt was active against gram-positive species and Candida albicans but showed little activity against gram-negative species; acetate salt showed the opposite results. Their combination did not show synergism or antagonism. CONCLUSION: It may be feasible to take advantage of the different antibacterial spectra of these two agents and combine them for possible application such as food or medical preservative agents.
TI  - Multiplex PCR for detection of Enterobacteriaceae in blood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid and sensitive methods are needed to detect the small numbers of bacteria that may sometimes contaminate units of blood during collection. A multiplex 5'-nuclease TaqMan PCR assay (PE Applied Biosystems) was used to detect several bacterial species that may contaminate blood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Oligonucleotide primers were made for regions of the 16S rRNA gene conserved in four different bacterial species: Yersinia enterocolitica and Serratia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species. Two probes were designed: SL-1 detected Serratia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter species, and YE-3 detected Y. enterocolitica. RESULTS: When TaqMan PCR was performed with chromosomal DNA isolated from pure cultures of Serratia liquefaciens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter agglomerans, the limit of detection with probe SL-1 was 1 to 2 CFUs. For S. marcescens, the sensitivity was 8 CFUs. The limit of detection for Y. enterocolitica with probe YE-3 was 2 CFUs. When total chromosomal DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples spiked with different numbers of Y. enterocolitica, S. liquefaciens, E. cloacae, or K. pneumoniae bacteria, the TaqMan PCR detected 12 to 16 organisms in 1 mL of blood. CONCLUSION: The 5'-nuclease TaqMan PCR assay takes only 3 hours to perform and has the potential to detect very small numbers of bacteria.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the Klebsiella pneumoniae waa gene cluster, involved  in core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - A recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in Klebsiella pneumoniae C3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to Escherichia coli K-12. The recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coaD genes, as was found in E. coli K-12. PCR amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative K. pneumoniae strains. Partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. Complementation analysis of known waa mutants from E. coli K-12 and/or Salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the Enterobacteriaceae. K. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. Analysis of a constructed K. pneumoniae waaE deletion mutant suggests that the WaaE protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-D-Glc to the O-4 position of L-glycero-D-manno-heptose I, a feature shared by K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Molecular characterization of global regulatory RNA species that control pathogenicity factors in Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  - rsmB(Ecc) specifies a nontranslatable RNA regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. This effect of rsmB(Ecc) RNA is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of RsmA(Ecc), an RNA-binding protein of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. To determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmB(Ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing Erwinia species, we cloned the rsmB genes of E. amylovora (rsmB(Ea)) and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmB(Ehg)). We show that rsmB(Ea) in E. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, motility, and pathogenicity. In E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmB(Ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of EPS and yellow pigment as well as motility. RsmA(Ea) and RsmA(Ehg) have more than 93% identity to RsmA(Ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. The rsmB genes reverse the negative effects of RsmA(Ea), RsmA(Ehg), and RsmA(Ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. These observations and findings that rsmB(Ea) and rsmB(Ehg) RNA bind RsmA(Ecc) indicate that the rsmB effect is channeled via RsmA. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmB genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a RsmA(+) strain of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its RsmA(-) derivative. E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmB transcript that is not subject to processing. By contrast, E. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmB transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmB(Ecc). Southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmB homologs in E. carotovora, E. chrysanthemi, E. amylovora, E. herbicola, E. stewartii and E. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Y. pseudotuberculosis. A comparison of rsmB sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmB RNA.
TI  - [Diagnostic value of a novel nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of pathogens causing enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis].
AB  - A new nutrient medium for isolation and cultivation of the causative agents of enteric yersiniosis and pseudotuberculosis was found to have advantages over Endo medium in its differentiating and inhibiting properties. This medium permitted the easy differentiation of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis from Y. enterocolitica, as well as from Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. rhinoscleromatis, Hafnia, Enterobacter and Citrobacter by color; from Proteus inconstans by swarming. In addition, weakly swarming of P. vulgaris differed by their light bluish color and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, by the brilliance and size of colonies. Endo medium could be used only for differentiation of E. coli from lactose-negative Yersinia colonies, Klebsiella (by mucous growth) and, to a certain extent, all Proteus species (by swarming). The medium under test and the control medium inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast to Endo medium, the medium under test partially inhibited the growth of K. rhinoscleromatis and the swarming of P. inconstans. The new medium is now introduced into practice.
TI  - Infections in E-beta thalassemia.
AB  - Infection is a major complication and the leading cause of death in thalassemia,  especially E-beta thalassemia. The spectrum of infections in E-beta thalassemia include mild and severe infections, therapy-related infections such as Yersinia enterocolitica infection associated with desferrioxamine (DFO) therapy, and transfusion-transmitted disease, as well as unique infections such as with pythiosis. Prospective studies in Thailand indicate that patients with E-beta thalassemia had more frequent episodes of both mild and severe infections. The former included upper respiratory tract infection, acute gastroenteritis, cutaneous abscess, and gingivitis. Severe infections occurred more commonly in patients with splenectomy and included septicemia, pneumonia, biliary tract infection, salmonellosis, and urinary tract infection. Responsible organisms were Escherichia coli (26%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23%), Salmonella (15%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). Other organisms included Pseudomonas, Staphylococci, Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), and Aeromonas. Patients undergoing DFO therapy are at risk for Y. enterocolitica infection which may be localized to mesenteric nodes and tonsils or occur as a generalized form such as septicemia. Recently, we have seen a unique infection so-called vascular pythiosis. Patients usually presented with clinical features of vascular occlusion of lower limbs from ascending arteritis and thrombosis. The causative organism, Pythium insidiosum, is fungus-like, in the kingdom Stramenopila, and in the class Oomycetes. The mortality rate is high and the only effective treatment has been early amputation or possibly immunotherapy. The predisposing factors of infections in thalassemia include splenectomy, iron overload, anemia, and granulocyte dysfunctions. General management of infections in thalassemia consist of prevention, i.e., immunization with pneumococcal and hepatitis vaccines, oral penicillins especially in patients with splenectomy, removal of predisposing factors such as gallstones, iron overload, and appropriate antibiotics.
TI  - Leukocytoclastic vasculitis complicating Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia.
AB  - A 79-year old woman, with a history of hypertension, presented with clinical features of congestive heart failure, fever, a purpuric rash, and left lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. Contrast computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed features of acute diverticulitis, and blood culture was subsequently positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Histological examination of a biopsy of the rash confirmed a diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV). The bacteremia responded to intravenous amoxycillin/clavulanic acid and gentamicin and the rash subsided. This case represents the first case of LCV complicating K. pneumoniae bacteremia in the English literature. The English literature on bacteria-associated LCV is reviewed. Taking aside organisms such as Rickettsia that cause endothelial invasion, the associated bacterial species tends to be subacute or chronic pathogens e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica; or the disease process is of a subacute or chronic nature e.g. endocarditis, bronchiectesis, and cystic fibrosis, leading to prolonged exposure to pathogens that apparently cause acute pyogenic infections, such as K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Biochemical sequence analyses of GES-1, a novel class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron In52 from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae ORI-1 was isolated in 1998 in France from a rectal swab of  a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in Cayenne Hospital, Cayenne, French Guiana. This strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, pTK1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. The gene for GES-1 (Guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B, where this pI-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kDa molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to ceftazidime). GES-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located Ambler class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase GN79 from Proteus mirabilis; with YENT, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from Yersinia enterocolitica; and with L-2, a chromosome-borne class A cephalosporinase from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). However, a dendrogram analysis showed that GES-1 clustered within a class A ESBL subgroup together with ESBLs VEB-1 and PER-1. Sequencing of a 7,098-bp DNA fragment from plasmid pTK1 revealed that the GES-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named In52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an intI1 gene possessing two putative promoters, P(1) and P(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an attI1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(GES-1), aac(6')Ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrXVb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmlA4), and aadA2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacEDelta1 and sulI. The bla(GES-1) and aadA2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. This work identified the second class A ESBL gene of a non-TEM, non-SHV series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.
TI  - [Electron microscopic study of pathogenic bacteria on environmental objects].
AB  - The morphological picture of different bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus  vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica O3, Y.pseudotuberculosis 1, Y.frederiksenii, Y.intermedia, Y.kristensenii) on environmental objects was studied with the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria adhered to the surface of pieces of fodder, egg shell, cabbage leaves and form microcolonies, whose morphology was similar to colonies, grown on nutrient media. The cells produced extracellular substances, seen in SEM as integuments. These integuments were gourd to protect the population from the action of unfavorable factors.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene that codes for the Klebsiella pneumoniae GroEL-like protein associated with ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the sacroiliac joints and vertebral column of unknown aetiology, but strongly related to the presence of the HLA-B27 antigen. The participation of bacterial infections as triggering factors have also been suggested. We have associated the 60 kDa heat shock protein of Klebsiella pneumoniae (HSP60Kp) with AS since we have previously demonstrated that most of the patients have IgG antibodies and active T cells that recognize preferentially this protein, but we have not yet identified the epitopes involved in the recognition. In order to know the amino acid sequence of HSP60Kp, and to be able to analyse in the future the relevant epitopes; we amplified by PCR and cloned the gene coding for this protein into the SmaI site of pUC19. The nucleotide sequence of the gene was obtained by the Sanger method using both manual and automatic techniques. Amino acid sequence of the HSP60Kp was deduced by translating the nucleotide sequence of the gene. The antigenic analysis of this sequence was compared to the antigenic analysis of the reported sequences of Escherichia coli GroEL and Yersinia enterocolitica HSP60. Using a software to predict HLA class I motifs, the nonapeptide (KRGIDKAVL) residues 117-125 of HSP60Kp showed a much higher affinity for HLA-B27 than the similar nonapeptide of E. coli GroEL and Y. enterocolitica HSP60. The only difference between the three peptides was in position nine. This finding could explain the association of AS only with the HSP60 of Klebsiella pneumoniae. On the other hand, hydrophilicity analysis, which indicates B cell epitopes, showed three similar strongly antigenic regions in the three proteins.
TI  - Enterobacterial antibodies in Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of microbial infection in rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Sera from 39 Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 52 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 51 healthy subjects (HS) were examined for IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium and enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (capsular serotypes 31 and 43), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In patients with RA, IgA class antibodies against all bacterial strains used as the antigen were increased when compared to healthy controls. In patients with AS, significantly elevated IgA levels were observed against Campylobacter and Klebsiella K43. IgM class antibodies were less frequently elevated in RA and in AS than IgA class antibodies. In RA patients, IgG antibodies against Klebsiella K43 and Proteus were significantly increased. No differences were observed in IgG class antibodies between AS patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Increases in serum bacterial antibodies in RA and AS suggest that in both diseases stimulation of the intestinal immune system by enterobacteria may have a role. However, the question whether this phenomenon is due to increased intestinal permeability and/or represents cross reactions between different enterobacteria remains open.
TI  - DNA shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolution.
AB  - DNA shuffling is a powerful process for directed evolution, which generates diversity by recombination, combining useful mutations from individual genes. Libraries of chimaeric genes can be generated by random fragmentation of a pool of related genes, followed by reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming polymerase reaction. Template switching causes crossovers in areas of sequence homology. Our previous studies used single genes and random point mutations as the source of diversity. An alternative source of diversity is naturally occurring homologous genes, which provide 'functional diversity'. To evaluate whether natural diversity could accelerate the evolution process, we compared the efficiency of obtaining moxalactamase activity from four cephalosporinase genes evolved separately with that from a mixed pool of the four genes. A single cycle of shuffling yielded eightfold improvements from the four separately evolved genes, versus a 270- to 540-fold improvement from the four genes shuffled together, a 50-fold increase per cycle of shuffling. The best clone contained eight segments from three of the four genes as well as 33 amino-acid point mutations. Molecular breeding by shuffling can efficiently mix sequences from different species, unlike traditional breeding techniques. The power of family shuffling may arise from sparse sampling of a larger portion of sequence space.
TI  - RfaH and the ops element, components of a novel system controlling bacterial transcription elongation.
AB  - The RfaH protein controls the transcription of a specialized group of Escherichia coli and Salmonella operons that direct the synthesis, assembly and export of the lipopolysaccharide core, exopolysaccharide, F conjugation pilus and haemolysin toxin. RfaH is a specific regulator of transcript elongation; its loss increases transcription polarity in these operons without affecting initiation from the operon promoters. The operons of the RfaH-dependent regulon contain a short conserved 5' sequence, the ops element, deletion of which increases operon polarity to an extent similar to that caused by loss of RfaH. The ops element is also present upstream of polysaccharide gene clusters of Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the RP4 fertility operon of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting that this is a widely spread control system. The mechanistic coupling of RfaH and the ops element has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, and we suggest that the ops element recruits RfaH and potentially other factors to the RNA polymerase complex, modifying the complex to increase its processivity and allowing transcription to proceed over long distances.
TI  - Nested polymerase chain reaction strategy simultaneously targeting DNA sequences  of multiple bacterial species in inflammatory joint diseases. II. Examination of sacroiliac and knee joint biopsies of patients with spondyloarthropathies and other arthritides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play a crucial pathogenetic role in reactive arthritis (ReA)  and other forms of spondyloarthropathy (SpA) and in Lyme arthritis. Although there is evidence of local persistence of bacterial antigens no definitive method revealing microbes in peripheral joints has been established. We detected DNA of individual bacteria in synovial material by PCR. Applying molecular technology we screened simultaneously for 8 bacterial genomes in arthritis and sacroiliitis. METHODS: Sacroiliac (SI) biopsy specimens taken from the SI joint of 8 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS, n = 5) and undifferentiated SpA (uSpA, n = 3) by computed tomography guided biopsy were investigated for presence of bacterial DNA. Similarly, synovial membrane samples obtained by office arthroscopy from 15 patients with ReA (n = 5), uSpA (n = 3), undifferentiated oligoarthritis (uOligo, n = 3), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 4) were screened. Nested PCR was performed for DNA of the following bacteria: Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Borrelia burgdorferi. RESULTS: No bacterial DNA was found in the SI biopsies of patients with uSpA and AS. DNA of B. burgdorferi (n = 2) and C. trachomatis (n = 1) was detected in 3 patients with uOligo, but not in patients with ReA or RA. DNA of other microbes including K. pneumoniae was not found. Patients' mean disease duration was 5.3 years (2 mo-8.4 yrs). CONCLUSION: We found bacterial DNA in peripheral joints of patients with uOligo, while in patients with ReA, AS, and uSpA no bacterial DNA was detected in peripheral or SI joints. The failure to detect bacterial DNA in patients with SpA suggests autoimmune mechanisms operate in later stages of disease.
TI  - Nested polymerase chain reaction strategy simultaneously targeting DNA sequences  of multiple bacterial species in inflammatory joint diseases. I. Screening of synovial fluid samples of patients with spondyloarthropathies and other arthritides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play a crucial pathogenetic role in Lyme arthritis (LA), reactive arthritis (ReA), other forms of spondyloarthropathy (SpA), and possibly in undifferentiated oligoarthritis (uOligo). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has been applied to detect bacterial DNA of individual microbes in synovial fluid (SF) of patients with arthritides. We screened for DNA sequences of 8 bacterial species simultaneously in SF of patients with inflammatory joint disease. METHODS: We examined 104 SF samples of 96 patients with ReA (n = 13), undifferentiated SpA (uSpA, n = 10), uOligo (n = 50), juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA, n = 13), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 10). A nested PCR approach was developed to detect DNA sequences of 8 bacteria: Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Borrelia burgdorferi. The detection limit was determined at 10 bacterial/sample. Serology and lymphocyte proliferation assay were done in parallel in most patients. RESULTS: In 12 cases bacterial DNA of B. burgdorferi (n = 7), C. trachomatis (n = 2), C. jejuni (n = 2), and C. pneumoniae (n = 1) was detected in patients with uOligo (n = 9) and JCA (n = 3), while no evidence of bacterial DNA was found in patients with ReA, uSpA, and RA. Shigella flexneri DNA was detected in 4 cases, but the significance of this finding remains uncertain due to the high sequence homology of this species with Escherichia coli. DNA of Y. enterocolitica, S. enteritidis, or K. pneumoniae was not found. A positive serologic response was found in 7/9 PCR positive patients. In 11/96 cases antibodies to 2 or more bacteria were found in parallel (11.5%). Antigen specific lymphocyte proliferation was observed in 5/9 PCR positive patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial DNA was detected in peripheral joint of patients with uOligo and JCA, but not in ReA, uSpA, or RA in this study. The detection of bacterial DNA in synovial material by PCR technology gives useful diagnostic information, especially when antibodies against several microbes are present or antibodies are not detectable. Failure to detect bacterial DNA in patients with ReA and uSpA with longstanding disease suggests that in later stages autoimmune mechanisms may operate.
TI  - A bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Morganella morganii at low pH.
AB  - To infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach. In this study, we showed that Y. enterocolitica serotype O8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as pH 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. Acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-pH conditions. Acid tolerance of Helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was not specifically activated by low-pH conditions. A ure mutant strain of Y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea was the sole nitrogen source. Examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that Morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but Escherichia coli 1021, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. Consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases were activated in vitro by low pH with an unusually low activity optimum of pH 5.5. In whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below pH 3.0 for Y. enterocolitica and pH 5.5 for M. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. DNA sequence analysis of portions of the M. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of Y. enterocolitica urease. One region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of Lactobacillus fermentum. This region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the Y. enterocolitica and M. morganii ureases since the L. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low pH optimum for activity.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Comparison of the antibody responses to the 77 Klebsiella capsular types in ankylosing spondylitis and various rheumatic diseases.
AB  - The production of antibodies to Klebsiella capsular polysaccharides was measured  in sera from either HLA-B27-positive (HLA-B27+) or HLA-B27-negative (HLA-B27-) patients with classical ankylosing spondylitis (n = 54). These sera were compared with sera from patients with various rheumatic diseases (n = 82) and HLA-B27+ or HLA-B27- healthy individuals (n = 85). All sera were analyzed by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific to each of the 77 Klebsiella serotypes. The sera from HLA-B27+ patients with ankylosing spondylitis showed a significantly higher antibody frequency to the capsular types K26, K36, and K50 than the sera from HLA-B27- ankylosing spondylitis patients, patients with psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or reactive arthritis after Yersinia enterocolitica infection, or healthy controls (P < 0.02). The antibodies were of the immunoglobulin G type. No significant antibody response to the other 74 Klebsiella serotypes, noncapsulated mutants of K26, K36, and K50, or preparations of Citrobacter, Serratia, Hafnia, or Morganella spp. or Streptococcus pneumoniae could be detected. The results might suggest a specific association between these capsular types and HLA-B27+ ankylosing spondylitis and might imply their predominance in this disease.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - A new class of proteins regulating gene expression in enterobacteria.
AB  - YmoA and Hha are highly similar bacterial proteins downregulating gene expression in Yersinia enterocolitica and Escherichia coli, respectively. The phenotype of ymoA mutants evokes that of mutants affected in some histone-like proteins. This paper describes complementation of a ymoA mutation in Y. enterocolitica by the hha gene from E. coli. We show that YmoA and Hha are not only very similar proteins but that they are functionally interchangeable. Genetic experiments indicate that Hha can also stimulate transposition events in vivo. By Southern blot analysis we detected hha-homologous genes at least in Citrobacter diversus, Shigella flexneri, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. We suggest that both YmoA and Hha belong to a new family of proteins downregulating gene expression in different enterobacteria.
TI  - Bacterial antibodies in HLA-B27+ healthy individuals.

TI  - Phylogenetic tree and sequence similarity of beta-lactamases.
AB  - beta-Lactamases are the main cause of beta-lactam resistance in many pathogenic bacteria. These enzymes can be detected in a variety of pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria. The cyanobacteria are also known to produce a beta-lactamase. Recently, the amino acid sequences and the three-dimensional structures of some of these beta-lactamases have been clarified. On the basis of the amino acid sequences of 47 beta-lactamases and the computer-aided analysis, a phylogenetic tree is proposed in this paper. According to the tree, beta-lactamases are classified into six groups. Group 1 beta-lactamases are mainly composed of plasmid-mediated enzymes from gram-negative bacteria. However, chromosome-derived beta-lactamases from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Rhodopseudomonas capsulata take part in this group. Group 2 enzymes consist of a part of the chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from Streptomyces, and chromosome-mediated enzymes from Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter diversus, and Klebsiella oxytoca. Chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from gram-negative bacteria form group 3. Group 4 is composed of metalloenzymes, whereas group 5 consists of OXA type beta-lactamases. Chromosome-encoded beta-lactamases from gram-positive bacteria form group 6. Comparison of the amino acid sequences among these groups confirmed the phylogenetic tree and the classification: the beta-lactamases in each group have its particular conserved amino acid sequences. In addition, the tree provides more detailed classification and time-scale mutual relationships and predicts new types of beta-lactamases that may be found. Furthermore, the classification deduced from the tree is generally in accord with the one based on the amino acid sequences reported previously. However, the class A beta-lactamases are clearly divided into three groups: groups 1, 2, and 6. RDF2 analysis shows that some combinations between beta-lactamases and beta-lactam-interacting proteins as well as eukaryotic proteins have a low but significant evolutionary relatedness.
TI  - Biogenesis and regulation of the Vibrio cholerae toxin-coregulated pilus: analogies to other virulence factor secretory systems.
AB  - Biogenesis of the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) of Vibrio cholerae 01 is essential for successful bacterial colonization of the small intestine. Pilus assembly requires the products of at least seven genes located on the chromosome adjacent to the pilin-encoding gene, tcpA. Previously reported TnphoA insertions in the TCP-assembly-deficient V. cholerae strains, KP2.21 and KP4.2, were isolated from the chromosome for further analysis. Nucleotide sequencing of the tcpE::phoA and tcpF::phoA fusions and corresponding clones of the region containing the intact genes revealed the presence of two open reading frames (ORFs) of 340 and 338 amino acids, designated TcpE and TcpF, respectively. The partial sequence of an ORF downstream from the TcpF coding sequence was determined to correspond to the global virulence regulator, ToxT. Proteins corresponding to the observed ORFs were visualized with the T7 promoter/RNA polymerase expression system. Computer-generated alignment algorithms predict that a homology exists between TcpE and the Klebsiella pneumoniae pullulanase secretion proteins PulD and PulF, the Xanthomonas campestris extracellular enzyme secretion factor XpsF, the Bacillus subtilis DNA competence protein ComG-ORF2, and the Yersinia enterocolitica Yop secretion determinant YscC. These observations provide a model to investigate further the relationship between the secretion mechanisms utilized by these seemingly diverse virulence determinants. Additionally, an extreme C-terminal segment of TcpE shows striking homology to the transmembrane segment of the eukaryotic integrin beta-1 chain, which could imply a role for TcpE in not only TCP secretion, but also host cell interaction.
TI  - MxiD, an outer membrane protein necessary for the secretion of the Shigella flexneri lpa invasins.
AB  - The invasive phenotype of Shigella flexneri is conferred by a 220 kb virulence plasmid, pWR100, that encodes both the lpa proteins, which are involved in the entry process, and factors which are required for the export and correct localization of the lpa proteins. We have characterized the mxiD gene, whose expression, like that of the ipa operon, is regulated by temperature. After inactivation of mxiD, the mutant strain was unable to invade HeLa cells and to provoke keratoconjunctivitis in guinea-pigs. Analysis of culture supernatants indicated that wild-type S. flexneri secretes about nine polypeptides and that secretion of several of these, including lpaA, lpaB, and lpaC, is abolished in the mxiD mutant. Examination of the membrane proteins of the wild-type and mxiD strains suggested that MxiD is an outer membrane protein. Amino acid sequence comparison revealed that MxiD is homologous to the YscC protein of Yersinia enterocolitica and to the C-terminal region of the PulD protein of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both YscC and PulD are involved in extracellular protein secretion. These results indicate that MxiD is an essential component of the lpa secretion apparatus.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Molecular mimickry between HLA B27 and Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella and Klebsiella within the same region of HLA alpha 1-helix.
AB  - Two new examples of amino acid homology between HLA B27 and microbes triggering HLA B27-associated diseases are described. An outer membrane protein YadA (Yersinia adhesin, previously called Yop1) of Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis shares a linear tetrapeptide with HLA B27. A cationic outer membrane protein OmpH of Salmonella typhimurium shares homology with five amino acids of HLA B27 in a non-linear fashion. The four amino acids of YadA are also notably included in the hexapeptide identical between Klebsiella pneumoniae nitrogenase and HLA B27, and three of them occur in the pentapeptide shared by a Shigella flexneri protein and HLA B27. Antibodies against synthetic peptides including HLA B27 homologues sequences of YadA and OmpH were observed in one-third of the patients with HLA B27 associated diseases. Antibodies were directed against a flanking sequence next to the amino acid sequences shared by arthritis-triggering microbes and HLA B27. The area of identity in each example of this molecular mimicry (Yersinia, Salmonella, Shigella and Klebsiella) is located in the same place on the HLA B27 molecule: between amino acids 70 to 78 in the variable region of alpha 1-helix. This area of HLA B27 molecule includes sites predicted to be important for binding processed antigens.
TI  - Analysis of virC, an operon involved in the secretion of Yop proteins by Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - Upon incubation at 37 degrees C in the absence of Ca2+ ions, pathogenic yersiniae release large amounts of pYV plasmid-encoded proteins called Yops that are involved in pathogenesis. Yersinia enterocolitica also expresses an outer membrane protein that is considered an adhesin and called YadA (previously called P1 or YopA). The production of Yops is coordinately regulated by a 20-kb region of the plasmid referred to as the Ca2+ dependence region and containing at least four loci called virA, virB, virC, and virF. The virF gene encodes a key transcriptional activator of yop genes. We have shown here that virF is also required for transcription of yadA and that virB is necessary for full transcription of the yop and yadA genes. In contrast, mutations in genes virA and virC had only a weak influence on the transcription of yop and yadA genes. These mutations did not affect the production of YadA but they completely inhibited the translocation of Yops from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular milieu. We inferred from these data that virA and virC are involved in the specific transport of Yops. We analyzed the 8.5-kb virC region and showed that it is most probably a single operon containing 13 open reading frames called yscA to yscM (for Yop secretion). Protein YscC has a putative signal sequence and shares significant homology with outer membrane proteins involved in the secretion of pullulanase by Klebsiella pneumoniae (PulD) or in the assembly of filamentous bacteriophages (gene IV product). At least the putative products of yscD, yscJ, and yscL were shown to be required for the export of Yops. YscJ turned out to be YlpB, a lipoprotein that we had detected previously. The yscM gene shares homology with yopH, the adjacent gene on the pYV plasmid. Its product does not appear to be necessary for the production of Yops. Transcription of the virC operon was subjected to the same regulation as the yop genes.
TI  - Production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody (MAb 4E8C12) specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7 and O26:H11 was produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a rough strain of E. coli O157:H7. The antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of E. coli O157:H7. No cross-reactivity was observed with strains of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus spp., Escherichia hermanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of E. coli other than serotype O157:H7 (including strains of serotype O157 but not H7). The E. coli strains (all of serotype O26:H11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of E. coli O157:H7. MAb 4E8C12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin G2a and has a kappa light chain. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of E. coli of different serotypes followed by Western immunoblot analysis revealed that MAb 4E8C12 reacted specifically with two proteins of EHEC strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. These proteins appeared to be markers specific for EHEC strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11. This MAb, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of EHEC isolates in clinical and food specimens.
TI  - [Immune disorders and sensitization to microbial antigens in seronegative spondylitis].
AB  - A study was made of immunity in seronegative spondylarthritis. In ankylosing spondylarthritis, reactive arthritides and psoriatic arthritis, the decrease of T cells, T helpers and T suppressors was identified. Patients with ankylosing spondylarthritis and reactive arthritides manifested an increase of the B-lymphocyte count. Patients with ankylosing spondylarthritis were demonstrated to be sensitive to Klebsiella (52%), those with reactive arthritides to intestinal yersinia (44%). The phenotype of antigen-binding cells was examined. Of these, 39% appeared to be T lymphocytes, 29% B lymphocytes. The presence of Fc receptors in an appreciable portion of those cells suggests their functional maturity. The inhibition test demonstrated the participation of HLA-B27 in reception of Klebsiella antigens in ankylosing spondylarthritis.
TI  - [Value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  - Reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Shigella and Salmonella. Intestinal infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Cryptosporidium, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia saginata and Schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis. Detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. A large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. It is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. The detection of serum antibodies to Y. enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, C. jejuni/coli, and Schistosoma may suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - Purification of cross-reacting protein antigen shared by Yersinia enterocolitica  and other gram-negative bacteria with monoclonal antibody.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody against the Yersinia enterocolitica 60-kilodalton (kDa) antigen, designated cross-reacting protein antigen (CRPA), was obtained by cell fusion. The CRPA common to gram-negative bacteria was purified from Y. enterocolitica by the affinity chromatography with the monoclonal antibody (IgG1) thus obtained. The purified CRPA showed a single band of 60 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and reacted with rabbit antisera against Y. enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei in Western blot analysis. The monoclonal antibody, however, reacted with a 60 kDa peptide from Y. enterocolitica, but not with the antigens from other gram-negative bacteria such as V. cholerae, E. coli, S. sonnei, Salmonella enteritidis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. The results suggested that both species-specific and cross-reactive epitopes were present on a CRPA molecule.
TI  - Polyclonal B-cell activation by bacteria that induce nonsuppurative sequelae.
AB  - The polyclonal B cell activation (PBA) process induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae K34 (klebs) and Yersinia enterocolitica 03 (yers) was investigated. Both heat-inactivated bacteria and their cell wall biostructures (klebsM, muriene, protein I etc.) stimulate human blood B cells to differentiate into immunoglobulin-secreting cells without prior proliferation and without T cells. Klebs-activated B cells secrete mainly IgM and to a lesser degree IgG (mainly IgG2). The PBA process was regulated by CD4+ cells and monocytes, but not by CD8+ cells. While interleukin 2 is able both to induce proliferation and to enhance differentiation in klebs-activated B cell cultures, the low-molecular-weight B cell growth factor (BCGF) did not lead to a significant amount of 3H-thymidine uptake. In addition, in klebs-activated B cell cultures various anti-polynucleotide autoantibodies and the 16/6 idiotype were detectable. Thus, bacteria that induce nonsuppurative sequelae (e.g. klebs, yers) can use several mechanisms to overcome tolerance in their host.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
TI  - Morphological differentiation of human lymphocyte subpopulations following polyclonal stimulation with bacteria and lectin.
AB  - Mononuclear cells (MNC) were stimulated with different heat-treated gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and the lymphocyte subpopulation interaction, the proliferative response, and the immunoglobulin secretion were analyzed. It can be demonstrated that beta haemolytic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus have a similar stimulation pattern: early stimulation of helper T cells, cell contacts of helper T cells and B cells, maximum proliferation on day 5 and 7, and Ig secretion peak on day 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia enterocolitica do not cause proliferation, while Ig secretion is seen on day 5. No cell contacts and no T cell stimulation are seen in the Klebsiella culture, whilst Yersinia causes slight helper T cell activation. In contrast, PHA induces strong T cell stimulation, proliferation and expansion of the suppressor T cell subpopulation. Leu 7-positive lymphocytes are not activated by any of these stimulants.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria by Purogene.
AB  - The bacteriocidal efficacy of Purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. The organisms tested were: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The test organisms responded differently to inactivation by Purogene. At least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when Purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. Since Purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of ClO2 in this solution. This was done by varying the pH of Purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (pH of Purogene is 8.6) while keeping the pH of the experimental medium constant (pH 7.0). The results showed that Purogene was most efficacious at the lowest pH tested (pH 3.5). This indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at pH 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide as the active disinfecting species.
TI  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  - Tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. At less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. At less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Branhamella catarrhalis. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp. or Acinetobacter spp. Tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Some Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. The MIC for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, and C and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for 90% of enterococci, Listeria spp., Bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter, Morganella, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides spp. Tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. The growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Serological studies in Crohn's disease.
AB  - ELISA and immunofluorescence tests were carried out on sera from patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The results indicate that mean antibody levels to Yersinia enterocolitica types O:9 and O:3 and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but not Pseudomonas maltophilia, are significantly higher in these patients than in control subjects. There are differing antibody levels in ileal and colonic disease, and there is a significant fall in antibody levels 9-12 months after remission from clinical symptoms in patients providing serial serum samples. However, there is no correlation between the severity of the disease and antibody titres.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new monobactam, B0-1165.
AB  - B0-1165 is a 1-carboxy-1-cyclopropoxyamino,4-fluoromethyl monobactam. It inhibited the majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Salmonella and Shigella species at less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml. Overall, its in vitro activity was similar to that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime, with minor differences in the MICs for individual isolates. Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii which were derepressed for beta-lactamase production and had higher MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime had MICs that ranged from 4 to 32 micrograms/ml. B0-1165 had activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of aztreonam but lower than that of ceftazidime and carumonam. Pseudomonas maltophilia and other Pseudomonas species were resistant or had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, as did Acinetobacter species. B0-1165 did not inhibit streptococcal, staphylococcal, or anaerobic species, such as Clostridium and Bacteroides species. B0-1165 was not hydrolyzed to any appreciable extent by common plasmid- and chromosomally Richmond-Sykes type 1a-, 1c-, and 1d-mediated beta-lactamases. It inhibited the Enterobacter cloacae P99 and inducible Pseudomonas aeruginosa beta-lactamases. B0-1165 was a poor inducer of beta-lactamase, but exposing E. cloacae and C. freundii to B0-1165 selected for resistant isolates. Overall, B0-1165 had in vitro properties similar to those of other monobactams currently available or under investigation.
TI  - Serum IgA to enterobacteria in ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - The aetiology of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) may involve certain enterobacteria.  It is therefore interesting that serum polymeric IgA, a precursor of secretory IgA, was statistically elevated in active AS (n = 35) and that levels were comparable to those found in yersiniosis (n = 12); this might indicate antigenic stimulation by bacteria which are present in the intestines of AS patients. However, specific serum IgA to the incriminated enterobacteria Klebsiella, Shigella and Yersinia, as determined by ELISA, was not raised in the above AS patients. Nor were these titres raised in patients with idiopathic reactive arthritis (n = 21). In contrast, yersiniosis (n = 12) and shigellosis (n = 96) patients displayed marked increases in specific serum IgA titres to the respective infectants. It is proposed that AS may involve a set of enterobacteria rather than a few suspected species. Thus, despite the lack of raised group averages, screening of individual patients for specific IgA to several indicated bacteria might disclose whether or not raised serum IgA is related to enterobacterial activity. Apart from this, the above supports other reports indicating that serum IgA may be a useful parameter to assist in monitoring of disease activity in AS. Finally, it is suggested that study of a homogeneous group of reactive arthritis patients might facilitate aetiological research of seronegative arthropathies such as AS.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  - The antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. The presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. These included ticarcillin-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis. In addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Hemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. Clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. The bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). In these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. The protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.
TI  - Pathogenesis of Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis: immunological, microbiological and clinical aspects.
AB  - When a patient develops reactive arthritis after Yersinia enteritis, the following conditions are often fulfilled: the patient is HLA-B27-positive; however, some B27-negative individuals develop severe arthritis and some positives do not, in the initial phase, the diarrhea is milder, the anti-Yersinia antibody response of IgG class is more vigorous and persists longer, the anti-Yersinia antibody response of IgA class is more vigorous and persists much longer, the anti-Yersinia antibodies of IgA1 and IgA2 subclass, those with J-chain and, especially, those with secretory piece are produced more vigorously, indicating local immunostimulation close to the intestinal epithelium, in the early phase, Yersinia-IgM immune complexes are found in the circulation, and the lymphocyte transformation response against not only Yersinia but also against other gram-negative enteric bacteria is weaker. When all these aspects are considered together a strong suspicion arises that the patients who are destined to develop reactive arthritis fail in their first line of defense against the invading organism when contracting a Yersinia enteritis. This may lead to persistence of the microorganism within the body, e.g., in the intestinal epithelium or in the mesenteric lymphoid tissues, maintaining a stimulus for a prolonged--apparently futile and perhaps harmful--antibody production. Finally, the initiating and decisive factor should not be forgotten: the Yersinia. Why and how it triggers the process is at present one of the enigmas of the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis.
TI  - HLA-B27 and clinical aspects of ankylosing spondylitis: results of prospective studies.
AB  
TI  - Specific cell-mediated responses to bacterial antigens and clinical correlations  in reactive arthritis, Reiter's syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - In 2 cases of ReA seen during the acute phase and shown serologically to be due to Y. enterocolitica 0:3, the LT test showed a marked response using as antigen a freeze dried preparation of the causative organism. The test result correlated with the activity of the disease when repeated during a flare in the 1st case, and during remission in both. Patients with ReA/RS in general showed a significantly higher response to the yersinia and klebsiella antigens tested when compared to AS, suggesting an overall difference in cell-mediated immunity to these enteric bacteria. AS cases reacted significantly less than controls to K. pneumoniae under suboptimal conditions. K. pneumoniae was shown to enhance the LT response to yersinia, possibly through an adjuvant effect. This was found with AS, ReA and in controls, though whether it is of relevance in the etiopathogenesis of AS or ReA/RS remains far from clear. Acute non-traumatic synovitis of the knee, occurring de novo, or in association with psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, or as part of RS, may be accompanied by evidence of heightened reactivity to streptococci both by blood and synovial fluid mononuclear cells. In 1 case with serological evidence of streptococcal infection and erythema nodosum, these changes were found to parallel disease activity. ReA can, it appears, follow recent streptococcal infection, and be associated with B27.
TI  - A heat-modifiable outer membrane protein carries an antigen specific for the species Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
AB  - The outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria are considered to be of importance  in host-bacteria interaction, in protective immunity, and occasionally in subclassification within a species. In this study, the outer membranes of several strains of Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). It was found that the appearance of the major proteins depended on the temperature at which they were solubilized in SDS. A protein was identified with the use of two-dimensional gels and preparative SDS-PAGE, which was equivalent to the "heat-modifiable protein" (protein II) of other Enterobacteriaceae species. A monoclonal antibody, 4G1, was generated against an isolated preparation of this Y. enterocolitica protein. This antibody was tested with whole cell bacterial antigens of 46 individual bacterial strains. The reactive strains included only Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. In addition, the reactivity of the 4G1 monoclonal antibody preparation could be absorbed only with Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis, and not with other strains of bacteria. The reactivity of this 4G1 monoclonal antibody was also tested by the Western Blot technique. Six individual strains were tested: a Y. enterocolitica serotype 0:3, a Y. enterocolitica serotype 0:9, an Escherichia coli, a Salmonella typhimurium, a Shigella flexneri, and a Klebsiella pneumoniae. The 4G1 antibody reacted with only the proteins of the two Y. enterocolitica strains. In conclusion, the equivalent of the heat-modifiable protein was present in Y. enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Moreover, this protein also carried a species-specific antigenic determinant.
TI  - Lymphocyte proliferative responses to bacterial antigens in B27-associated arthropathies.
AB  - Lymphocyte transformation tests to Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:6, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis antigens have been carried out in ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis/Reiter's disease and controls. Ankylosing spondylitis cases gave significantly lower responses than reactive arthritis/Reiter's to Yersinia enterocolitica 0:6 (p = 0.003) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.008), and less than controls to S. faecalis (p = 0.008). It appears, therefore, that within the B27 arthritis population there is heterogeneity of cell-mediated response to certain enteric bacteria, with the hyporesponders manifesting ankylosing spondylitis and the hyper-responders reactive arthritis/Reiter's disease.
TI  - Susceptibility of chemostat-grown Yersinia enterocolitica and Klebsiella pneumoniae to chlorine dioxide.
AB  - The resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents could be influenced by growth  environment. The susceptibility of two enteric bacteria, Yersinia enterocolitica and Klebsiella pneumoniae, to chlorine dioxide was investigated. These organisms were grown in a defined medium in a chemostat and the influence of growth rate, temperature, and cell density on the susceptibility was studied. All inactivation experiments were conducted with a dose of 0.25 mg of chlorine dioxide per liter in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.0 and 23 degrees C. The results indicated that populations grown under conditions that more closely approximate natural aquatic environments, e.g., low temperatures and growth at submaximal rates caused by nutrient limitation, were most resistant. The conclusion from this study is that antecedent growth conditions have a profound effect on the susceptibility of bacteria to disinfectants, and it is more appropriate to use the chemostat-grown bacteria as test organisms to evaluate the efficacy of a certain disinfectant.
TI  - Toxins which activate guanylate cyclase: heat-stable enterotoxins.
AB  - Certain enteropathogenic bacteria, including strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia enterocolitica, elicit their diarrhoeagenic effects by elaborating small molecular weight, heat-stable enterotoxins (STs). Structural and functional characteristics indicate that ST peptides are heterogeneous and two major subtypes, STa and STb, have been identified. Molecules of STa, unlike those of STb, are methanol-soluble and elicit their pathogenic effects by activating host cell guanylate cyclase activity and thereby increasing tissue cyclic GMP content: this increase in cyclic GMP causes fluid secretion. STa binds to specific proteinaceous receptors on intestinal cells but the nature of STa-receptor coupling to guanylate cyclase is poorly understood. The actions of STa, including binding to its receptor, activation of guanylate cyclase and stimulation of electrolyte transport, are rapid, reversible and tissue-specific. STa activates only particulate and not soluble guanylate cyclase. It alters the Vmax but not the apparent Km of this enzyme for Mg-GTP or Mn-GTP. At concentrations above 0.5-1 mM, calcium inhibits the STa activation of guanylate cyclase. The effects of calmodulin antagonists such as chlorpromazine on the activation of guanylate cyclase by STa are less clear. Inhibitors of phospholipid and arachidonic acid cascade pathways interfere with both basal and STa-stimulated guanylate cyclase. Membrane integrity is essential for STa activation of guanylate cyclase and the STa-receptor complex may activate the enzyme by intramembrane protein-protein interactions and/or perturbations. Interference with membrane phospholipid could alter such coupling.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
TI  - Identification of HLA-B27M1 and -M2 cross-reactive antigens in Klebsiella, Shigella and Yersinia.
AB  
TI  - Bacteria associated with crabs from cold waters with emphasis on the occurrence of potential human pathogens.
AB  - A diverse array of bacterial species, including several potential human pathogens, was isolated from edible crabs collected in cold waters. Crabs collected near Kodiak Island, Alaska, contained higher levels of bacteria than crabs collected away from regions of human habitation. The bacteria associated with the crabs collected near Kodiak included Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species; the pathogenicity of these isolates was demonstrated in mice. Although coliforms were not found, the bacterial species associated with the tissues of crabs collected near Kodiak indicate possible fecal contamination that may have occurred through contact with sewage. Compared with surrounding waters and sediments, the crab tissues contained much higher proportions of gram-positive cocci. As revealed by indirect plate counts and direct scanning electron microscopic observations, muscle and hemolymph tissues contained much lower levels of bacteria than shell and gill tissues. After the death of a crab, however, the numbers of bacteria associated with hemolymph and muscle tissues increased significantly. Microcosm studies showed that certain bacterial populations, e.g., Vibrio cholerae, can be bioaccumulated in crab gill tissues. The results of this study indicate the need for careful review of waste disposal practices where edible crabs may be contaminated with microorganisms that are potential human pathogens and the need for surveillance of shellfish for pathogenic microorganisms that naturally occur in marine ecosystems.
TI  - HLA-B27 and the immune response to enterobacterial antigens in ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Total serum immunoglobulins and class specific serum antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were measured in 107 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 110 healthy tissue typed controls by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The specificity of this technique was confirmed by the use of specific bacterial murine antisera and by cross-absorption of human sera by specific bacteria. Total serum IgA in AS patients correlated with both erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P less than 0.001) and C-reactive protein (P less than 0.05) and was significantly elevated compared to healthy individuals (P less than 0.001). A significant elevation of IgA antibodies to K. pneumoniae was detected in the serum of AS patients with active disease when compared to healthy controls (P less than 0.01). These studies support the involvement of an enterobacterial micro-organism in the pathogenesis of AS and further relate to the role of HLA-B27 in this disease.
TI  - In vitro lymphoproliferative response to Yersinia: depressed response in arthritic patients years after Yersinia infection.
AB  - The persistence of lymphocyte transformation response to Yersinia was studied three to six years after Yersinia infection in subjects who had or had not suffered from reactive arthritis. In persons who had had arthritis, significantly weaker response to Yersinia was found than in those who had recovered without developing arthritis. The same held true also for the response to Klebsiella. These results support and extend our earlier observations of a depressed lymphocyte transformation response to Yersinia during the course of Yersinia arthritis. This phenomenon may be linked to the individual's susceptibility to arthritic complications after Yersinia infection.
TI  - Comparison of two methods for same-day identification of Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Two commercial methods, API 20E (as modified for same-day enterobacterial identification) and Micro-ID, were evaluated for ability to provide useful same-day information of 368 clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae. Organisms included Escherichia coli (54), Shigella (7), Edwardsiella tarda (1), Salmonella enteritidis (10), Citrobacter (30), Klebsiella (55), Enterobacter (68), Hafnia alvei (2), Serratia (33), Proteus (64), Morganella morganii (24), Providencia (18), and Yersinia enterocolitica (2). Methods were those of manufacturers without supplemental tests. API at five hours identified 78.5% of strains to species, 9.5% to genus only, 10.1% as part of a spectrum of identifications (SI), and 1.9% incorrect. Micro-ID at four hours yielded 90.0% correct identification to species and 3.3% to genus only, 4.0% SI, and 2.7% incorrect. API identification of many Serratia, Citrobacter, Providencia strains was to genus only; most incorrect results occurred in Serratia marcescens. Micro-ID identified most organisms to species; incorrect identifications were mainly S. marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both systems provided excellent identification of E. coli. Both methods sacrifice a degree of accuracy that varies with the species tested, as compared to overnight systems, but both provide rapid information of potential clinical value.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - The activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for H. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. Cefotaxime was the most active agent against H. influenzae; it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. It was also the most active agent against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid Salmonella species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Cefotaxime was among the most active agents against Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter species, Shigella species, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. None of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.
TI  - Rapid isolation of Yersinia spp. from feces.
AB  - Direct plating or cold enrichment or both have been used to isolate Yersinia spp. from feces. Freeze-shock double enrichment and KOH treatment have been recommended for recovery of Yersinia enterocolitica from surface waters and food, respectively. These techniques were evaluated as alternatives for rapid recovery of Yersinia spp. from feces. Stool samples were homogenized in buffered saline and autoclaved. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were each added to the suspension at a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. Yersinia cells were then added to a final concentration of 1.5 x 10(3), 1.5 x 10(4), 1.5 x 10(5), or 1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml. A total of 21 strains of Y. enterocolitica, 2 of Yersinia kristensenii, and 1 each of Yersinia intermedia and Yersinia fredriksenii were tested. For freeze-shock double enrichment, seeded stool samples were frozen overnight (-70 degrees C), transferred successively to m-tetrathionate broth (6 h. 37 degrees C) and selenite broth (2 h 37 degrees C), and plated on MacConkey, salmonella-shigella, and cellobiose-arginine-lysine agars for quantitation. For KOH treatment, seeded stool samples were mixed with 0.5% KOH at a ratio of 1:2 for 2 min and plated as described above. E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa were virtually eliminated after either method was used. All Yersinia strains were recovered after KOH treatment even at the lowest initial concentration (1.5 x 10(3) colony-forming units per ml). However, after freeze-shock double enrichment, not all strains were retrievable, and those isolates which were recovered were grown only from samples containing the highest number of Yersinia strains (1.5 x 10(6) colony-forming units per ml). KOH treatment of stool samples seems to be a viable substitute for more protracted methods of recovering Yersinia spp.
TI  - [Utilization and fermentation of 2-ketogluconate by "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Two methods were compared: 1) the ability to use 2-ketogluconate (2-KG) as source of carbon and energy in defined medium, and 2) the ability to produce acid by fermentation of 2-KG (0.5 g/100 ml) in peptone water with phenol red. Results of growth on, and acid production from, 2-KG were identical. A total of 990 strains was studied. No strain of Escherichia coli, Shigella (4 species), Salmonella (4 sub-genera), Yersinia pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Edwardsiella (2 species), Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, Providencia (2 species) could utilize 2-KG. All strains of Citrobacter (2 species), Levinea amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter (5 species), Serratia (6 species) utilize 2-KG as sole carbon source. Different reactions were given by strains of P. rettgeri, Y. enterocolitica and K. rhinoscleromatis.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
TI  - Ankylosing spondylitis, HLA-B27 and Klebsiella. I. Cross-reactivity studies with  rabbit antisera.
AB  - Sera from rabbits immunized with HLA-B27 lymphocytes showed increased activity against klebsiellal enterobacter antigens using immunodiffusion, bacterial agglutination (P less than 0.025), haemagglutination (P less than 0.001) and radiobinding assays (P less than 0.001). Immunoprecipitin lines were also produced by these antilymphocyte sera against extracts from Yersinia enterocolitica and Shigella sonnci microorganisms. Rabbit anti-klebsiella sera had lymphocytotoxic activity against HLA-B27 lymphocytes obtained from patients with ankylosing spondylitis (P less than 0.001). These results suggest partial cross-reactivity between some antigens found in several Gram-negative microorganisms and HLA-B27 lymphocytes.
TI  - Diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DIG-ELISA): optimal conditions for quantitation of antibodies.
AB  - In the diffusion-in-gel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DIG-ELISA) the quantitation of antibodies is based on their ability to form a diffusion gradient over an antigen-coated polystyrene surface. The antigen-antibody reaction is then visualized by an enzyme-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin. The enzyme-substrate reaction is finally performed by pouring a substrate-containing gel over the polystyrene surface. In this study with bovine serum albumin as antigen and a corresponding rabbit antiserum, the diffusion time of antiserum was shown to be the most critical variable of the method, while the antigen concentration used for coating, the conjugate binding time and the enzyme-substrate reaction time had a minor influence on the quantitation of antibodies. High antibody levels were measured with greater accuracy than low levels, but the standard deviation was below 10%. It was also shown that different sera containing antibodies to Salmonella typhi O LPS, Klebsiella pneumoniae K1 and O4 LPS, Escherichia coli O2 LPS, Yersinia enterocolitica Y3 LPS, cardiolipin and pneumococcus could be quantitated with the same accuracy.
TI  - [Characteristics and function of enterotoxins of gram negative bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - Several factors are important for the pathogenesis of bacterial intestinal disease: 1. Colonisation of the intestine; 2. exo(= entero)toxin production without penetration into the intestinal wall; 3. invasion of the intestinal wall with or without (?) simultaneous formation of enterotoxin. These factors are of different importance for the various infective agents. Whereas cholera is exclusively caused by an enterotoxin, this is of minor importance for the pathogenesis of Shigella dysentery. The enterotoxins of Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, and Shigella dysenteriae 1 have been intensively studied. Additional enterotoxic substances have been demonstrated in other gramnegative organisms (Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila), which, however, are not yet characterized sufficiently. Future studies will aim to the elucidation of the structure and function of these toxins on the molecular level, and their importance for the pathogenesis of intestinal disease.
TI  - Synthesis of a selective agar medium for Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - A new agar medium for isolation of Yersinia enterocolitica was formulated based on growth studies which defined an optimum basal, and the evaluation of selective chemical agents, dyes, and antibiotics. The final formulation, designated cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin(CIN) agar, provided quantitative recovery of 40 different strains of Y. enterocolitica in 24 h using incubation at 32 degrees C or with 48 h of incubation at 22 degrees C. The medium was highly selective, especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Colony morphology coupled with a differential reaction resulting from mannitol fermentation permitted discrimination of Y. enterocolitica from most of those Gram-negative bacteria that were able to grow on the medium. Recovery and selective characteristics of CIN agar were stable during storage at room temperature for 9 days. CIN agar gave a higher recovery of Y. enterocolitica from feces both direct and with cold enrichment (0.4/1.5%) than Salmonella-Shigella (0.0/0.7%) and MacConkey (0.0/0.9%) agars while significantly reducing the level of background organisms.
TI  - Enzymatic degradation of polygalacturonic acid by Yersinia and Klebsiella species in relation to clinical laboratory procedures.
AB  - As scored by several specified plating procedures, clinical and environmental strains of Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae "Oxytocum" showed detectable, albeit generally weak, ability to digest polygalacturonic (pectic) acid. None of these bacterial strains had the vigorous and rapid pectolytic activity on these polygalacturonic acid-containing media that is typical of soft-rot Erwinia species, although some of the Oxytocum strains came fairly close. Analyses of the pectolytic enzyme contents of the cells and culture supernatants of the Yersinia and Klebsiella species revealed that readily detectable quantities of cell-bound polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase and hydrolytic polygalacturonase were formed by the Yersinia and Klebsiella species; however, the total units of enzyme activity produced by these bacteria were, in general, lower than were produced by soft-rot Erwinia species. Furthermore, unlike the situation in soft-rot Erwinia cultures, these pectolytic enzymes of Yersinia and Klebsiella species were not excreted rapidly and massively into the growth medium. Cultures of other enterobacteria (Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Erwinia amylovora, Erwinia herbicola, Escherichia coli, Proteus species, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens) showed no pectolytic ability whatsoever by any of the plating procedures used and (to the extent they were so examined) produced no pectolytic enzymes detectable either in their cells or culture supernatants. This slow or weak release of pectolytic enzymes by Yersinia and Klebsiella species has a bearing on clinical laboratory procedures suitable for detecting their pectolytic activity; methods adequate for this purpose are detailed.
TI  - Properties of R factors from Bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  - Genetic properties and host ranges of R factors derived from Bordetella bronchiseptica of pig origin were examined. All of 61 R factors tested could confer resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and aminobenzyl penicillin on their host bacteria. All of them were identified as fi(-) (no fertility inhibition) type and were found to exhibit no restriction of phages lambda, phi80, P1, P2, T1, T3, T6, T7, W31, and BF-23. They could confer macarbomysin susceptibility on their host cells when infected. An Rte16, a representative R factor, was incompatible with both RP4 and R40a, which are classified as compatibility groups P and C, respectively. An Rte16 was conjugally transmissible to B. bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, but not to Shigella flexneri, S. sonnei, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
