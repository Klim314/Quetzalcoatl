TI  == ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel patients exhibit distinct abnormalities of the gut microbiota.
AB  == background: previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and the development of ulcerative colitis (uc) and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). our aim was to investigate any quantitative differences in faecal bacterial compositions in uc and ibs patients compared to healthy controls, and to identify individual bacterial species that contribute to these differences. methods: faecal microbiota of 13 uc patients, 11 ibs patients and 22 healthy volunteers were analysed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) using universal and bacteroides specific primers. the data obtained were normalized using in-house developed statistical method and interrogated by multivariate approaches. the differentiated bands were excised and identified by sequencing the v3 region of the 16s rrna genes. results: band profiles revealed that number  of predominant faecal bacteria were significantly different between uc, ibs and control group (p < 10-4). by assessing the mean band numbers in uc (37 +/- 5) and ibs (39 +/- 6), compared to the controls (45 +/- 3), a significant decrease in bacterial species is suggested (p = 0.01). there were no significant differences  between ibs and uc. biodiversity of the bacterial species was significantly lower in uc (mu = 2.94, sigma = 0.29) and ibs patients (mu = 2.90, sigma = 0.38) than controls (mu = 3.25, sigma = 0.16; p = 0.01). moreover, similarity indices revealed greater biological variability of predominant bacteria in uc and ibs compared to the controls (median dice coefficients 76.1% (iqr 70.9 - 83.1), 73.8% (iqr 67.0 - 77.5) and 82.9% (iqr 79.1 - 86.7) respectively). dna sequencing of discriminating bands suggest that the presence of bacteroides vulgatus, b. ovatus, b. uniformis, and parabacteroides sp. in healthy volunteers distinguishes them from ibs and uc patients. dgge profiles of bacteroides species revealed a decrease of bacteroides community in uc relative to ibs and controls. conclusion: molecular profiling of faecal bacteria revealed abnormalities of intestinal microbiota in uc and ibs patients, while different patterns of bacteroides species loss in particular, were associated with uc and ibs.

TI  == bacteroides chinchillae sp. nov. and bacteroides rodentium sp. nov., isolated from chinchilla (chinchilla lanigera) faeces.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated from chinchilla (chinchilla lanigera)  faeces and three strains, st170(t), st180 and st28(t), were investigated taxonomically. on the basis of phylogenetic analyses and specific phenotypic characteristics, the three strains belonged to the genus bacteroides. phylogenetic analysis of their 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that strains st170(t) and st180 formed a single cluster and a distinct line of descent. strain st170(t) exhibited 99.7 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with strain st180 and 95.1, 94.6 and 94.4 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with bacteroides massiliensis jcm 13223(t), bacteroides dorei jcm 13471(t) and bacteroides vulgatus jcm 5826(t), respectively. strain st28(t) also formed a distinct line of descent and exhibited the highest 16s rrna gene sequence similarity with bacteroides uniformis jcm 5828(t) (98.1 %). low dna-dna relatedness (1 %) between strain st28(t) and b. uniformis jcm 5828(t) clearly indicated that they belonged  to different species. analysis of hsp60 sequences also supported these relationships. the dna g+c contents of strains st170(t) and st28(t) were 45.2 and 41.0 mol%, respectively. on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and phylogenetic data, two novel species, bacteroides chinchillae sp. nov. (type strain st170(t) = jcm 16497(t) = ccug 59335(t)) and bacteroides rodentium sp. nov. (type strain st28(t) = jcm 16496(t) = ccug 59334(t)), are proposed.

TI  == bacteroides clarus sp. nov., bacteroides fluxus sp. nov. and bacteroides oleiciplenus sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == three gram-stain-negative, obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria (strains yit 12056t, yit 12057t and yit 12058t) were isolated from human faeces. these strains were characterized by phylogenetic analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequence and phenotypic tests. 16s rrna gene sequence analyses revealed that strains yit 12056t, yit 12057t and yit 12058t were most closely related to the type strains of bacteroides gallinarum, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides intestinalis with approximate similarity values of 96.6, 95.0 and 96.7%, respectively. the dna g+c contents of the novel strains were 45.3 (yit 12056t), 45.2 (yit 12057t) and 43.6 mol% (yit 12058t) and the major respiratory quinones of all three isolates were menaquinones mk-10 and mk-11. these properties were typical for members of the genus bacteroides. the results of the other phenotypic analyses also supported the affiliation of these strains to the genus bacteroides. the 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, analysis of the major cellular  fatty acids and other biochemical tests enabled the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of the three new strains. based on these data, three novel species, bacteroides clarus sp. nov., bacteroides fluxus sp. nov. and bacteroides oleiciplenus sp. nov. are proposed. the type strains of b. clarus, b. fluxus and  b. oleiciplenus are yit 12056t (=jcm 16067t=dsm 22519t), yit 12057t (=jcm 16101t=dsm 22534t) and yit 12058t (=jcm 16102t=dsm 22535t), respectively.

TI  == species identification of clinical isolates of bacteroides by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and related species are important human pathogens involved in mixed infections of different origins. the b. fragilis group isolates are phenotypically very similar, grow more slowly than aerobic bacteria and, accordingly, are frequently misidentifed with classical or automated phenotypical identification methods. recent taxonomic changes and new species accepted as members of the bacteroides genus are not included in the different databases of commercially available identification kits. the use of matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) was therefore evaluated for the species identification of 277 clinical isolates of the bacteroides genus. species identification was carried out with maldi bruker daltonik biotyper software (bruker daltonik gmbh, bremen, germany) by comparing the mass spectrum of each strain with the mass spectra of the 3260 reference strains currently available. the results of conventional phenotypical identification of the isolates were used as a reference. 16s rrna gene sequencing was performed for a selection of the strains that gave discrepant results and for all those inconclusively identified by maldi-tof ms; 270 isolates (97.5%) were unequivocally identified [log(score) >/=2.0] by comparison with the reference strains present in the maldi biotyper database. of the 23 isolates for which the  maldi-tof ms species identification differed from the conventional phenotypical identification, 11 were sequenced. the sequencing data confirmed the maldi-tof ms result in ten cases and, for the remaining isolate, the sequencing data did not lead to the determination of the species, but only to that of the genus (bacteroides sp.). the discriminating power and identification accuracy of maldi-tof ms proved to be superior to that of biochemical testing for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides uniformis.

TI  == bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov., bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. and bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov., isolated from chicken caecum.
AB  == eight bacterial strains isolated from the caecum of chicken, bl2(t), bl66, eg3, eg6, m27, bl78(t), c35(t) and c43, were characterized by determining their phenotypic characteristics, cellular fatty acid profiles, menaquinone profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates belonged to the genus bacteroides. one group of five strains (bl2(t), bl66, eg3, eg6 and m27) was related most closely to bacteroides coprocola jcm 12979(t), with approximately 93 % 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, and to bacteroides plebeius jcm 12973(t), with about 92 % similarity, and shared >or=99.6 % similarity with each other. strain bl78(t) exhibited 90.5 % similarity to b. plebeius jcm 12973(t) and 89.8 % similarity to b. coprocola jcm 12979(t) and differed from the above group of five strains at >or=10 % sequence divergence. strains c35(t) and c43 were related most closely to bacteroides eggerthii jcm 12986(t), with 95.1 % sequence similarity, to bacteroides stercoris jcm 9496(t), with 94.6 % similarity, and to bacteroides  uniformis jcm 5828(t), with 94.4 % similarity, and shared 100 % similarity with each other. from results of phenotypic examination, cellular fatty acid composition analysis, menaquinone composition analysis and dna g+c contents, the  group of five strains as well as strain bl78(t) were shown to differ from the type strains of b. coprocola and b. plebeius. strain bl78(t) differed from the others based on its menaquinone composition, which included mk-11 and mk-12. strains c35(t) and c43 could also be differentiated from the type strains of b. eggerthii, b. stercoris and b. uniformis. the group of five strains, strain bl78(t), b. coprocola jcm 12979(t) and b. plebeius jcm 12973(t) showed low levels of dna-dna relatedness (<35 %) with each other. high levels of dna-dna relatedness were obtained within the group of five strains (>75 %). strains c35(t) and c43 exhibited a high level of dna-dna relatedness (>88 %) with each other, but low levels with b. eggerthii jcm 12986(t) (<40 %), b. stercoris jcm 9496(t) (<37 %) and b. uniformis jcm 5828(t) (<16 %). on the basis of these data, three novel bacteroides species are proposed: bacteroides barnesiae sp. nov. (type strain bl2(t)=jcm 13652(t)=dsm 18169(t)), bacteroides salanitronis sp. nov. (type strain bl78(t)=jcm 13657(t)=dsm 18170(t)) and bacteroides gallinarum sp. nov. (type strain c35(t)=jcm 13658(t)=dsm 18171(t)).

TI  == bacteroides intestinalis sp. nov., isolated from human faeces.
AB  == during studies of the microbiota of human faeces, five strains of gram-negative anaerobic rods were isolated following growth in a polyamine-deficient medium. these strains belonged to the genus bacteroides on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence data. 16s rrna gene sequence similarity between one of the strains, 341t, and recognized species within the genus bacteroides was <95 %. the dna g+c  content (44 mol%) and major fatty acid composition (anteiso-c(15 : 0), 32.0 %) supported the affiliation of strain 341(t) to the genus bacteroides. biochemical  tests and dna-dna hybridization analysis demonstrated that strain 341t was distinct from bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides helcogenes, to which it was related most closely. on the basis of these data, a novel bacteroides species, bacteroides intestinalis sp. nov., is proposed with strain 341t (= jcm 13265t = dsm 17393t) as the type strain.

TI  == effects of difructose anhydride iii (dfa iii) administration on rat intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the effects of difructose anhydride iii (di-d-fructofuranose-1,2':2,3'-dianhydride; dfa iii) administration (3% dfa iii for 4 weeks) on rat intestinal microbiota were examined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). according to dgge profiles, the number of bacteria related to bacteroides acidofaciens and uncultured bacteria within the clostridium lituseburense group decreased, while that of bacteria related to bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides uniformis and ruminococcus productus increased  in dfa iii-fed rat cecum. in the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats, a lowering of ph and an increase in short chain fatty acids (scfas), especially acetic acid, were observed. the dfa iii-assimilating bacterium, ruminococcus sp. m-1, was isolated from the cecal contents of dfa iii-fed rats. the strain had 98% similarity with r. productus atcc 27340t (l76595), and mainly produced acetic acid. these results confirmed that the bacteria harmful to host health were not increased by dfa iii administration. moreover, dfa iii stimulated the growth of ruminococcus sp. m-1 producing acetic acid, which may alter the intestinal microbiota towards a healthier composition. it is expected that dfa iii would be  a new candidate as a prebiotic.

TI  == virulence markers and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria of the bacteroides fragilis group isolated from stool of children with diarrhea in sao paulo, brazil.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis has been isolated from several human and non-human monomicrobial and mixed infections. in this study, some virulence markers and the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria of the b. fragilis group isolated from children's stools were evaluated. all the 64 isolates showed the following characteristics: capsulated, beta-hemolytic, hydrophilic, and serum-resistant. only, 24 (37.5%) strains were resistant at 60 masculine c, for 30 min, and among  them, 12 (18.75%) were resistant at 60 masculine c, for 60 min. also, none strain was resistant at 100 masculine c. four strains were able to hemagglutinate erythrocytes and d-mannose, d-galactose, d-arabinose, and d-xylose inhibited hemagglutination in 2 b. fragilis strains (p76a, p76b). the hemagglutination in the strain b. uniformis p3-2 was inhibited by d-xylose and d-galactose. the bft gene detection and the enterotoxin production were observed only in 13 ef-enterotoxigenic species. fragilysin activity was confirmed on ht-29 cells. the antimicrobial determination confirmed that both imipenem and metronidazole were efficient against b. fragilis species; all the strains were resistant to lead and nickel. plasmids of 2.9, 4.4, 4.8, and 8.9 kb were observed in 6 tested strains.  these results show the values of the species identification from clinical infections, as well as of the periodic evaluation of the resistance patterns of the b. fragilis group at brazilian medical institutions.

TI  == bacteroides infections in children.
AB  == from 1974 to 1990, 336 bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. they comprised 180 (54%) b. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) b. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) b. vulgatus, 34 (10%) b. distasonis, 21 (6%) b. ovatus and 10 (3%) b. uniformis. infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. most bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). predisposing conditions were present  in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy  (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body  (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). the micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), escherichia coli (122), fusobacterium spp. (38) and clostridium spp. (30). all patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. all but 12 (5%) patients recovered. these data illustrate the importance of bacteroides spp. in infections in children.
