TI  - Molecular diversity of bacteria in Yunnan yellow cattle (Bos taurs) from Nujiang  region, China.
AB  - The rumen content of four Yunnan Yellow Cattle (Bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 OTU (Operational Taxonomy Unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. Similarity analysis revealed that Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 12 sequences (10 OTU) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succiniclasticum ruminis, Ruminococcus bromii, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and Prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total OTU). The further 12 sequences (9 OTU) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria Clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, Schwartzia succinivorans, Prevotella ruminicola, Eubacterium ruminantium, Ruminococcus albus, and Clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of the total OTU). The remaining 105 sequences (90 OTU) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total OTU). According to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low G+C subdivision (accounting for 72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and OTU, respectively) and CFB subdivision (Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and OTU, respectively). Among the examined clones, rare bacteria Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.
TI  - Cell-associated alpha-amylases of butyrate-producing Firmicute bacteria from the  human colon.
AB  - Selected butyrate-producing bacteria from the human colon that are related to Roseburia spp. and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens showed a good ability to utilize a variety of starches for growth when compared with the Gram-negative amylolytic anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. A major cell-associated amylase of high molecular mass (140-210 kDa) was detected in each strain by SDS-PAGE zymogram analysis, and genes corresponding to these enzymes were analysed for two representative strains. Amy13B from But. fibrisolvens 16/4 is a multi-domain enzyme of 144.6 kDa that includes a family 13 glycoside hydrolase domain, and duplicated family 26 carbohydrate-binding modules. Amy13A (182.4 kDa), from Roseburia inulinivorans A2-194, also includes a family 13 domain, which is preceded by two repeat units of approximately 116 aa rich in aromatic residues, an isoamylase N-terminal domain, a pullulanase-associated domain, and an additional unidentified domain. Both Amy13A and Amy13B have N-terminal signal peptides and C-terminal cell-wall sorting signals, including a modified LPXTG motif similar to that involved in interactions with the cell surface in other Gram-positive bacteria, a hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a basic C terminus. The overexpressed family 13 domains showed an absolute requirement for Mg2+ or Ca2+ for activity, and functioned as 1,4-alpha-glucanohydrolases (alpha-amylases; EC 3.2.1.1). These major starch-degrading enzymes thus appear to be anchored to the cell wall in this important group of human gut bacteria.
TI  - Metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their toxicity to the microflora of the rumen.
AB  - Ruminal microorganisms hydrogenate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) present in  forages and thereby restrict the availability of health-promoting PUFA in meat and milk. The aim of this study was to investigate PUFA metabolism and the influence of PUFA on members of the ruminal microflora. Eleven of 26 predominant species of ruminal bacteria metabolised linoleic acid (LA; cis-9,cis-12-18:2) substantially. The most common product was vaccenic acid (trans-11-18:1), produced by species related to Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. alpha-Linolenic acid (LNA; cis-9,cis-12,cis-15-18:3) was metabolised mostly by the same species. The fish oil fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5(n - 3)) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6(n - 3)) were not metabolised. Cellulolytic bacteria did not grow in the presence of any PUFA at 50 microg ml(-1), nor did some butyrate-producing bacteria, including the stearate producer Clostridium proteoclasticum, Butyrivibrio hungatei and Eubacterium ruminantium. Toxicity to growth was ranked EPA > DHA > LNA > LA. Cell integrity, as measured using propidium iodide, was damaged by LA in all 26 bacteria, but to different extents. Correlations between its effects on growth and apparent effects on cell integrity in different bacteria were low. Combined effects of LA and sodium lactate in E. ruminantium and C. proteoclasticum indicated that LA toxicity is linked to metabolism in butyrate-producing bacteria. PUFA also inhibited the growth of the cellulolytic ruminal fungi, with Neocallimastix frontalis producing small amounts of cis-9,trans-11-18:2 (CLA) from LA. Thus, while dietary PUFA might be useful in suppressing the numbers of biohydrogenating ruminal bacteria, particularly C. proteoclasticum, care should be taken to avoid unwanted effects in suppressing cellulolysis.
TI  - Effect of oral administration of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens MDT-1 on experimental  enterocolitis in mice.
AB  - Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens MDT-1, a butyrate-producing strain, was evaluated for use as a probiotic to prevent enterocolitis. Oral administration of the MDT-1 strain (10(9) CFU/dose) alleviated the symptoms of colitis (including body weight loss, diarrhea, bloody stool, organic disorder, and mucosal damage) that are induced in mice drinking water that contains 3.0% dextran sulfate sodium. In addition, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity levels in colonic tissue were reduced, suggesting that MDT-1 mitigates bowel inflammation. The addition of MDT-1 culture supernatant inhibited the growth of nine clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli that could potentially cause enterocolitis. Infection of mice with C. coli 11580-3, one of the isolates inhibited by MDT-1 in vitro, resulted in diarrhea, mucosal damage, increased MPO activity levels in colonic tissue, increased numbers of C. coli in the cecum, and decreased body weight gain. However, administration of MDT-1 to mice, prior to and during C. coli infection, reduced these effects. These results suggest that Campylobacter-induced enterocolitis can be alleviated by using B. fibrisolvens as a probiotic.
TI  - Occurrence of restriction-modification systems in ruminal butyrate-producing bacteria.
AB  - Thirty-five strains of ruminal bacteria belonging to the former Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens species were screened for the presence of site-specific restriction endonuclease and modification methyltransferase activities. Seven strains possessed endonuclease activities detectable in crude cell extracts. The recognition sequences and optimal reaction conditions for seven of them were determined. Five enzymes were found to be isoschizomers of type II endonucleases (EcoRV, NsiI, AseI (2x) and SauI), one was type IIS (FokI) and two remained unknown. The optimal reaction buffer was found to be a low ionic strength buffer and all enzymes possessed sufficient activity at 39 degrees C. The presence of DNA modification among all strains was also determined. Most of the methylation activities correlated with restriction activities, yet some strains possessed unaccompanied modification methyltransferases.
TI  - Oral administration of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, a butyrate-producing bacterium, decreases the formation of aberrant crypt foci in the colon and rectum of mice.
AB  - Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, a butyrate-producing ruminal bacterium, was evaluated  for use as a probiotic to prevent colorectal cancer. Oral administration to Jcl:ICR mice of a new strain of B. fibrisolvens (MDT-1) that produces butyrate at a high rate (10(9) cfu/dose) increased the rate of butyrate production by fecal microbes, suggesting that MDT-1 can grow in the gut. The number of colorectal aberrant crypt foci (ACF), putative preneoplastic lesions induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, was reduced after MDT-1 administration (10(9) cfu/dose, 3 times/wk for 4 wk). The number of aberrant crypts (ACs), number of foci having 3 or 4 ACs per focus, and the percentage of mice having 3 or 4 ACs per focus were also reduced, suggesting that the progress of lesions was suppressed by MDT-1. Interestingly, the MDT-1 cell homogenate did not have a similar beneficial effect. MDT-1 had low beta-glucuronidase activity, and administration of MDT-1 reduced the beta-glucuronidase activity in the colorectal contents. The numbers of natural killer (NK) and NKT cells in the spleen were markedly enhanced in response to MDT-1. Decreased beta-glucuronidase activity and increased numbers of NK and NKT cells and butyrate production may explain in part why MDT-1 administration suppressed ACF formation. These results suggest that colorectal cancer may be prevented or suppressed by the utilization of MDT-1 as a probiotic. Administration of MDT-1 had no harmful effect on the health of mice at least for 3 mo.
TI  - Butyrivibrio hungatei sp. nov. and Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans sp. nov., butyrate-producing bacteria from the rumen.
AB  - Two novel Gram-negative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, butyrate-producing bacterial species, strains Mz 5T and JK 615T, were isolated from the rumen fluid of cow and sheep. Both strains were curved rods that were motile by means of single polar or subpolar flagellum and common in the rumen microbial ecosystem. Strain Mz 5T produced high xylanase, proteinase, pectin hydrolase and DNase activities; 1,4-beta-endoglucanase was also detected in the culture medium. The bacterium utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. Glucose was fermented to formate, butyrate, lactate, succinate and ethanol. The DNA G + C content was 42.1 mol%. The complete 16S rDNA sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships were determined. Strain Mz 5T and related isolates were located in clostridial cluster XIVa and were closely related to Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Butyrivibrio crossotus, Roseburia cecicola and Eubacterium rectale. The name proposed for this novel bacterium is Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans; the type strain is Mz 5T (=DSM 14809T =ATCC BAA-455T). Strain JK 615T produced no fibrolytic activity, but utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. Glucose was fermented to formate, acetate, butyrate and ethanol. The DNA G + C content was 44-8 mol%. The complete 16S rDNA sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships were determined. Strain JK 615T was located in clostridial cluster XIVa and was closely related to Clostridium proteoclasticum, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Eubacterium halii. The name proposed for this novel bacterium is Butyrivibrio hungatei; the type strain is JK 615T (=DSM 14810T =ATCC BAA-456T).
TI  - Presence of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens in the digestive tract of dogs and cats, and its contribution to butyrate production.
AB  - Numbers of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, a major butyrate-producing bacterium in the rumen, in feces of dogs and cats were estimated by competitive PCR. The type IIb of B. fibrisolvens, which produces much more lactate than butyrate, was detected at the levels (cells per g of feces dry weight) of 2.4x10(3)-9.0x10(5) for dogs and 1.7x10(4-)-6.2x10(5) for cats. However, the type I that produces much more butyrate than the type IIb was not detected in cat or dog feces (less than 6.0x10(4) cells per g of feces dry weight). Butyrate production by B. fibrisolvens type IIb in feces was estimated to be at most 30% of the butyrate production by mixed fecal microbes, which suggested that more butyrate is produced by microbes other than B. fibrisolvens in the intestines. Addition of B. fibrisolvens ATCC19171 (type I) to a culture of mixed fecal microbes increased butyrate production, and OB156 (type IIb) increased lactate production. When both the types were added, both the products were increased. Thus, introduction of both the types of B. fibrisolvens as a probiotic may increase butyrate and lactate production in the large intestine, which is possibly beneficial for the maintenance or improvement of the health of dogs and cats.
TI  - 16S rDNA analysis of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens: phylogenetic position and relation to butyrate-producing anaerobic bacteria from the rumen of white-tailed deer.
AB  - Complete 16S rDNA sequences of six strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, including the type strain (ATCC 19171), were determined. The type strain was found to have less than 89% sequence similarity to the other isolates that were examined. The five plasmid-bearing strains formed a closely related cluster and three of these strains (OB156, OB157 and OB192) were very highly related (> 99%), indicating that they are isolates of the same genomic species. The phylogenetic position of Butyrivibrio was found to be within the subphylum Clostridium, of Gram-positive bacteria. The closest relatives to the type strain were Eubacterium cellulosolvens and Cl. xylanolyticum and the closest relatives to the separately clustered strains were Roseburia ceciola, Lachnospira pectinoschiza and Eubacterium rectale.
