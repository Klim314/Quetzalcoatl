TI  - Quantitative survival of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms in Port-A-Cul and Copan transport systems.
AB  - Transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. In this study, the Port-A-Cul transport system and the Copan transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. Dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. Combination I contained Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., group B streptococci, Lactobacillus crispatus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Combination II contained Lactobacillus iners, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Mobiluncus curtisii, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Gardnerella vaginalis. Duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees C. Both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. Prevotella bivia and Prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. However, at 24 degrees C, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for Mycoplasma hominis, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella corporis, and Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in Copan transport medium than when they were stored in Port-A-Cul transport medium for 96 h (P < 0.002). Some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees C for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group B streptococci and Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. organisms in Copan medium than in Port-A-Cul medium was observed (P < 0.002). At room temperature, the Port-A-Cul system is superior to the Copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of heat-modifiable proteins from the outer membrane of Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Active porins were isolated and purified from the outer membranes of the gram-negative anaerobic rod Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and the aerobic coccobacillus Acinetobacter baumannii. The porins from both bacteria appear to be monomers when isolated and purified. Both porins exhibited decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE after boiling for 10 min in the sample buffer. After heating, their molecular weight is estimated at 43 kDa while without heating they run as proteins with a molecular weight of approximately 37 kDa. Due to their characteristic heat-modifiability, these proteins were named HMP (heat-modifiable protein)-P. asaccharolytica and HMP-A. baumannii. Amino acid analysis revealed both porins to be hydrophilic proteins. These proteins have been shown to be active in transporting sugars when incorporated into liposomes. The permeability of both porins for L-arabinose was less than that produced by the porin of Escherichia coli B. Permeability to high molecular weight disaccharides was lower than for small monosaccharides. Western blot analysis did not reveal any antigenic cross reaction between HMP-A. baumannii and the HMP-P. asaccharolytica. The results obtained in this study confirm that although these heat-modifiable proteins are pore forming proteins and have similar activity they differ in their antigenicity.
TI  - Diffusion of beta-lactam antibiotics through oligomeric or monomeric porin channels of some gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The penetration of anionic beta-lactam antibiotics through porins was evaluated as a mechanism of drug resistance. The major proteins with porin activity were purified from the outer membranes of six bacteria. Three of the six porins were oligomeric porins. The molecular weights of their monomers were 37 kDa from Photobacterium damsela, 42 kDa from Serratia liquefaciens, and 36 kDa from E. coli B. The other three porins were heat-modifiable monomeric porins with molecular weights of 43 kDa from Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Acinetobacter baumannii, and 37 kDa from Escherichia coli K12. Comparison of the six porin proteins revealed that, independent of their aggregation state, their amino acid content is similar but not identical. All have double the amount of negatively charged amino acids compared with positively charged amino acids. They have a similar polarity and polarity index. Two of the six tested bacteria do not produce beta-lactamase. These two bacteria were sensitive to the different beta-lactams tested. The other four bacteria were resistant to all or to several beta-lactams.A modified liposome swelling method was used for determining the rate of penetration of charged beta-lactam antibiotics. Zwitterionic beta-lactams were found to penetrate into liposomes at a rate that more or less fits their molecular weight, whether the porins are monomeric or oligomeric. The penetration rates of negatively charged beta-lactams are different for oligomeric and monomeric porins. Negatively charged beta-lactams penetrate through oligomeric porins better than estimated by their molecular weight, whereas monomeric porins are less penetrable to negatively charged beta-lactams than estimated by their molecular weight. The contribution of all types of porins to the susceptibility of bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics (zwitterionic or negatively charged) is apparently doubtful. The porins may decrease or increase bacterial penetration rates to beta-lactams, and only the existence of a potential beta-lactamase that can destroy the penetrating drug will cause resistance.
TI  - Construction of a plasmid vector for transformation of Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - A host-vector system for transformation of Porphyromonas gingivalis was constructed using a set (1) strains that can incorporate plasmid DNA by electroporation regardless of its source and (2) stable vector plasmids with a selectable marker. First, restriction-negative mutants were isolated, because P. gingivalis possesses restriction modification systems by which DNA introduced by transformation even from heterologous strains of the same species is excluded. For screening of the mutants, plasmid pE5-2 was employed since it could be transconjugated (mobilized) to P. gingivalis from Escherichia coli and is able to replicate in this species, albeit not stably. pE5-2 DNA prepared from E coli was introduced by electroporation into chemically mutagenized P. gingivalis cells. By this method, three putative restriction-negative clones were selected. These strains exhibited a capacity for electroporation with plasmid DNAs both from E. coli and from various P. gingivalis strains at a similar efficiency. Using one of the derivatives thus obtained, YH522, we then screened for plasmids that could replicate stably in P. gingivalis. Since no plasmids were found from P. gingivalis, cryptic plasmids from other species of black-pigmented oral anaerobic rods were examined for their ability to transform P. gingivalis. A series of plasmids constructed by ligation with pBR322 for replication in E. coli and the EcoRI-B fragment from pBF4 containing erythromycin resistance were prepared from E. coli and were used for electroporation of P. gingivalis. Among these, a recombinant plasmid containing the replicon of pYHBA1 from Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, designated pYH400, was found to be incorporated into the restriction-negative P. gingivalis strain and replicated stably. This set of recipient strains and stable plasmids with a selectable marker constitutes the first practical host-vector system for this species.
TI  - A study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  - Semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. The number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. Standard methods were used for the investigations. Five main genera of anaerobic bacteria were isolated from all patients. They included, the Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Clostridium spp. Five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including Prevotella bivia, P. disiens, P. melanogenica, P. asaccharolytica and B. fragilis. The predominant flora was P. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. The semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). Similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Prevotella and Porphyromonas infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1994, 504 isolates of Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were obtained from 435 (21%) of 2033 specimens from 418 children. They included 160 (32%) Pr. melaninogenica, 105 (21%) Pr. intermedia, 84 (17%) P. asaccharolytica, 58 (12%) Pr. orisbuccae, and 58 (12%) Pr. oralis. Most Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were isolated from abscesses (176), pulmonary infections (85), ear infections (82), wound infections (44), peritonitis (38), paronychia (15) and chronic sinusitis (14). Predisposing conditions were noted in 111 (27%) of the cases; these included previous surgery in 41 (10%), foreign body in 36 (9%), neurological deficiencies in 29 (7%), immunodeficiency in 21 (5%), steroid therapy in 12 (4%), diabetes in 8 (2%) and malignancy in 7 (2%). Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were the only isolates in 14 (3%) patients, and mixed infection was encountered in 404 (97%). The micro-organisms most commonly isolated with Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. were anaerobic cocci (393 isolates), Fusobacterium spp. (108), Bacteroides spp. (B. fragilis group) (95), Escherichia coli (56) and other gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (52). Most Bacteroides spp. and E. coli were isolated from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections around the rectal area, whereas most Fusobacterium spp. were isolated from oropharyngeal, pulmonary and head and neck sites. beta-Lactamase production was detected in 191 (38%) Prevotella and Porphyromonas isolates from all body sites. All patients received antimicrobial therapy, and surgical drainage was performed in 173 (41%) cases. Four patients died from their infection. These data illustrate the spectrum and importance of Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in infections in children.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the nahA gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis indicates that beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase is an outer-membrane-associated lipoprotein.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated in human periodontal diseases. It expresses a number of exoglycosidase enzymes capable of hydrolysing host proteoglycan residues. As a first stage to explore the role of these enzymes in periodontal tissue damage, the nahA gene of P. gingivalis W83, which encodes beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (beta-Nahase), was cloned. The gene was expressed poorly in Escherichia coli, but increased expression was achieved by cloning the nahA gene downstream of the tac promoter. Southern blot analysis revealed that nahA was present as a single copy, and it was found in all the other P. gingivalis strains tested. In contrast, sequences homologous to nahA were not detected in either P. endodontalis or P. asaccharolytica. The nahA gene was 2331 bp long and encoded a beta-Nahase enzyme of 777 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kDa. A characteristic signal peptide for an acylated lipoprotein was present at the amino-terminus, suggesting that the mature beta-Nahase is a lipoprotein. The predicted amino acid sequence of the P. gingivalis beta-Nahase shared homology with the catalytic domains of the human beta-Nahase enzyme and the chitinase of Vibrio harveyi, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism.
