TI  == the effects of dietary vitamin c on mucosal immune responses and growth performance in caspian roach (rutilus rutilus caspicus) fry.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of different levels of dietary vitamin c on some skin mucus immune parameters, mucus antimicrobial activity and growth performance of caspian roach (rutilus rutilus caspicus) fry.  six hundred sixty caspian roach (1.4 +/- 0.02 g) fry were allocated to 12 tanks (55 fish per tank), and triplicate groups were fed diets containing 0, 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 mg kg(-1) vitamin c for 60 days. at the end of the trial, the epidermal mucus protein level, alkaline phosphatase and antimicrobial activity against two gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus faecium and micrococcus luteus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and serratia marcescens) as well as  growth performance were measured. the results demonstrated that feeding on vitamin c significantly elevated skin mucus alkaline phosphatase and protein levels compared to the control group (p < 0.05). however, lysozyme activity was undetectable in both the vitamin c-fed roach fry and the control group. skin mucus antimicrobial activity was increased following vitamin c administration, and the bacterial growth inhibition zones were significantly elevated in vitamin  c-fed roach (p < 0.05). similar results were obtained in case of the minimum inhibitory concentration of skin mucus. also fish fed the control diet had a significantly lower weight gain, specific growth rate and condition factor compared to the other treatments (p < 0.05). these results revealed that dietary  vitamin c beneficially affects the skin mucus immune parameters and growth performance of caspian roach fry.

TI  == type aii lantibiotic bovicin hj50 with a rare disulfide bond: structure, structure-activity relationships and mode of action.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides containing unusual amino acids. as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics, they  have a high potential for alleviating the problem of emergent antibiotic resistance, with possible applications in many industries that have antibacterial demand. bovicin hj50 is a type aii lantibiotic, the largest group of lantibiotics, comprising a linear n-terminal region and a globular c-terminal region. interestingly, bovicin h50 has a disulfide bond that is rare in this group. owing to limited information about the spatial structures of type aii lantibiotics, the functional regions of this type and the role of the disulfide bond are still unknown. in the present study, we resolved the solution structure  of bovicin hj50 using nmr spectroscopy. this is the first spatial structure of a  type aii lantibiotic. bovicin hj50 exhibited high flexibility in aqueous solution, whereas varied rigidities were observed in the different rings with the conserved ring a being the most rigid. the charged residues lys(1)(1), asp(1)(2)  and lys(3)(0), as well as the essential disulfide bond were critical for antimicrobial activity. importantly, bovicin hj50 showed not only peptidoglycan precursor lipid ii-binding ability, but also pore-forming activity, which is significantly different from other bacteriostatic type aii lantibiotics, suggesting a novel antimicrobial mechanism.

TI  == antimicrobial function of the gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide in the skin of  skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis.
AB  == a 3.4 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified skin extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with that of other known polypeptides revealed high sequence homology with the yfgap (yellowfin tuna glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-related antimicrobial peptide); thus, this peptide was identified as the skipjack tuna gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide (sjgap). sjgap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 1.2-17.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli d31, and vibrio parahaemolyticus (mecs, 3.1-12.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec, 16.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide is heat-stable but salt-sensitive. according to the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling, this peptide consists  of three secondary structural motifs, including one alpha-helix and two parallel  beta-strands, and forms an amphipathic structure. this peptide showed neither membrane permeabilization ability nor killing ability, but did display a small degree of leakage ability. these results suggest that sjgap acts through a bacteriostatic process rather than bactericidal one. sjgap is another gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide isolated from skipjack tuna and likely plays  an important role for gapdh in the innate immune defense of tuna fish.

TI  == protective role of the neuropeptide urocortin ii against experimental sepsis and  leishmaniasis by direct killing of pathogens.
AB  == we currently face an alarming resurgence in infectious diseases characterized by  antimicrobial resistance and therapeutic failure. this has generated the urgent need of developing new therapeutic approaches that include agents with nontraditional modes of action. a recent interest focused on approaches based on  our natural immune defenses, especially on peptides that combine innate antimicrobial activity against diverse pathogens and immunoregulatory functions.  in this study, to our knowledge, we describe for the first time the antimicrobial activity of the neuropeptide urocortin ii (ucnii) against a panel of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and tropical parasites of the genus leishmania. importantly, this cytotoxicity was selective for pathogens, because ucnii did not affect mammalian cell viability. structurally, ucnii has a cationic and amphipathic design that resembles antimicrobial peptides. using mutants and ucnii fragments, we determined the structural requirements for the interaction between the peptide and the surface of pathogen. following its binding to pathogen, ucnii caused cell death through different membrane-disrupting mechanisms that involve aggregation and membrane depolarization in bacteria and pore formation in leishmania. noteworthily, ucnii killed the infective form of leishmania major even inside the infected macrophages. consequently, ucnii prevented mortality caused by polymicrobial sepsis and ameliorated pathological signs of cutaneous leishmaniasis. besides its presence in body physical and mucosal barriers, we found that innate immune cells produce ucnii in response to  infections. therefore, ucnii could be considered as an ancient highly-conserved host peptide involved in the natural antimicrobial defense and emerge as an attractive alternative to current treatments for microbial disorders with associated drug resistances.

TI  == site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans, strain jh1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. more specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type  a(i) lanthipeptides. mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pva891. substitutions of the n-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in  ring a and intertwined rings c and d were investigated. a truncation and insertion of residues in ring a and intertwined rings c and d were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain micrococcus luteus atcc 10240. mics against streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 27336, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, clostridium difficile uk1, and micrococcus luteus atcc 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the m. luteus bioassay. this mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the alkaloid-enriched extract from prosopis juliflora pods and its influence on in vitro ruminal digestion.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of alkaloid-enriched extracts from prosopis juliflora (fabaceae) pods in order to evaluate them as feed additives for ruminants. as only the basic chloroformic extract (bce), whose main constituents were juliprosopine (juliflorine), prosoflorine and juliprosine, showed gram-positive antibacterial activity against micrococcus luteus (mic = 25 mug/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic = 50 mug/ml) and streptococcus mutans (mic = 50 mug/ml), its influence on ruminal digestion was evaluated using a semi-automated in vitro gas production technique, with monensin as the positive control. results showed that bce has decreased gas production as  efficiently as monensin after 36 h of fermentation, revealing its positive influence on gas production during ruminal digestion. since p. juliflora is a very affordable plant, this study points out this alkaloid enriched extract from  the pods of prosopis juliflora as a potential feed additive to decrease gas production during ruminal digestion.

TI  == lipopeptide biosurfactants from paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  == although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. these solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. this led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of paenibacillus polymyxa (ppe). a combination of rphplc and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of ppe as fusaricidin b (li-fo4b) and polymyxin d1, with minor contributions from surfactins. this complex (ppe) reduced the biofilm biomass of bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis. in contrast, ampicillin was only effective against s. aureus. ppe also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (samb) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established samb by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. the effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against  single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
AB  == objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm  formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring  at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.

TI  == transient bacteremia after removal of a bonded maxillary expansion appliance.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of transient  bacteremia after the removal of a modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance. methods: the sample consisted of 25 subjects (15 girls, 10 boys; mean  age, 14.4 years; range, 12.2-16.6 years). all subjects underwent rapid maxillary  expansion at the start of the orthodontic treatment with the same type of appliance. two 10-ml blood samples were taken, the first as a baseline and the second 3 minutes after removal of the appliance. all blood samples were incubated in an automated blood culture system, and bacteria were identified by using conventional biochemical methods and api kits (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). results: overt soft-tissue bleeding was observed in 11 of the 25 patients during appliance removal, and 8 of 25 patients showed bacteremia after appliance removal. the data were analyzed with the fisher exact test. no statistically significant relationship was found between overt bleeding and bacteremia incidence (p = 0.054). conclusions: because transient bacteremia is caused by trauma from the removal of the modified bonded rapid maxillary expansion appliance, orthodontists should consider the possibility of bacterial endocarditis in at-risk patients when using splint-type tooth-and-tissue-borne rapid maxillary expansion appliances.

TI  == oxidation of lanthionines renders the lantibiotic nisin inactive.
AB  == the peptide antibiotic nisin a belongs to the group of antibiotics called lantibiotics. they are classified as lantibiotics because they contain the structural group lanthionine. lanthionines are composed of a single sulfur atom that is linked to the beta-carbons of two alanine moieties. these sulfur atoms are vulnerable to environmental oxidation. a mild oxidation reaction was performed on nisin a to determine the relative effects it would have on bioactivity. high-mass-accuracy fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data revealed the addition of seven, eight, and nine oxygens. these  additions correspond to the five lanthionines, two methionines, and two histidines that would be susceptible to oxidation. subsequent bioassays revealed  that the oxidized form of nisin a had a complete loss of bactericidal activity. in a competition study, the oxidized nisin did not appear to have an antagonistic affect on the bioactivity of nisin a, since the addition of an equal molar concentration of the oxidized variant did not have an influence on the bactericidal activity of the native antibiotic. electron microscopy data revealed that the oxidized forms were still capable of assembling into large circular complexes, demonstrating that oxidation does not disrupt the lateral assembly mechanism of the antibiotic. affinity thin-layer chromatography and fluorescence  microscopy experiments suggested that the loss of activity is due to the inability of the oxidized form of nisin to bind to the cell wall precursor lipid  ii. given the loss of bioactivity following oxidation, oxidation should be an important factor to consider in future production, purification, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies.

TI  == impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial surface properties and transport.
AB  == genetic markers have been in popular use for tracing microbial movement in the environment. however, the impact of genetic marker insertion on microbial surface properties and consequent transport is often ignored. for this research, we investigated the impact of luminescence-based genetic marker insertion on bacterial surface properties and transport. typical gram-positive bacterial strains of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis and micrococcus luteus were used as model bacterial strains in this research. we manipulated gene transfer to observe the impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial surface properties based on contact angle measurements, and we conducted column experiments to evaluate the impact of lux gene insertion on bacterial transport. after lux gene insertion, bacterial interactions with the porous media increased, demonstrating stronger deposition potential in the porous media. accordingly, retention of the daughter  strains increased. lux gene insertion also resulted in an increase in bacterial dispersion and equilibrium adsorption in the porous media. the bacterial deposition coefficient was found to correlate with the free energy of interactions between bacteria and the porous media.

TI  == production of the lantibiotic salivaricin a and its variants by oral streptococci and use of a specific induction assay to detect their presence in human saliva.
AB  == salivaricin a (sala), the first streptococcus salivarius lantibiotic to be characterized, appears to be inhibitory to most streptococcus pyogenes strains. a variant of the sala structural gene (sala1) is present in more than 90% of s. pyogenes strains, but only strains of m serotype 4 and t pattern 4 produce the biologically active peptide. the present study identifies four additional variants (sala2 to sala5) of the sala structural gene and demonstrates that each  of the corresponding inhibitory peptides (sala2 to sala5) is produced in vitro. these variants appear to be similar to sala and sala1 in their inhibitory activity against micrococcus luteus and in their ability to act as inducers of sala production. it had previously been shown that s. pyogenes strain sf370 had a deletion (of approximately 2.5 kb) in the salm and salt genes of the sala1 locus. in the present study, several additional characteristic deletions within the sala1 loci were identified. s. pyogenes strains of the same m serotype all share  the same sala1 locus structure. since s. salivarius is a predominant member of the normal oral flora of healthy humans, strains producing anti-s. pyogenes lantibiotics, such as sala, may have excellent potential for use as oral probiotics. in the present study, we have used a highly specific sala induction system to directly detect the presence of sala in the saliva of humans who either naturally harbor populations of sala-producing s. salivarius or who have been colonized with the sala2-producing probiotic s. salivarius k12.

AB  == background: lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. in this  work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. results: bovine gastric extract  (bge) was active against both g+ and g- bacteria, but the effect against gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified bgl had only activity against gram+ bacteria. we were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the bge, and found that the inhibition of gram negative bacteria by bge was due to an artefact caused by acetate. we report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (bg lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific  resistance of some rumen gram positive strains to bgl. conclusions: some gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. we discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == production and properties of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from the swine pathogen streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a major pathogen found in the upper respiratory  tract of swine. in this study, isolates of this bacterial species were tested for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis). of the 38 strains tested, four inhibited the growth of other s. suis isolates according to  a deferred-antagonism plate assay. interestingly, three of the strains were originally isolated from healthy carrier pigs and were considered nonvirulent. three isolates (94-623, 90-1330, and aah4) that produced blis in liquid broth were selected for further characterization. none of the inhibitory activities was related to the production of either organic acids or hydrogen peroxide. the blis  produced by these strains were heat stable and proteinase k, pronase, and elastase sensitive but were trypsin and chymotrypsin resistant. they were stable  at ph 2 and 12 and had molecular masses in the range of 14 to 30 kda. maximum production was observed during the mid-log phase. following a curing procedure with novobiocin, only 90-1330 lost the ability to produce blis, suggesting that the blis might be plasmid encoded. analysis of the inhibitory spectra revealed that the blis-producing strains also inhibited the growth of actinobacillus minor, actinobacillus porcinus, enterococcus durans, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis.  this study reports for the first time the ability of the swine pathogen s. suis serotype 2 to produce blis with the characteristics of classic bacteriocins. further studies are required to investigate the possibility of using bacteriocin-producing strains to prevent swine infections caused by virulent strains of s. suis serotype 2.

TI  == synthesis and biological evaluation of novel leucomycin analogues modified at the c-3 position. i. epimerization and methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group.
AB  == the synthesis and biological evaluation of sixteen-membered macrolides modified at the c-3 position are described. 3-epi-leucomycin a7 (9), 3-o-acyl-3-epi-leucomycin a7 analogues (11a-11e), 3-o-acylleucomycin a7 analogues (13b-13e) and 3-o-methylleucomycin analogues (16a, 16b and 22) were synthesized via fully protected intermediates (7, 5a, 5b and 20). after appropriate modification, subsequent deprotections were performed to furnish a variety of leucomycin analogues. methylation of the 3-hydroxyl group was found to improve the pharmacoprofile of leucomycin antibiotics. 3-o-methylrokitamycin (16b) showed enhanced antibacterial activity in vitro and 3,3''-di-o-methyl-4''-o-(3-methylbutyl)leucomycin v (22) exhibited improved metabolic stability in rat plasma in vitro.

TI  == comparative distribution of azithromycin in lung tissue of patients given oral daily doses of 500 and 1000 mg.
AB  == objectives: the administration of antibacterial agents should be optimized on the basis of their distribution to enhance drug exposure and obtain bacterial eradication. this study examines the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in plasma,  lung tissue and bronchial washing in patients after oral administration of 500 mg versus 1000 mg once daily for 3 days. patients and methods: samples of plasma, lung tissue and bronchial washing were obtained from a cohort of 48 patients during open-chest surgery for lung resection up to 204 h after the last drug dose, and assayed for antibiotic concentrations. results: azithromycin was widely distributed within the lower respiratory tract and sustained levels of the drug were detectable at the last sampling time in lung tissue. doubling the dose of the antibiotic resulted in a proportional increase in lung area under the curve (auc, 1245.4 versus 2514.2 h x mg/kg) and peak tissue concentration (cmax, 8.93 +/- 2.05 versus 18.6 +/- 2.20 mg/kg). the pharmacodynamic parameter auc/mic for susceptible and intermediate strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.5 and 2  mg/l, respectively) increased after administration of the 1000 mg schedule compared with 500 mg (auc/mic0.5 2414 versus 1144 and auc/mic2 2112 versus 814.1  h x mg/kg, respectively) in pulmonary tissue. conclusions: lung exposure to azithromycin is increased proportionally by doubling the dose, which results in a predictable pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drug in the lower respiratory tract.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == bass hepcidin is a novel antimicrobial peptide induced by bacterial challenge.
AB  == we report the isolation of a novel antimicrobial peptide, bass hepcidin, from the gill of hybrid striped bass, white bass (morone chrysops) x striped bass (m. saxatilis). after the intraperitoneal injection of micrococcus luteus and escherichia coli, the peptide was purified from hplc fractions with antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli. sequencing by edman degradation revealed a 21-residue peptide (gcrfccnccpnmsgcgvccrf) with eight putative cysteines. molecular mass measurements of the native peptide and the reduced and alkylated peptide confirmed the sequence with four intramolecular disulfide bridges. peptide sequence homology to human hepcidin and other predicted hepcidins, indicated that the peptide is a new member of the hepcidin family. nucleotide sequences for cdna and genomic dna were determined for white bass. a predicted prepropeptide (85 amino acids) consists of three domains: a signal peptide (24 amino acids), prodomain (40 amino acids) and a mature peptide (21 amino acids). the gene has two introns and three exons. a tata box and several consensus-binding motifs for transcription factors including c/ebp, nuclear factor-kappab, and hepatocyte nuclear factor were found in the region upstream of the transcriptional start site. in white bass liver, hepcidin gene expression was induced 4500-fold following challenge with the fish pathogen, streptococcus iniae, while expression levels remained low in all other tissues tested. a novel  antimicrobial peptide from the gill, bass hepcidin, is predominantly expressed in the liver and highly inducible by bacterial exposure.

TI  == enteric bacteria counteract lipopolysaccharide induction of antimicrobial peptide genes.
AB  == the humoral immunity of drosophila involves the production of antimicrobial peptides, which are induced by evolutionary conserved microbial molecules, like lps. by using drosophila mbn-2 cells, we found that live bacteria, including e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, erwinia carotovora, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, prevented lps from inducing antimicrobial peptide genes, while micrococcus luteus and streptococcus equi did not. the inhibitory effect was seen at bacterial levels from 20 per mbn-2 cell, while antimicrobial peptides were induced at lower bacterial concentrations (< or =2 bacteria per cell) also in the absence of added lps. gel shift experiment suggests that the inhibitory effect is upstream or at the level of the activation of the transcription factor relish, a member of the nf-kappab/rel family. the bacteria have to be in physical contact with the cells, but not phagocytosed, to prevent lps induction. interestingly, the inhibiting mechanism is, at least for e. coli, independent of the type iii secretion system, indicating that the inhibitory mechanism is unrelated to the one earlier described for yopj from yersinia.

TI  == physiological characterization of streptococcus bovis mutants that can resist 2-deoxyglucose-induced lysis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1 does not normally lyse, but stationary phase lysis can be induced by including 2-deoxyglucose (2dg) in the growth medium. isolates deficient in glucose/2dg phosphotransferase activity (pts-) also lysed when 2dg was present (lys+) and this result indicated that 2dg phosphorylation via the pts was not an obligate requirement for 2dg-induced lysis. cells and cell walls from  2dg-grown cultures lysed faster when proteinase k was added, but glucose-grown cultures and cell walls were not affected. a lipoteichoic acid (lta) extract (aqueous phase from hot phenol treatment) from glucose-grown cells inhibited the  lysis of 2dg-grown cultures, but a similar extract prepared from 2dg-grown cells  was without effect. thin-layer chromatography and differential staining indicated that wild-type and lys+ pts- cells incorporated 2dg into lta, but lysis-resistant cultures (lys- pts+ and lys- pts-) did not. lta from lysis-resistant (lys- pts+ and lys- pts-) cells grown with glucose and 2dg also prevented 2dg-dependent lysis of the wild-type. lta could not inhibit degradation of cell walls isolated  from 2dg-grown cultures, but lta inhibited the lysis of micrococcus lysodeikticus (micrococcus luteus) cells that were exposed to supernatants from 2dg-grown s. bovis cultures. group d streptococci (including s. bovis) normally have an alpha-1,2 linked glucose disaccharide (kojibiose) in their lta, but kojibiose cannot be synthesized from 2dg. this observation suggested that the kojibiose moiety of lta was involved in autolysin inactivation. wild-type s. bovis had atp- as well as pep-dependent mechanisms of 2dg phosphorylation and one lysis-resistant phenotype (lys- pts-) had reduced levels of both activities. however, the lys- pts+ phenotype was still able to phosphorylate 2dg via atp and  pep and this result indicated that some other step of 2dg incorporation into lta  was being inhibited. based on these results, growth in the presence of 2dg appears to prevent synthesis of normal lta, which is involved in the regulation of autolytic enzymes.

AB  == a recombinant plasmid capable of restoring uv resistance to an escherichia coli uvrb mutant was isolated from a genomic library of neisseria gonorrhoeae. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence displayed significant similarity to those of the uvrb proteins of e. coli, micrococcus luteus, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a gonococcal uvrb mutant  was constructed and found to be extremely sensitive to uv radiation. transcriptional fusions between portions of the gonococcal uvrb upstream region and a reporter gene were used to localize promoter activity, and the transcriptional start point of the gonococcal uvrb gene was mapped in e. coli by  primer extension. a corresponding sigma 70 promoter was identified within a copy  of the 26-bp neisserial repeat, and this identification provided the first evidence of a promoter associated with this repetitive element in n. gonorrhoeae.

TI  == tissue distribution of antibiotics in the intervertebral disc.
AB  == study design: this study analyzed the distribution of antibiotics within the intervertebral disc of rabbits. specimens were tested with specific antibodies against antibiotics using an immunofluorescent technique. objectives: the results were correlated to provide a rationale for perioperative prophylaxis of infection. summary of background data: several groups of investigators and the recent data from our laboratory showed quantitative changes in penetration of antibiotics into intervertebral disc. no previous study has assessed antibiotic distribution in anulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus. methods: discs were obtained from rabbits after intravenous injection of penicillin or gentamicin. antibiotics were localized in tissue sections using specific antibodies with a immunofluorescent method. results: penicillin (negatively charged) and gentamicin (positively charged) penetrated the neutrally charged anulus fibrosus, but penicillin had less ability than gentamicin to penetrate into the negatively charged nucleus pulposus. conclusion: our data suggest that penetration and distribution of antibiotics into avascular intervertebral disc is significantly influenced by the charge of antibiotics.

TI  == a rapid method to quantify bacterial contamination on hatching eggs. 1. correlation of optical density with initial bacterial count.
AB  == the use of optical-density (od) readings after a 6-h incubation period, as a suitable method to quantify the bacterial contamination on hatching eggs, was established by the use of pure cultures of five bacterial isolates found to be the most prevalent on the hatching eggs examined. these isolates were identified  as micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus gallinarum, streptococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas cepacei and bacillus cereus. it was established that the od reading was repeatable when the same inoculum was used to inoculate five different cultures, which were incubated for 6 h at 37 degrees c. this repeatability was not affected by bacterial isolate, or bacterial concentration of the inoculum, or when mixed bacterial cultures were used. a direct relationship was established between the od reading (at 540 nm) after 6 h and the log of the bacterial concentration at the start of incubation. the od reading after 6 h of incubation  is a repeatable, rapid and simple method to quantify the bacterial concentration  at the start of the incubation period.

TI  == characterization of microbial flora of leprous ulcers infested with maggots.
AB  == swabs from 64 maggot infested leprosy ulcers before and after treatment for maggots and 100 non-infested leprosy ulcers were studied for the bacterial flora. from maggot infested ulcers (before treatment), the cultures usually showed mixed growth. among the gram positive isolates, staphylococcus aureus (37%), s. albus (18%) and streptococcus pyogenes (36%) were frequently isolated. gram negative bacteria isolated were proteus spp. (21%) and escherichia coli (7%). anaerobic bacteria isolated were micrococcus (3%) and bacteroides (4%). after treatment of  maggot infested ulcers, s. aureus (36%) continued to be isolated with almost the  same frequency. the isolates of other gram negative organisms were slightly reduced. among the gram negatives the proteus spp. (10%) were also less in number. in few cases neisseria (3%) was found. anaerobic isolates were m. luteus  (2%) and b. necrophorus (3%). from the cases without maggot infestation, a single organism was isolated from 16 cases and 84 mixed cultures were obtained. isolates included the aerobic gram positives s. aureus (46%), s. albus (21%) and s. pyogenes (38%), and the gram negative proteus spp. (19%) and e. coli (7%). the anaerobic isolate was m. luteus (3%). from this study no apparent association between the type of bacterial flora and maggot infestation could be observed.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

TI  == structure of the gene complementing uvr-402 in streptococcus pneumoniae: homology with escherichia coli uvrb and the homologous gene in micrococcus luteus.
AB  == the repair ability for uv-induced damage observed for streptococcus pneumoniae proceeds through a system similar to the uvr-dependent system in escherichia coli. the dna sequence of a gene complementing uvr-402, a mutation conferring uv  sensitivity, was determined. alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed an extensive sequence homology of 55% with the uvrb protein of e. coli and 59% with the uvrb-homologous protein of micrococcus luteus. nucleotide-binding site consensus was observed. the high conservation of the uvrb-like gene among these three species suggests that the role of the uvrb protein and excision repair in general might be very important for cell survival.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp.

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

AB  == data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin g10x, a preparation of lytic enzymes from bacillus subtilis sk-52 are presented. lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. when it was used as a  substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in b. brevis, b. cereus, b. pumilis, b. subtilis and s. faecalis. preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. sometimes the increase was very high (b. sphaericus, b. subtilis 720, e. coli k12 and mre-600). such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (b. cereus 1312, c. renale, m. luteus, s. aureus kp, 800, 805 and 126001, s. pyogenes 291). an increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. however, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with  its 10 times higher doses. an increase in the lysis level was also achieved with  increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. its use in veterinary was a success.

AB  == although the biological role of many bacterial repair genes is known, there is still an interest in evaluating the capacity of repair pyrimidine dimers in some  strains. for this purpose, we have developed a rapid assay. cells bearing a plasmid are uv irradiated and incubated to allow recovery. the plasmid dna is extracted, purified and treated with uv endonuclease from micrococcus luteus that specifically produces single strand breaks at the site of pyrimidine dimers. the  amount of open circular and covalently closed circular forms of the plasmid dna after treatment and post-incubation provides an estimate of the repair capability of the host strain. the wild type strain and the uvra mutant of escherichia coli  were used to adjust the assay. the lexa mutant of e. coli has been tested and its repair capability is equivalent to that of wild-type strain. the assay has been extended to streptococcus pneumoniae, which is naturally deficient in photoreactivation and sos-like functions. this strain is efficient in the repair  of pyrimidine dimers, formed after uv irradiation.

AB  == the peptide antibiotic nisin was shown to cause a rapid efflux of amino acids and rb+ from the cytoplasm of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus cohnii 22, bacillus subtilis w 23, micrococcus luteus atcc 4698, and streptococcus zymogenes 24). it strongly decreased the membrane potential of cells as judged by the distribution of the lipophilic tetraphenylphosphonium cation. ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate-driven transport of l-proline by cytoplasmic membrane vesicles was blocked after addition of nisin, and accumulated amino acids were released from the vesicles. soybean phospholipid (asolectin) vesicles were not affected by nisin. the data suggest that the cytoplasmic membrane is the primary target and that membrane disruption accounts for the bactericidal action of nisin.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == [antifungal and antimicrobial activity of beta-ionone and vitamin a derivatives].
AB  == the antifungal and antimicrobic activity of some derivatives of beta-ionon and vitamin a was studied. these compounds (citral, pseudo-ionon. beta-ionon aldehyde c14, ketone c18 and its derivatives--4,18-diketone, alcohol c18, semicarbazide ketone c18), as well as vitamin a and its derivatives--retinal, acetate, retinoic acid--differ in composition, structure and substituents of c-atoms in beta-ionon  ring and in polyenoic chain. fusarium solani, botrytis cenerea and verticillum dahliae ii, race 447 were used as test organisms when studying the antifungal activity. when studying the antimicrobic activity, ketone c18 and alcohol c18 were tested using the museum strains staphylococcus aureus 209 p, hemolytic streptococcus pyogenes ff-38, streptococcus sp. tom-1606, micrococcus luteus 2665, as well as the strains staphylococcus aureus isolated from pyoderma patients. the antifungal activity was determined by inhibition of spore germination, and the antimicrobic activity--by the value of areas of growth inhibition of the test organisms on the agar medium. all the compounds mentioned  above possessed the antifungal activity against all the phytopathogenes used. the degree of this activity depends on the composition and structure of both the cyclic part and polyenoic chain. on the number of conjugated unsaturations, substituents and end groups of c-atom. ketone c18 is the most active one. it inhibits spore germination by 100-94% at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.005% and 24 h exposure, and by 100% at the concentration of 0.1% and 72 h exposure. alcohol c18 possesses almost the same antifungul activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  == primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. after sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination  of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria escherichia coli k 12 and staphylococcus aureus sg 511. microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. the following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with candida albicans). 2. cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. only one semen sample was  contaminated with bacteria (staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and streptococcus  nonhaemolyticus). non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.

TI  == messenger rna from allotype-defined rabbits directing the cell-free synthesis of  immunoglobulin heavy and light chains.
AB  == in vitro synthesis studies were performed utilizing polya(+)-rna and lymphocytes  from the spleens of rabbits hyperimmunized with micrococcus luteus or streptococcus pneumoniae (type iii). polya(+)-rna isolated after 4 m guanidinium  thiocyanate extraction and oligo(dt)-selection appeared to be undegraded on ch3hgoh-agarose gel electrophoresis and demonstrated biological activity when translated in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. the electrophoretic patterns of the specifically immunoprecipitated cell-free products were compared  with those of nonidet-p40 extracts (lysates) and secretions (supernatants) from rabbit spleen lymphocyte cultures and serum proteins. kappa light chains with specific b allotypes, as well as immunoglobulin heavy chains, were identified. the efficient translation of mrna of defined allotypes was a necessary prerequisite for production of characterized cdna clones and identification of genomic sequences for rabbit immunoglobulin heavy and light chains.

TI  == biosynthesis of ribothymidine in the transfer rna of streptococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis. a methylation of rna involving 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.
AB  == the methyl moiety of ribothymidine in the trna of streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and probably bacillus cereus is dervied from a 1-carbon folate derivative and not s-adenosylmethionine. micrococcus luteus (m. lysodeikticus) trna appears to be almost devoid of ribothymidine. s. faecalis trna lacking ribothymidine can be methylated in vitro with formation of ribothymidine. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate has been identified as the 1-carbon donor involved in ribothymidine formation in s. faecalis and implicated in the analogous reaction in b. subtilis. the reaction requires fadh2 and/or another reducing agent present in cell extracts for the reduction of the methylene moiety.

TI  == [bacterial flora of the conjunctival sac of the horse].
AB  == the aa. report the results of taxonomic research conducted on the conjunctival sac of 59 horses for identification of the present bacterial flora. in the controlled animals, it was observed, at the level of the considered niche, a community constituted of normal bacterial populations, but not autochtonous in the significance they attributed from dubos et al., relative to the characterization of the indigenous microbiota of the intestine. the isolated normal bacterial flora seems to be constituted of: micrococcus (subgroup 6 of baird-parker, m. luteus, micrococcus spp.) isolated in 49,15% of the samples; staphylococcus aureus and st. epidermidis (18,64%); moraxella osloensis, m. phenylpiruvica, m. equi and moraxella spp. (11,86%); bacillus cereus (11,86%); neisseria catarrhalis (8,47%); streptococcus equi and str. zooepidemicus (6,77%); corynebacterium spp. (6,77%) and acinetobacter lwoffi (5,08%). the aa. have found, besides, a particular group of bacteria of uncertain classification, attributed to the coryneforms and found in 30,50% of the examined horses. so-called transient bacteria taxa have been considered are streptomyces spp., isolated in the 10,16% of the controlled subjects, aerococcus viridans and bacillus spp. found in only one equine.

TI  == competitive inhibition of transformation in group h streptococcus strain challis  by heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid.
AB  == glucosylated deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) from phages t4 and t6 competes poorly with homologous dna causing only a slight decrease of transformation in group h streptococcus strain challis. other types of heterologous dnas (micrococcus luteus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, calf thymus and non-glucosylated phage t6 dna), in contrast to glucosylated t4 and t6 dnas, compete with transforming dna to the normal, high extent. these results indicate  that as in transformation of bacillus subtilis, the presence of glucose attached  to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in phage t6 dna considerably decreases the interaction of such dna with competent cells of the challis strain. it also indicates that the guanine plus cytosine content of dna is not decisive in determining its interaction with competent cells.
