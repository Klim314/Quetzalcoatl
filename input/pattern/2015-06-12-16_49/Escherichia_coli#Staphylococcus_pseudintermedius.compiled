TI  - The distribution of pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among canine surgical wound infections in Sweden in relation to different risk factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common nosocomial infection in dogs and a growing concern in veterinary hospitals as an increase in multidrug-resistant pathogens is reported. Despite the need for rational and prudent antimicrobial use, few peer-reviewed and published veterinary studies have investigated the pathogenic growth including susceptibility patterns of the isolated pathogens in canine SSIs. The first objective of the present study was to estimate the distribution of bacterial pathogens in dogs with SSI and to investigate whether this was influenced by type of surgical procedure (clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated or dirty), duration of hospitalization, wound classification and depth of the infection, or antimicrobial treatment. The second objective was to assess susceptibility patterns to clinically relevant antimicrobials. During three years, four animal referral hospitals and three small animal clinics submitted bacterial swabs from canine SSIs for culture and susceptibility, together with a questionnaire completed by the attending clinician. RESULTS: Approximately two thirds of the in total 194 isolates were staphylococci. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was the most prevalent finding (46%) followed by beta haemolytic Streptococcus spp. (24%). No associations between distribution of the isolated pathogens and classification of the surgical procedure, duration of hospitalization or depth of the SSI were shown, with the exception of Escherichia coli isolates being significantly more often found in deep wound infections than in superficial skin infections. Overall the possibilities of finding first generations antimicrobials to treat the SSIs included in the study were favorable, as the isolated pathogens were mostly without acquired antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistance was uncommon. There were only three cases of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius-infections (one percent of all isolates), one case of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli-infection, and no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. CONCLUSIONS: None of the investigated factors were shown to influence the distribution of bacterial pathogens. The majority of SSIs were caused by staphylococci, and S. pseudintermedius was the most prevalent pathogen. Based on the study results, use of first-line antimicrobials prior to receiving culture and susceptibility results is a rational empirical antimicrobial therapy for the studied dog population.
TI  - Characterisation of bacterial growth and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in canine urinary tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common reason for antimicrobial therapy in dogs. A reported increase in multi-drug resistance in canine bacterial pathogens, including resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) is of concern as antimicrobial resistance complicates therapy in dogs. In addition, it is a possible public health concern. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relative prevalence of pathogens in urine samples from dogs with urinary tract infection sampled at referral hospitals, clinics and mixed veterinary practices and to investigate if this was influenced by sample material or by contamination of the culture. The second objective was to assess the susceptibility patterns to clinically relevant antimicrobials and to investigate if this was influenced by whether the samples originated from smaller clinics or from referral hospitals and to perform active screening for the presence of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to ESC. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen (68%) followed by staphylococci (11%). E. coli isolates were found significantly more often in pure culture than in contaminated samples. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were significantly more prevalent in pre-incubated samples compared to samples submitted as non-incubated media. Susceptibility to the majority of the tested first-line antimicrobials was common. Multiresistance was rare, and these isolates were all susceptible to at least one relevant antimicrobial. Isolates in samples from small animal clinics or mixed veterinary practices were less likely to be susceptible compared to isolates originating from referral animal hospitals. ESC-resistant Enterobacteriacae isolates were found in one per cent of the positive cultures. Bacteria with transferable ESC resistance were confirmed in one dog. The gene demonstrated was bla CMY2. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of sample material might influence the possibility of detecting Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus isolates in clinical cases of UTI in dogs. Based on the study results, use of first-line antimicrobials is a rational empirical antimicrobial therapy for the studied dog population. E. coli was the most prevalent pathogen, but prevalence of infection with ESC resistant Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli was low, as such isolates were found in only one per cent of the positive cultures.
TI  - Canine antimicrobial peptides are effective against resistant bacteria and yeasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins present in most living species and they are involved in the defence against pathogenic organisms. beta-Defensins and cathelicidin are the most frequently studied AMPs in both people and dogs. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of two canine beta-defensins and a cathelicidin against antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and yeasts using a broth microdilution method. METHODS: The micro-organisms tested were ATCC strains of meticillin-sensitive and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively), meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MSSP), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Malassezia pachydermatis. Field strains of meticillin-resistant S, pseudintermedius (MRSP, n = 1) and MSSP (n = 11) were also tested. Mann-Whitney U-test and Friedman test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The MSSP and MRSP were more susceptible to canine AMPs than MSSA and MRSA. Malassezia pachydermatis was more sensitive than C. albicans to canine AMPs. The beta-defensin cBD103 was most effective against Staphylococci and P. aeruginosa, while the cathelicidin cCath was the most effective AMP against E. coli. Additionally, cBD103 was the most effective AMP for both yeasts studied, with M. pachydermatis being more susceptible than C. albicans. All AMPs tested exhibited killing within 2 h of exposure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We demonstrated that natural canine AMPs are effective against canine-specific pathogens, are equally effective against meticillin-resistant or -susceptible strains, and are more effective against M. pachydermatis than against C. albicans organisms.
TI  - The joint in vitro action of polymyxin B and miconazole against pathogens associated with canine otitis externa from three European countries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Canine otitis externa, an inflammation of the external ear canal, can be maintained and worsened by bacterial or fungal infections. For topical treatment, combinations of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial ingredients are mainly used. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to elucidate the in vitro activity of polymyxin B and miconazole against clinical bacterial isolates from three European countries, to investigate possible differences in sensitivity and to assess drug interactions. ANIMALS: Seventeen strains of Escherichia coli, 24 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 24 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 25 strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs with diagnosed otitis externa had been isolated in Germany, France and Italy. METHODS: Drug activities were evaluated by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration. The potentiation of polymyxin B plus miconazole was calculated using the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI). An FICI </=0.5 defined synergy. Furthermore, geographical variations in the FICI and MIC were assessed by statistical analysis. RESULTS: Bacterial susceptibilities were comparable in different European countries, because there were no significant MIC and FICI variations (P > 0.05). As a single agent, polymyxin B had bactericidal activity against most E. coli and P. aeruginosa strains and, in higher concentrations, against S. pseudintermedius strains. Miconazole was bactericidal against all Staphylococcus strains. Synergy was demonstrated against strains of E. coli and P. aeruginosa (FICI = 0.25 and 0.50, respectively), whereas overall there was no interaction against S. pseudintermedius strains (FICI = 1.25). Proteus mirabilis strains were not inhibited by each of the drugs individually or by their combination. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In vitro synergy of polymyxin B and miconazole against E. coli and P. aeruginosa isolates indicates a rationale for applying both agents in combination to treat otitis externa when infected with these types of bacteria.
TI  - Mutant prevention concentration of orbifloxacin: comparison between Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius of canine origin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) is an important parameter to evaluate the likelihood of growth of fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants for antimicrobial-pathogen combinations. The MPCs of fluoroquinolones for different canine pathogens have not been compared. In this study, we compared for the first time orbifloxacin MPCs between susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius of canine origin. METHODS: More than 1010 CFU/ml of 10 strains of each bacterial species were inoculated onto Muller-Hinton agar supplemented with different concentrations of orbifloxacin from 1x to 64x minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the MPCs were recorded. MICs of original strains and of mutants arising after exposure to sub-MPC concentrations (one per original strain) were determined in the presence or absence of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs). The effects of quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations were also examined. RESULTS: MPCs were significantly higher for P. aeruginosa (16-128 mug/ml) than for E. coli (0.5-32 mug/ml). MPCs for S. pseudintermedius varied between the low-susceptible (16-128 mug/ml) and the high-susceptible strains (4-16 mug/ml) and were the most broadly distributed among the three species. Regarding resistance mechanisms, only one QRDR mutation in gyrA was found in all of the 10 mutants of E. coli and in 4 of the 10 mutants of P. aeruginosa, whereas mutations in both grlA and gyrA were found in 3 mutants and one mutation in grlA was found in 2 mutants among the 10 mutants of S. pseudintermedius. In the presence of an EPI, the MICs of P. aeruginosa mutants decreased markedly, those of E. coli mutants decreased moderately, and those of S. pseudintermedius mutants were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: MPCs of orbifloxacin vary between bacterial species of canine pathogens, possibly due to the diversity of the main fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism among these species. Therefore, the type of bacterial species should be taken into consideration when using fluoroquinolone drugs such as orbifloxacin in canines.
TI  - Identification and antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates from dogs with otitis externa in Australia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and quantify the five most frequently isolated significant bacterial microorganisms, and their antibiotic susceptibility, from bacterial cultures of samples taken from the ears of dogs with otitis externa. METHODS: Bacterial culture and susceptibility testing data for ear swabs from dogs with presumed otitis externa were collated and evaluated. RESULTS: The five most frequently isolated microorganisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Proteus sp., beta-haemolytic streptococci and Escherichia coli. Susceptibility to gentamicin was very high for most isolates, whereas for polymyxin B, high levels of resistance were seen. Beta-haemolytic streptococci had high levels of resistance to all of the antibiotics tested. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides veterinarians with Australian data to assist in cytological interpretation and initial empirical therapy of canine otitis externa.
TI  - Susceptibility of canine and feline bacterial pathogens to pradofloxacin and comparison with other fluoroquinolones approved for companion animals.
AB  - In this study, 908 bacterial pathogens from defined infections of dogs and cats were tested for their susceptibility to the novel fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin, which was approved in 2011 for use in cats and dogs. Most of the bacteria tested (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica) exhibited low pradofloxacin MIC(90) values of </= 0.25 mug/ml. Solely Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had higher MIC(90) values of >/= 4 mug/ml. Only six (3.4%) of 177 S. pseudintermedius and 12 (5.3%) of 227 E. coli isolates showed pradofloxacin MICs of >/= 2 mug/ml. Analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of the target genes identified double mutations in GyrA that resulted in amino acid exchanges S83L+D87N or S83L+D87Y and single or double mutations in ParC that resulted in amino acid exchanges S80I or S80I+E84G in all 12 E. coli isolates. The six S. pseudintermedius isolates exhibited amino acid exchanges S84L or E88K in GyrA and S80I in GrlA. Comparative analysis of the MICs of pradofloxacin and the MICs determined for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin, but also marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin and ibafloxacin was conducted for the target pathogens S. pseudintermedius, E. coli and P. multocida. This comparison confirmed that pradofloxacin MICs were significantly lower than those of the other tested fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from breeding dogs housed in kennels with differing neonatal mortality and use of antibiotics.
AB  - This work examines the antimicrobial resistance of potentially pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Streptococcus canis, Escherichia coli) found in the vaginal tract in prepartum mammary secretions and postpartum milk of bitches housed in breeding kennels (N = 20; 92 bitches). The kennels were divided into three categories: no routine antimicrobial administration around parturition (category 1); routine administration of one antibiotic around parturition (category 2); routine administration of multiple antimicrobials around parturition (category 3). Bacteriological cultures and antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on vaginal specimens, prepartum mammary secretions, and postpartum milk. Stillbirths and neonatal deaths were recorded for each whelping and analyzed as "within-litter stillbirths" and "within-litter neonatal deaths" according to kennel category, by Pearson chi(2) test and the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test, respectively. The frequency of isolation and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria were analyzed according to kennel category by Pearson chi(2) test. Kennel category was not significantly associated with differing numbers of stillbirths or neonatal death events, nor was the frequency of isolation of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the three kennel categories significantly different. Kennel category 3 had a significantly higher frequency of isolation of multiresistant gram-positive bacterial strains. Our results show that intense administration of antibiotics to breeding bitches does not effectively reduce neonatal mortality; on the contrary, it induces multiresistance in potentially pathogenic bacteria. Breeders and veterinarians should be aware of the risk of selecting pathogenic bacteria by uncontrolled treatment in prepartum bitches.
TI  - The in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates from  dogs.
AB  - The in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella spp. and Streptococcus canis from dogs was investigated. For Staphylococcus spp., the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin, followed by ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. The highest frequency of resistance in E. coli isolates was recorded for tetracycline and streptomycin. Pasteurella spp. and S. canis had the highest resistance rate for tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Most isolates showed full susceptibility to low-level resistance to colistin, florfenicol and fluoroquinolones. Further studies using larger number of isolates from both healthy and diseased dogs would provide a broader picture of antimicrobial resistance at a national level and promote prudent use of antimicrobial agents in companion animals.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  - Pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., Fusobacterium spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella species. A subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. For 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin MBC was within two doubling dilutions of the MIC. For the remaining strains, the MIC and MBC were within three to four doubling dilutions. Pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the MBC was equal to the MIC for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. As pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/mL. The bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as low as 0.125 mug/mL. In conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of MBC and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. It is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. These data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.
TI  - In vitro killing of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by enrofloxacin in combination with its active metabolite ciprofloxacin using clinically relevant drug concentrations in the dog and cat.
AB  - Enrofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent used to treat infections in companion animals. Enrofloxacin's antimicrobial spectrum includes Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria and demonstrates concentration-dependent bacteriocidal activity. In dogs and cats, enrofloxacin is partially metabolized to ciprofloxacin and both active agents circulate simultaneously in treated animals at ratios of approximately 60-70% enrofloxacin to 30-40% ciprofloxacin. We were interested in determining the killing of companion animal isolates of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin combined using clinically relevant drug concentrations and ratios. For E. coli isolates exposed to 2.1 and 4.1mug/ml of enrofloxacin/ciprofloxacin at 50:50, 60:40 and 70:30 ratios, a 1.7-2.5log(10) reduction (94-99% kill) was seen following 20min of drug exposure; 0.89-1.7log(10) (92-99% kill) of S. pseudintermedius following 180min of drug exposure; 0.85-3.4log(10) (98-99% kill) of P. aeruginosa following 15min of drug exposure. Killing of S. pseudintermedius was enhanced in the presence of enrofloxacin whereas killing of P. aeruginosa was enhanced in the presence of ciprofloxacin. Antagonism was not seen when enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used in kill assays. The unique feature of partial metabolism of enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin expands the spectrum of enhanced killing of common companion animal pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of nitrofurantoin against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from dogs and cats.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of nitrofurantoin were determined by agar dilution in 269 canine and feline isolates of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, two of the most common bacterial species associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in small animals. The MIC90 for E. coli and S. pseudintermedius were 32 and 16 mug/ml, respectively. All isolates, including multidrug-resistant strains of known genetic background, displayed MICs below the drug concentrations reported in canine urine following oral administration of nitrofurantoin. Preliminary data on mutant prevention concentration (MPC) and many years of nitrofurantoin usage in human medicine suggest that emergence of resistant mutants during treatment is not a critical issue for this drug. The study provides species-specific data on nitrofurantoin MIC distribution that can be used for setting dog- and cat-specific breakpoints. Although nitrofurantoin is not an appropriate first-line agent for empirical treatment of canine UTI due to toxicity and poor pharmacokinetic properties, it may be indicated for treatment of UTI caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which are otherwise difficult to treat using conventional veterinary antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius exfoliative toxin EXI selectively digests canine  desmoglein 1 and causes subcorneal clefts in canine epidermis.
AB  - Staphylococcal exfoliative toxins are known to digest desmoglein (Dsg) 1, a desmosomal cell-cell adhesion molecule, thus causing intraepidermal splitting in human bullous impetigo, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and swine exudative epidermitis. Recently, a novel exfoliative toxin gene (exi), whose sequence shares significant homology with previously identified exfoliative toxins, was isolated from Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Little is known about the pathogenic involvement of this toxin in canine pustular diseases such as impetigo. The aim of this study was to determine whether EXI, the product of the exi gene, digests canine Dsg1 and causes intraepidermal splitting in canine skin. An exi gene was isolated from chromosomal DNA of an S. pseudintermedius strain obtained from a pustule of a dog with impetigo, and was used to produce a recombinant EXI by Escherichia coli expression. When purified recombinant EXI was injected intradermally into normal dogs, it caused the development of vesicles or erosions with superficial epidermal splitting. In addition, the EXI abolished immunofluorescence for Dsg1, but not for Dsg3, at the injection sites. Moreover, the EXI directly degraded baculovirus-secreted recombinant extracellular domains of canine Dsg1, but not that of canine Dsg3, in vitro. The EXI also degraded mouse Dsg1alpha and swine Dsg1, but not human Dsg1, mouse Dsg1beta and Dsg1gamma. Conversely, recombinant SIET, previously designated as S. intermedius exfoliative toxin, did not cause intraepidermal splitting or degradation of any Dsgs. These findings indicate that EXI has a proteolytic activity that digests canine Dsg1, and this characteristic might be involved in the pathogenesis of intraepidermal splitting in canine impetigo.
TI  - Escherichia coli and selected veterinary and zoonotic pathogens isolated from environmental sites in companion animal veterinary hospitals in southern Ontario.
AB  - Hospital-based infection control in veterinary medicine is emerging and the role  of the environment in hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in veterinary hospitals is largely unknown. This study was initiated to determine the recovery of Escherichia coli and selected veterinary and zoonotic pathogens from the environments of 101 community veterinary hospitals. The proportion of hospitals with positive environmental swabs were: E. coli--92%, Clostridium difficile--58%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)--9%, CMY-2 producing E. coli--9%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius--7%, and Salmonella--2%. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., canine parvovirus, and feline calicivirus were not isolated. Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates was low. Important potential veterinary and human pathogens were recovered including Canadian epidemic strains MRSA-2 and MRSA-5, and C. difficile ribotype 027. There is an environmental reservoir of pathogens in veterinary hospitals; therefore, additional studies are required to characterize risk factors associated with HAI in companion animals, including the role of the environment.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in Grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  - In a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in Grenada, West Indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth, nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. A total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to species level and 46 to genus level. A commercial bacterial identification system (API/Biomerieux), was used for this purpose. The most common species was Escherichia coli (N=60), followed by Staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), S. hominis (16), S. haemolyticus (12), Streptococcus canis (9), Proteus mirabilis (8), Pasteurella multocida (7), Streptococcus mitis (7), Staphylococcus xylosus (7), S. capitis (6), S. chromogenes (4), S. sciuri (3), S. auricularis (2), S. lentus (2), S. hyicus (2), Streptococcus suis (2) and Pseudomonas argentinensis (2). Sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. A molecular method using 16S rRNA sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. Salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. E. coli and S. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. S. felis/simulans was the most common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. P. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. Staphylococcus aureus, or S. intemedius/S. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. Antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested against, including tetracycline.
TI  - Recognising and controlling risk factors for antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance amongst organisms such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and S. pseudintermedius has become a serious threat to veterinary small animal practice. There is an urgent need to adopt measures which will control and reduce this problem. Risk factors for infection by resistant organisms in small animals are now becoming recognised and appear to mirror those in human medicine. They include contact with carriers or infected animals, hospital admission, invasive procedures and antimicrobial therapy. Key recommendations which enable such risk factors to be avoided are: development of protocols which ensure that antimicrobials are used only when necessary, selection of appropriate antimicrobials and compliance with correct dosage and administration, limitation of prophylactic and perioperative use, and recording of treatment outcomes so that therapeutic regimens can be evaluated and modified if necessary. In addition, there is a need for rigorous hygiene protocols to prevent survival and transfer of resistant bacteria in clinics and hospitals.
TI  - Occurrence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in healthy dogs and cats presented to private veterinary hospitals in southern Ontario: A preliminary study.
AB  - The prevalence and patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility of fecal Escherichia  coli, Salmonella spp., extended beta-lactamase producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) were determined for healthy dogs (n = 188) and cats (n = 39) from veterinary hospitals in southern Ontario that had not had recent exposure to antimicrobials. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli was as follows: streptomycin (dogs - 17%, cats - 2%), ampicillin (dogs - 13%, cats - 4%), cephalothin (dogs - 13%, cats - < 1%), and tetracycline (dogs - 11%, cats - 2%). Eleven percent of dogs and 15% of cats had isolates that were resistant to at least 2 antimicrobials. Cephamycinase (CMY)-2 producing E. coli was cultured from 2 dogs. No Salmonella spp., ESBL-E. coli, MRSA, or MRSP isolates were recovered. The observed prevalence of resistance in commensal E. coli from this population was lower than that previously reported in companion animals, but a small percentage of dogs may be a reservoir for CMY-2 E. coli.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and Tris-EDTA.
AB  - Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and Tris-EDTA (Otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated with canine otitis. The microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. The most susceptible group included Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Malassezia pachydermatis, Streptococcus canis and Corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (MBC = 23/0.8 microg/mL of chlorhexidine/Tris-EDTA). The most resistant organism was Proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (MBC = 375/12 microg/mL). Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate MBCs ranging between 188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/mL. Interestingly, S. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than S. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. Although the concentrations required for killing (MBCs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and Tris-EDTA was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.
