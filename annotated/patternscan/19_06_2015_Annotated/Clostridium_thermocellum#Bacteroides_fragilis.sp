TI  == the correlation between clostridium-difficile infection and human gut concentrations of bacteroidetes phylum and clostridial species.
AB  == we aimed to assess differences in bacterial intensities of bacteroidetes phylum and different clostridial species in the human intestines with respect to c. difficile infection. patients with a stool assay for c. difficile toxin were identified via the microbiology laboratory in our institute. bacterial populations were quantified from stool samples of four groups of patients: group  i-patients with c. difficile associated diarrhea (cdad); group ii-asymptomatic c. difficile carriers; group iii-patients with non-c. difficile diarrhea; group iv-patients with no diarrhea and negative stool samples for the c. difficile toxin (control group). stool was examined for three genes-c. difficile toxin a gene, 16s rrna gene from clostridium thermocellum representing other clostridial  species, and 16s rrna gene from bacteroides fragilis representing the bacteroidetes phylum. fifty-nine patients underwent analysis of the stool (cdad group 14, carriers group 14, non-c. difficile diarrhea group 16, control group 15). c. difficile concentration was highest in the cdad group, followed by the carriers group. higher concentrations of both clostridial species and bacteriodetes were observed in the control and non-c. difficile diarrhea groups compared to the cdad and carriers groups. we demonstrated an inverse association  between infection with c. difficile and the abundance of bacteroidetes phylum and other clostridial species in human intestines. studies with larger samples and broader diagnostic procedures are needed in order to better explore and understand this association.

TI  == dual diaminopimelate biosynthesis pathways in bacteroides fragilis and clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == bacteroides fragilis and clostridium thermocellum were recently found to synthesize diaminopimelate (dap) by way of ll-dap aminotransferase. both species  also contain an ortholog of meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase (ddh), suggesting  that they may have redundant pathways for dap biosynthesis. the b. fragilis ddh ortholog shows low homology with other examples of ddh and this species belongs to a phylum, the bacteriodetes, not previously known to contain this enzyme. by contrast, the c. thermocellum ortholog is well conserved with known examples of ddh. using in vitro and in vivo assays both the b. fragilis and c. thermocellum enzymes were found to be authentic examples of ddh, displaying kinetic properties typical of this enzyme. the result indicates that b. fragilis contains a sequence diverged form of ddh. phylogenomic analysis of the microbial genome database revealed that 77% of species with a ddh ortholog also contain a second pathway for dap biosynthesis suggesting that ddh evolved as an ancillary mechanism for dap biosynthesis.
