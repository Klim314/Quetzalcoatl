TI  - [Analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy Chinese women by using DNA-fingerprinting].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to Chinese females. METHODS: Women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in Peking University First Hospital from October 2009 to January 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. Vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the V3 region of 16S rDNA gene. PCR products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Featured bands on DGGE were recovered, cloned and sequenced. Alignment with known sequence was made by using Blast on GenBank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in different physiological states. RESULTS: (1) Vaginal flora in healthy Chinese women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, Lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. While L. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) Vaginal bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Veillonella sp., Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus, Prevotella sp., Anaerococcus lactolyticus and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSION: Based on the DGGE analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in Chinese healthy women at reproductive age are Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.,Bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing Veillonella sp. and Anaerococcus lactolyticus. Meanwhile Lactobacillus iners was firstly found by DGGE to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.
TI  - Microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. METHODS: Bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed OLP from the Stomatology Service, Department of Oral Surgery and Stomatology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. Samples were taken from OLP lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. The control population did not have OLP and was recruited from the student clinic. All samples were processed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. RESULTS: Significantly higher bacterial counts of Bacteroides ureolyticus (P = 0.001), Dialister species (sp.) (P = 0.006), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (P = 0.007), and Streptococcus agalactiae (P = 0.006) were found in samples taken from OLP lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of OLP. Significantly higher bacterial counts were found for Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus crispatus, Mobiluncus curtisii, Neisseria mucosa, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella intermedia, and S. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with OLP compared to sites in control subjects (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Microbiologic differences were found between sites with OLP and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of OLP. Specifically, higher counts of staphylococci and S. agalactiae were found in OLP lesions.
TI  - Heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of Lactobacillus crispatus CHCC3692.
AB  - A 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedTn3692, of the gram-positive strain Lactobacillus crispatus CHCC3692 contains an erm(B) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. Loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. Heat shock treatment at 60 degrees C resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin MIC, 0.047 micrograms/ml). The phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb DNA fragment carrying the erm(B) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. In cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. The upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. Significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from L. crispatus CHCC3692 and the erm(B) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(B) gene for these species. The transposed DNA element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of CHCC3692, as determining by Southern blotting, PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing. No other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. These observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.
