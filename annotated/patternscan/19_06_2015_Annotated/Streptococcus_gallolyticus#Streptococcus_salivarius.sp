TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.
