TI  == detection of airborne bacteria in a duck production facility with two different personal air sampling devices for an exposure assessment.
AB  == prevalent airborne microorganisms are not well characterized in industrial animal production buildings with respect to their quantity or quality. to investigate the work-related microbial exposure, personal bioaerosol sampling during the whole working day is recommended. therefore, bioaerosol sampling in a duck hatchery and a duck house with two personal air sampling devices, a filter-based  pgp and a niosh particle size separator, was performed. subsequent, quantitative  and qualitative analyses were carried out with" culture independent methods. total cell concentrations (tcc) determined via fluorescence microscopy showed no  difference between the two devices. in average, 8 x 10(6) cells/m(3) were determined in the air of the duck hatchery and 5 x 10(7) cells/m(3) in the air of the duck house. a generated restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) pattern revealed deviant bacterial compositions comparing samples collected with  both devices. clone library analyses based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis from the hatchery's air showed 65% similarity between the two sampling devices. detailed 16s rrna gene sequence analyses showed the occurrence of bacterial species like acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia sp., and shigella sp.; and a group of staphylococcus delphini, s. intermedius, and s. pseudintermedius that provided the evidence of potential exposure to risk group 2 bacteria at the hatchery workplace. size fractionated sampling with the developed by the institute for occupational safety and health of the german social accident insurance (ifa) device revealed that pathogenic bacteria would deposit in the inhalable, the thorax, and possibly alveolar dust fraction according to en481. tcc analysis showed the deposition of bacterial cells in the third stage (< 1mum) at the niosh device which implies that bacteria can reach deep into the lungs and contaminate the alveolus after inhalation. nevertheless, both personal sampling devices could be recommended for exposure assessment at agricultural workplaces.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. the spanish group for the study of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. according to the criteria of mccabe and jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. the clinical condition  of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or  good in 28. sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. the causative micro-organisms were: escherichia coli (18 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), salmonella sp. (seven episodes), enterobacter sp. (six episodes), proteus sp. (four episodes), serratia sp. (four episodes), haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), klebsiella sp. (three episodes), staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and morganella morganii (two episodes). overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). five organisms persisted: acinetobacter sp. (two patients), p. aeruginosa (one patient), enterobacter sp. (one patient), and serratia sp. (one patient). side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). superinfecting organisms and sites  were as follows: enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). ciprofloxacin administered either  intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

TI  == serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  == ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl  before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. five strains each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, streptococcus  (enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested.  serum bactericidal activities (sbas) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or  equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, a. calcoaceticus, and k. pneumoniae. l. monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa had lower sbas. very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis. the study of the killing rate in serum  confirmed these results. postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. the duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, a. calcoaceticus, k. pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. m. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. no postantibiotic effect was observed with streptococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and sbas against susceptible pathogens. prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. no signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

TI  == antibacterial activity in vitro and regression studies for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  == the antibacterial activity in vitro of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone was investigated against 575 recent clinical isolates. both cephalosporins displayed  excellent activity against most of the pathogens tested, in particular gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa. apart from the pseudomonas group, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and campylobacter jejuni ceftriaxone was slightly to moderately more active than ceftazidime overall. ceftriaxone was moderately active against streptococcus faecalis. regression lines for the two antibiotics were almost identical. corresponding to differences in susceptibility, the zone sizes differed for the two drugs with respect to certain bacterial groups, e.g. pseudomonas sp. and enterococci. therefore, the two cephalosporins cannot substitute for each other in disc susceptibility testing. breakpoints for disc tests around 8-16 micrograms/ml, as suggested in the literature, appear too high considering the beneficial pharmacokinetic properties of the two drugs.

TI  == interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth by aerobic bacterial representatives of the urogenital flora.
AB  == aerobic bacterial isolates obtained from endocervical, vaginal and urethral swabbings were tested for interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth on solid medium. simultaneous antagonism was studied using the lawn spotting method, and delayed antagonism by the basal spot/lawn method. from 58 swabbings we recuperated a total of 181 isolates, 71 of those were found interfering with at least one out of four gonococcal strains (g-1, g-2, g-3 and g-4). similar percentages of interfering isolates were obtained from each of the isolation sites. the identification of the interfering isolates has revealed that similar numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci and identical numbers of group d streptococci were found for each of those sites. the majority of the interfering  isolates and also of the inhibitory coagulase negative staphylococci showed only  simultaneous antagonism. to complete the interference spectrum, we have tested all the active urogenital isolates against four other gonococcal strains (g-7, g-9, g-10 and g-11). this spectrum showed clearly that interference is not an all or none phenomenon. while the gonococcal interference spectrum of most of the gram positive cocci and the acinetobacter sp. strains is broad, that of all the other isolates is relatively narrow. gonococcal strains g-7 and g-9 were the most susceptible to inhibition by the interfering urogenital isolates while strain g-3 was the most resistant one.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  == cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. this study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc). cefoperazone was highly active against enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive proteus, serratia and  enterobacter sp. particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against pseudomonas and acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. the activity of cefoperazone against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, group d streptococci and haemophilus was also determined. in general, the differences between mic and mbc  were minimal. additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.
