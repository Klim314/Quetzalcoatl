TI  - Pelvic peritonitis during biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis: a case report and review of the literature.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections are recognized as major complications during therapy with biologics and other immunosuppressant drugs. The respiratory tract, bone, joint, skin, and soft tissues are well known sites of infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated by biologics or other immunosuppressants. It is known that patients with intra-abdominal infections may develop tuberculous peritonitis during biologic therapy. However, non-tuberculous pelvic peritonitis is rare. CASE DESCRIPTION: A case of a 46-year-old patient with RA developed pelvic peritonitis during therapy with MTX, tacrolimus (TAC), and golimumab (GLM). The patient visited our hospital due to a fever and general malaise. Physical findings included lower abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) images showed an intrauterine foreign body and ascites. The contraceptive ring was removed. Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus constellatus were cultured from the removed contraceptive ring. She was started on an antimicrobial agent, flomoxef (FMOX), at 2 g/day. The FMOX dosage was increased to 3 g/day from the 3rd day of disease and continued for 10 days. Her fever disappeared from the 4th disease day, and her inflammatory response then gradually decreased. No exacerbation of symptoms occurred even after the FMOX treatment was stopped, and the patient was discharged on the 14th disease day. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: MTX and biologics were being administered at the time of onset of peritonitis. The peritonitis was diagnosed on the basis of the gynecological evaluation and CT imaging findings that were typical of peritonitis. The patient was in an immunosuppressed state during administration of anti-rheumatic drugs, and the peritonitis was thought to have developed due to an ascending infection via the long-term presence of the intrauterine contraceptive ring which had an attached string. CONCLUSIONS: Before starting biological agents, patients must be questioned regarding the presence of an intrauterine foreign body.
TI  - [Investigation on the identification accuracy for group B Streptococcus by automated identification system RAISUS].
AB  - Since we had experienced a case of misidentification for group B Streptococcus (GBS) (Streptococcus agalactiae) by automated identification system RAISUS, we have investigated the identification accuracy for GBS by automated identification system RAISUS system using our stock isolated of GBS. Among 31 strains including standard strain ATCC13813 of GBS, 30 strains were identified as GBS, while only 1 strain was misidentified as Streptococcus constellatus. We have needed 3 hours to identify 29 true GBS strains, while it has taken 6 hours for misidentified strain as S. constellatus. Since we have needed more than 4 hours for our misidentified strain of GBS, the tendency for identification time to become long has been recognized. Longer identification time might be associated with the misidentification. The improvement for galactose and glycerol tests of RAISUS by the manufacturer has resulted in better identification. As for the strains to be identified as S. constellatus by RAISUS, we might re-check it with other identification kits when there is higher clinical necessity.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora isolated from the female genital tract  activates HIV-1 expression.
AB  - Alteration of cervicovaginal microbial flora can lead to vaginosis, which is associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 transmission. We recently characterized a soluble HIV-inducing factor (HIF) from the cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) samples of women. The goals of this study were to determine the effect of cervicovaginal microflora on HIV-1 expression and to elucidate the relationship between HIF activity and microflora. Physiologically relevant microorganisms, Mycoplasma, diphtheroid-like bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus constellatus, cultured from the CVL of a representative woman with a clinical condition of bacterial vaginosis and possessing HIF activity, induced HIV-1 expression. The magnitude of virus induction varied widely with the greatest stimulation induced by diphtheroid-like bacteria and Mycoplasma. The transcriptional induction by Mycoplasma was mediated by activation of the KB enhancer, an activation mechanism shared with HIF. Also as with HIF, Mycoplasma induced AP-1 dependent transcription. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based speciation showed that the isolate was M. hominis. Our data indicate that bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora can enhance HIV-1 transcription and replication and identify M. hominis as a potential source for HIF activity. The virus-enhancing activities associated with the microflora and HIF may increase genital tract viral load, potentially contributing to HIV transmission.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Characterization of the Lancefield group C streptococcus 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacer and its potential for identification and sub-specific typing.
AB  - The 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacers of isolates of Streptococcus equi (n = 5), S. zooepidemicus (n = 5), S. equisimilis (n = 3) and S. dysgalactiae (n = 2) were sequenced and compared. There were distinct regions within the spacer, arranged in the order 1-9 for all S. equi and one S. zooepidemicus isolate and 1,2 and 4-9 for the remaining isolates. Region 4 was identical to the tRNA(ala) gene found in the 16S-23S intergenic spacers of other streptococci. Regions 1, 5, 6 and 7 had distinct variations, each conserved in different isolates. However, amongst the intergenic spacers there were different combinations of variant regions, suggesting a role for DNA recombination in their evolution. The intergenic spacer of all isolates of S. equi and one S. zooepidemicus isolate were almost identical. Primers derived from the variant sequences of regions 1 and 5 to 6 were used to group all S. zooepidemicus (n = 17) and S. equi (n = 5) into 1 of 8 types by polymerase chain reaction; three S. zooepidemicus isolates typed the same as S. equi. S. equi and S. zooepidemicus were clearly distinguishable from S. equisimilis and S. dysgalactiae which had shorter regions 5 and 6 and no region 7. Most homology for the group C sequences was found in previously published sequences for the 16S-23S intergenic spacers of S. anginosis, S. constellatus, S. intermedius, S. salivarius and S. agalactiae. A 75-90 nucleotide length shared with S. anginosus and S. intermedius in opposite orientations in the two main variants of region 6 supported the role for DNA recombination in the evolution of the spacer. The 16S-23S intergenic spacers indicate that S. zooepidemicus was the archetypal species for S. equi and that both are genetically more distant from S. equisimilis and S. dysgalactiae. The intergenic spacer can be used to identify specifically the group C streptococci and as an epidemiological marker for S. zooepidemicus.
