TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - One strain of Lactobacillus salivarius, two strains of Lactobacillus reuteri and  Lactobacillus amylovorus, and two strains of Bifidobacterium thermacidophilum with antagonistic effect against Clostridium perfringens were isolated from porcine gastrointestinal tract. Isolates were assayed for their ability to survive in synthetic gastric juice at pH 2.5 and were examined for their ability to grow on agar plate containing porcine bile extract. There was a large variation in the survival of the isolates in gastric juice and growth in the medium containing 0.3% (w/v) bile. L. salivarius G11 and L. amylovorus S6 adhered to the HT-29 epithelial cell line. Cell-free supernatant of L. amylovorus S6 showed higher antagonistic activity as effective as the antibiotics such as neomycin, chlortetracycline, and oxytetracycline against bacterial pathogens including C. perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, Edwardsiella tarda, and Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.
TI  - A general method to generate DNA probes for microorganisms.
AB  - We present a method that permits the rapid generation of DNA probes for eubacteria. In the procedure the variable regions for the 16s rRNA genes are amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and primers based on the conserved regions of these genes. Following sequencing of the variable regions, a choice is possible for a probe specific for that organism. No knowledge of the molecular biology of the microorganism is required prior to the application of this approach. The generality of the method is shown using Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aeromonas salmonicida and Mycobacterium bovis. A. salmonicida was examined in detail and a DNA probe was prepared that distinguishes it from other Aeromonas species.
