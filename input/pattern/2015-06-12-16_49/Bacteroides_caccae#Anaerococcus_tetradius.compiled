TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) and seven other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We assessed the in vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) and seven other antimicrobials against 292 strains of obligately anaerobic bacteria. MICs were determined with the microdilution technique and Wilkins-Chalgren broth according to DIN 58940-83. MIC50/MIC90s (mg/L) for telithromycin were 4/4 for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 2/4 for Fusobacterium spp. and Bilophila wadsworthia, 2/2 for Bacteroides caccae, 1/4 for Bacteroides vulgatus, 0.25/4 for Prevotella spp., > or =0.03/0.5 for Clostridium spp. and 0.125/4 for Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Comparative activity of moxifloxacin in vitro against obligately anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of moxifloxacin and seven other antibiotics (four of them quinolones) against 292 strains of obligately anaerobic bacteria was assessed employing a broth microdilution technique performed in Wilkens-Chalgren broth. MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/l) for moxifloxacin were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis (n = 62) 0.25/2, Bacteroides ovatus (n = 70) 1/4, Bacteroides vulgatus (n = 29) 0.25/1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 17) 2/2, Bacteroides caccae (n = 11) 1/2, Prevotella spp. (n = 11) 0.25/2, Fusobacterium spp. (n = 17) 1/4, Bilophila wadsworthia (n = 29) 0.5/1, and Clostridium spp. (n = 29) 0.125/0.5, respectively. MIC50 values (mg/l) for Bacteroides distasonis (n = 8) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 9) were 0.25. The results indicated that moxifloxacin was almost as active as trovafloxacin, as active as gatifloxacin, and more active than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the anaerobes tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Isolation and identification of intestinal bacteria from Japanese tree frog (Hlya japonica) with the special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The bacteria in the large intestines of eight Japanese tree frogs (Hlya japonica) were enumerated by using an anaerobic culture system. The microorganisms at approximately 3.1 x 10(9) bacteria per g (wet weight) of intestinal contents were present in the intestine of all the frogs tested. No difference of the total bacteria in the frog intestine was observed between two different incubation-temperatures (room temperature and 37 degrees C). Eleven genera and 16 species were isolated from the frog intestine. In most frogs, Bacteroides (B.) caccae and B. vulgatus were detected as the predominant organisms. Escherichia coli was also present in greater numbers in the intestine. Other bacteria isolated at high dilutions were strict anaerobes, including Fusobacterium and Clostridium. Enterococcus faecalis was frequently isolated from the frog intestine. However, four genera of Bifidobacterium, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, and Lactobacillus were not isolated from the frog intestine.
