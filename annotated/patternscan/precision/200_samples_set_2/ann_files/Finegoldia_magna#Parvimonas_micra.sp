TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically relevant gram-positive anaerobic cocci collected over a three-year period in the netherlands.
AB  == the susceptibility of 14 species of 115 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) was  determined for 14 antibiotics. to assure correct identification, strains were genotypically identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and sequencing. susceptibility differences (mic(5)(0) and mic(9)(0)) for penicillin g, clindamycin, tigecycline, levofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, ertapenem, meropenem, metronidazole, and doxycycline were found for the three clinically most relevant gpac species: finegoldia magna, parvimonas micra, and peptoniphilus harei.

TI  == murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., a gram-stain-positive, anaerobic coccus isolated from human wound specimens.
AB  == two strains of previously unknown gram-stain-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria from human wound specimens were characterized using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies and distinguishable biochemical characteristics demonstrated that these two unknown strains, wal 1855c(t) and wal 2038e, are genotypically homogeneous and constitute a novel lineage within clostridium cluster xiii. there was 13-14 % 16s rrna gene  sequence divergence between the novel strains and the most closely related species, parvimonas micra, finegoldia magna and species of helcococcus. based on  the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, a novel genus and species, murdochiella asaccharolytica gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed. strain wal 1855c(t) (=atcc baa-1631(t) =ccug 55976(t)) is the type strain of murdochiella asaccharolytica.

TI  == european surveillance study on antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) are a heterogeneous group of microorganisms  frequently isolated from local and systemic infections. in this study, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical strains isolated in 10 european countries were investigated. after identification of 299 gpac to species level, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid were determined by the agar dilution method according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute. the majority of isolates were identified as finegoldia magna and parvimonas micra (formerly peptostreptococcus micros), isolated from skin and soft tissue infections. all isolates were susceptible to imipenem, metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid. twenty-one isolates (7%) were resistant to penicillin (n=13) and/or to clindamycin (n=12). four isolates were resistant to both agents. the majority of  resistant isolates were identified as f. magna and originated from blood, abscesses and soft tissue infections.

TI  == development of 16s rrna-based probes for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == fluorescent probes targeted at 16s rrna were designed for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus stomatis (pana134), parvimonas micra (pamic1435), finegoldia magna (fmag1250), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (pnasa1254), peptoniphilus ivorii (pnivo731), peptoniphilus harei (pnhar1466), anaerococcus vaginalis (avag1280) and anaerococcus lactolyticus (alac1438), based on the 16s rrna sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. these strains were also used for validation of the probes. application  of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) could be identified with this set of probes. the 16s rrnas of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. most of these isolates were gpac that were not targeted by the probes. no clinical isolates of pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. the fmag1250, pamic1435, pnhar1466, pana134, pnasa1254 and pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. the avag1280 and alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. however, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for  the majority of clinical isolates.
