TI  - Systematic development and validation of sanitization protocols for a chromatographic system designed for biotherapeutics purification.
AB  - Production of protein therapeutics through the application of genetic engineering and biotechnology techniques requires comprehensive attention to good manufacturing practice and good laboratory practice (GMP/GLP) guidelines for product recovery and purification. Validated clean-in-place procedures are part of the master method and require analysis of microbial bioburden to assess the efficacy of cleaning protocols. This article describes the extensive microbial challenge of a chromatography system, the use of membrane filtration methods for high sensitivity microbial contamination measurement, and the effectiveness of sodium hydroxide and ethanol solutions in achieving multilog reduction of microbial contamination.
