TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriologic features of serous otitis media in children.
AB  == aspirates of serous ear fluids from 57 children were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. bacterial growth was noted in 23 patients (40 per cent). aerobic organisms only were recovered in 13 aspirates (57 per cent of the culture-positive aspirates); anaerobic bacteria in four (17 per cent); and mixed  aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in six (26 per cent). a total of 45 bacterial isolates were recovered, accounting for 2.0 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.6 anaerobe). there were a total of 31 aerobic isolates, including hemophilus influenzae (eight isolates), staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae (five of each), and staphylococcus epidermidis and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (four of each). fourteen anaerobes were recovered, including anaerobic gram-positive cocci and bacteroides melaninogenicus (five isolates each) and propionibacterium acnes (three isolates).

TI  == [anaerobic microflora of praepubertal children (author's transl)].
AB  == bacteriologic cultures of the vagina and the cervix of 38 praepubertal children,  aged 3 months to 16 years (average age 9 years) from the outpatient department for infants and juveniles of the 1st department of obstetrics and gynecology of the university of vienna were obtained vaginascopically using anaerobic transportmedia (port a cul) and were examined for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. an average of 5.3 species was also isolated per child (2.9 aerobic and 2.5 anaerobic species). the commonest anaerobes were peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, bact. melaninogenicus, proprionibacterium and veillonella parvula, the prevalent  aerobes, were enterococci, e coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. our results suggest that anaerobic bacteria amount a significant component of the flora of the lower genital-tract of healthy children, as well as of infants with vaginal discharge.
