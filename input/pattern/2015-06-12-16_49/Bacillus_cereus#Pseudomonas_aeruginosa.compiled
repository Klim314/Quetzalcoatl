TI  - Kinetics of bacterial inactivation by 405nm and 520nm light emitting diodes and the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on bacterial susceptibility.
AB  - Photodynamic inactivation studies of microbial pathogens have focused on the use  of an external photosensitizer or a precursor compound to eliminate bacteria. The present study investigated the inactivation kinetics of six bacterial pathogens by a 405nm light emitting diode (LED) without the addition of any external compound. The role of endogenous coproporphyrin on the bacterial susceptibility to LEDs was also examined. Pathogens were illuminated with LEDs at 25, 10 and 4 degrees C for 9h and the inactivation curves were modeled using six different equations. Endogenous coproporphyrin was quantified using an HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector. At a dose of 306J/cm2, the 405nm LED brought about 4.0, 2.1 and 1.9 log reductions in the populations of Staphylococcus aureus at 25, 10 and 4 degrees C, respectively. At all three temperatures, the population of Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes reduced by approximately 2.3 and 1.9 log respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed moderate susceptibility to 405nm LED while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most resistant. Of the six models tested, Hom model proved most suitable. This study demonstrated that 405nm LEDs can be useful in the inactivation of bacterial pathogens with the aid of endogenous coproporphyrin alone.

The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Bioactive compounds isolated from submerged fermentations of the Chilean fungus Stereum rameale.
AB  - Liquid fermentations of the fungus Stereum rameale (N degrees 2511) yielded extracts with antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity reached its peak after 216 h of stirring. Bioassay-guided fractionation methods were employed for the isolation of the bioactive metabolites. Three known compounds were identified: MS-3 (1), vibralactone (2) and vibralactone B (3). The three compounds showed antibacterial activity as a function of their concentration. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of compound 1 against Gram-positive bacteria were as follows: Bacillus cereus (50 mug/mL), Bacillus subtilis (10 mug/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (100 mug/mL). Compounds 2 and 3 were active only against Gram-negative bacteria. The MBC of compound 2 against Escherichia coli was 200 mug/mL. Compound 3 inhibited significantly the growth of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MBC values of 50 and 100 mug/mL, respectively.
TI  - Research into acetone removal from air by biofiltration using a biofilter with straight structure plates.
AB  - The biological air treatment method is based on the biological destruction of organic compounds using certain cultures of microorganisms. This method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. The main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. Tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. This purifier is called biofilter. The biofilter has a special system for packing material humidification which does not require additional energy inputs. In order to extend the packing material's durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. Pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. According to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. When acetone was passed through biofilter's packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%. The species of bacteria capable of removing acetone vapour from the air, i.e. Bacillus (B. cereus, B. subtilis), Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa, P. putida), Stapylococcus (S. aureus) and Rhodococcus sp., was identified in this study during the process of biofiltration. Their amount in the biological packing material changed from 1.6 x 107 to 3.7 x 1011 CFU g-1.
TI  - Design, synthesis, in silico and in vitro studies of substituted 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro pyrimidine phosphorus derivatives.
AB  - Molecular docking studies of the designed two series (4a-l, 6a-l, 9 and 10) of novel substituted phosphorylated 1, 4-dihydropyridine and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives against the drug targets of DHFR from Bacillus cereus, LpxC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, IDH from E. coli and MurB from Staphylococcus aureus were encouraged for their synthesis. These compounds were synthesized from substituted aromatic aldehydes, thiourea/urea and ethyl acetoacetate in presence of polyphosphoric acid (PPA). These were further phosphorylated with diethyl (2-chloroethoxy) methyl phosphonate to get the desired products. In vitro anti-bacterial activity against the specified bacterial strains related to docked protein exhibited good inhibitory activity at different dose concentrations. Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) descriptors of the designed structures have demonstrated their satisfactory drug like properties. The results from Molecular docking, QSAR descriptors and in vitro anti-bacterial activities led to the identification of safer and potential antibacterial agents of the title compounds screened. Compounds 4a, 4d, 4i, 6a, 6d, 9 and 10 were found to be potent antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of native California medicinal plant extracts isolated from Rhamnus californica and Umbellularia californica.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global public health. Medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. Rhamnus californica (Rhamnaceae) and Umbellularia californica (Lauraceae) are two indigenous California plant species historically used by Native Americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. This study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. Chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. RESULTS: All extracts inhibited the growth of MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria with MICs of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. Gram-negative organisms were unaffected by these extracts. U. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had the lowest MIC values. Chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. Our study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of R. and U. californica and illustrates their promising anti-MRSA potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of California. Further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against MRSA is warranted.
TI  - A novel antimicrobial flavonoid from the stem bark of Commiphora pedunculata (Kotschy & Peyr.) Engl.
AB  - A new flavonoid, 2-(3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-8,8-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-8H-pyra no[3,2]chromen-4-one, together with previously reported epicatechin was isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of the methanol extract of the stem bark of Commiphora pedunculata. The structures of these compounds were elucidated based on extensive analysis of their spectral data, including 1 and 2D NMR. The compounds were active against 9 out of 12 tested microorganisms including a resistant strain; vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The zones of inhibition ranged between 22 and 34 mm against the microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration was as low as 6.25 mug/mL against Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus and S. aureus while the minimum bactericidal concentration was as low as 50 mug/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, VRE and C.albicans. This is the first report of the isolation of the compound.
TI  - Ieodoglucomide C and Ieodoglycolipid, New Glycolipids from a Marine-Derived Bacterium Bacillus licheniformis 09IDYM23.
AB  - Chemical examination of the ethyl acetate extract from the fermentation broth of  the marine-derived bacterium Bacillus licheniformis resulted in the isolation of two new glycolipids, ieodoglucomide C (1) and ieodoglycolipid (2). The structural characterization of 1 and 2 was achieved by extensive spectroscopic evidence, including 2D NMR experiments. A combination of chemical derivatization techniques followed by NMR studies, LC-MS data analysis and a literature review was deployed for the establishment of the stereo-configurations of 1 and 2. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited good antibiotic properties against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MICs ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 muM. Furthermore, the antifungal activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated against plant pathogenic fungi Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea and Colletotrichum acutatum as well as the human pathogen Candida albicans. Compounds 1 and 2 inhibited the mycelial growth of these pathogens with MIC values of 0.03-0.05 muM, revealing that these compounds are good candidates for the development of new fungicides.
TI  - Secondary metabolites of Seseli rigidum: Chemical composition plus antioxidant, antimicrobial and cholinesterase inhibition activity.
AB  - Extracts of different polarity obtained from various plant parts (root, leaf, flower and fruit) of Seseli rigidum were studied by different antioxidant assays: DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity, by total reducing power method as well as via total content of flavonoids and polyphenols. Essential oils of all plant parts showed weak antioxidant characteristics. The inhibitory concentration range of the tested extracts, against bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger was 0.01-1.50mg/mL and of a microbicidal 0.02-3.00mg/mL. In the interaction with cholinesterase, all essential oils proved effective as inhibitors. The highest percentage of inhibition versus human and horse cholinesterase was shown by root essential oil (38.20% and 48.30%, respectively) among oils, and root hexane extract (40.56% and 50.65% respectively). Essential oils and volatile components of all plant parts were identified by GC, GC-MS and headspace/GC-MS. Statistical analysis of the ensemble of results showed that the root essential oil composition differed significantly from essential oils of other parts of the plant. Taking into account all of the studied activities, the root hexane extract showed the best overall properties. By means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, the 30 most abundant constituents were identified in extracts of different polarity. The presence of identified constituents was linked to observed specific biological activities, thus designating compounds potentially responsible for each exhibited activity.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, KL-1Y, from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1.
AB  - Three bacteriocins from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin peptides KL-1X, -1Y and -1Z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 Da, respectively. All three peptides were stable at pH 2-12 and 25 degrees C and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min. However, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. KL-1Y showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739. KL-1X and -1Z inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. KL-1X, KL-1Y and KL-1Z exhibited synergistic activity. The successful amino acid sequencing of KL-1Y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin KL-1Y". Plantaricin KL-1Y exhibited bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus JCM 2152(T). Compared to nisin, KL-1Y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 AU/mL against the growth of Bacillus coagulans JCM 2257(T), B. cereus JCM 2152(T), Listeria innocua ATCC 33090(T), Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 118, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only B. coagulans JCM 2257(T) and B. cereus JCM 2152(T). Therefore, the novel plantaricin KL-1Y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
TI  - Grafted alpha-hydroxyphosphonic acids onto polymeric supports: preparation, characterization, and antimicrobial effect.
AB  - The paper deals with the preparation and characterization of compounds with antimicrobial activity: alpha-hydroxyphosphonic acids grafted onto styrene-12%-(15%)-divinylbenzene copolymer. These products proved to have antimicrobial effect against two species of gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two species of gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and a species of yeast (Candida albicans). Tests showed the reduction of bacterial load at different time intervals during the 18 h of contact.
TI  - Distinguishing the dominant species of pathogen in maxillary sinusitis by sequencing DNA dataset analysis.
AB  - This study determined the microbial composition in maxillary sinusitis and determined the predominant fungal and bacterial species. Samples were obtained from 11 patients with fungal sinusitis and 2 healthy patients. The 13 samples were sequenced using an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000, and mapping to the human, bacterial, and the fungal genomes were based on several steps. Bioinformatics and statistical analyses were then performed for bacterial and fungal expressions in the samples. All samples were cultures for fungal growth. The sequencing data revealed that Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus oryzae were the dominant fungal strains in the rhinosinusitis samples, and Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis were the dominant bacterial strains. Indeed, the fungi and bacteria were associated with the development of fungal rhinosinusitis. Furthermore, B. cereus and B. thuringiensis may cooperate with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to inhibit the growth of fungal mycelia. Knowledge of the microbial composition can provide a diagnostic reference for patients with maxillary sinusitis.
TI  - [Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra Oaxaca, Mexico].
AB  - Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra  Oaxaca, Mexico. Bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. They have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. To contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. For this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from February to October 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. Each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees C. Bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and biochemical tests. We obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. We found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum Proteobacteria and the family Enterobacteriaceae. Statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. It was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with Bacillus cereus, B. sp. X. sp., as well as, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. Bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. These bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. By understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.
TI  - Biogenic silver and gold nanoparticles synthesized using red ginseng root extract, and their applications.
AB  - In the present study, we report a green methodology for the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles, using the root extract of the herbal medicinal plant Korean red ginseng. The silver and gold nanoparticles were synthesized within 1 h and 10 min respectively. The nanoparticles generated were not aggregated, and remained stable for a long time, which suggests the nature of nanoparticles. The phytochemicals and ginsenosides present in the root extract assist in reducing and stabilizing the synthesized nanoparticles. The red ginseng root extract-generated silver nanoparticles exhibit antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. In addition, the silver nanoparticles exhibit biofilm degrading activity against S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, the present study opens up a new possibility of synthesizing silver and gold nanoparticles in a green and rapid manner using Korean red ginseng root extract, and explores their biomedical applications.
TI  - Improved in vitro assay for determining the mucin adherence of bacteria sensitive to Triton X-100 treatment.
AB  - Mucin-associated microbiota are in relatively close contact with the intestinal epithelium and may thus have a more pronounced effect on host health. We have previously developed a simple mucin agar assay to simulate initial mucus colonization by intestinal microbial communities. Adherence of microbiota was estimated using flow cytometry after detachment with Triton X-100. In this study, the effect of this detergent on the cultivability of both virulent and commensal strains was investigated. Mucin attachment of selected strains was evaluated using the mucin adhesion assay. Bacteria were dislodged from the mucin surface by incubation with Triton or from the whole mucin agar layer using a stomacher. Mechanical extraction resulted in 1.24 +/- 0.42, 2.69 +/- 0.44, and 1.56 +/- 0.85 log CFU/mL higher plate counts of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli strains, respectively, than the chemical method. The sensitivity of bacteria to Triton varied among microbial species and strains. Among others, Triton inhibited the growth of Salmonella enterica LMG 10396 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa LMG 8029 on laboratory media, although these bacteria maintained their viability during this treatment. Only Gram-positive strains, Enterococcus hirae LMG 6399 and L. rhamnosus GG, were not affected by this detergent. Therefore, the mechanical method is recommended for the extraction of mucin-adhered bacteria that are sensitive to Triton, especially when followed by traditional cultivation techniques. However, this approach can also be recommended for strains that are not affected by this detergent, because it resulted in higher recovery of adhered L. rhamnosus GG compared to the chemical extraction.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activities of Three Medicinal Plants and Investigation of Flavonoids of Tripleurospermum disciforme.
AB  - Rosa damascena, Tripleurospermum disciforme and Securigera securidaca were used as disinfectant agents and for treatment of some disease in folk medicine of Iran. The antimicrobial effects of different fractions of seeds extract of S. securidaca, petals extract of R. damascena and aerial parts extract of T. disciforme were examined against some gram positive, gram negative and fungi by cup plate diffusion method. The petroleum ether and chloroform fractions of S. securidaca showed antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while its methanol fraction had no antibacterial effects. R. damascena petals extract demonstrated antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. T. disciforme aerial parts extract exhibited antimicrobial effects only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. None of the fractions had any antifungal activities. Therefore, present study confirmed utility of these plants as disinfectant agents. Six flavonoids were isolated from T. disciforme: Luteolin, Quercetin-7-O-glucoside, Kaempferol, Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, Apigenin and Apigenin-7-O-glucoside. The flavonoids and the antimicrobial activity of T. disciforme are reported for the first time.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of Pulicaria vulgaris essential oil  from Iran.
AB  - The present study investigated the chemical composition of the essential oil (EO) from aerial parts (flowering stage) of Pulicaria vulgaris Gaertn. by GC-MS. Also, the antimicrobial activity of the EO against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans) was tested. In total, 23 compounds were recognized, accounting for 98.08% of the EO. The main compounds in the EO were thymol (50.22%), p-menth-6-en-2-one (carvotanacetone, 20.2%), thymol isobutyrate (16.88%), menthan-2-one (4.31%), 1-methyl-1,2-propanedione (4.13%), 2,5-dimethoxy-p-cymene (4.01%), myrtenol (1.22%), linalool (1.1%), and beta-myrcene (1.9%). Results of antibacterial test of P. vulgaris essential oil showed that all assayed concentrations significantly inhibited the growth of B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at P < 0.05. MIC for B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa was 17.5, 25.2, 19.4 and 33.2 mug/mL respectively; antifungal screening of the essential oil of P. vulgaris showed that the oil significantly inhibited the growth of A. niger and C. albicans (MIC = 15.5 and 9.9 mug/mL, respectively). Results of cytotoxicity assay showed that the essential oil exhibited a significant cytotoxic activity against both cell lines. In case of MCF-7 and Hep-G2 cell lines, IC50 of the essential oil were 5.36 and 7.16 mug/ml, respectively. The potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the EO may be attributed to its high contents of thymol, carvotanacetone and thymol isobutyrate. Antimicrobial and antitumor chemotherapies are showing diminishing effectiveness because of emergence of drug-resistance. Hence, using efficient natural chemotherapeutic agents such as Pulicaria vulgaris essential oil with fewer side effects is an encouraging approach to fight cancer and infectious diseases in medicine, agriculture, food science and related fields.
TI  - Evaluating the efficiency of humic acid to remove micro-organisms from denture base material.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of humic acid substances on removing micro-organisms from denture base materials. BACKGROUND: Old denture wearer needs effective, easy-use and safe denture-cleaning material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Square-shaped, heat-polymerised acrylic resin specimens (n = 550) were prepared and divided into five groups (n = 110 for each) corresponding to the microbial contamination (Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Contaminated specimens were randomly assigned to the application of five different denture-cleaning agents as follows (n = 20 for each): Kloroben, Corsodyl, Steradent, Corega, experimental solution with humic acid. Ten specimens were assessed as an experimental control carried out simultaneously for the treatment groups for each micro-organism. It was divided into two groups: negative control and positive control (n = 5 for each). All acrylic specimens were incubated 37 degrees C for 24 h (for bacterial strains) and 37 degrees C for 48 h (for yeast strains). After incubation period, all brain-heart infusion broths (BHI) which contain disinfectant acrylic specimens were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar (for bacteria) and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for yeast using loop. The numbers of colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/ml) were calculated. The results were analysed by Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Corsodyl and Kloroben completely eliminated the adherence of all investigated micro-organisms (100%) and showed the highest removal activity compared with other cleaning agents (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between Corsodyl and Kloroben (p >/= 0.05), and there was no statistically significant difference between Corega, Steradent and experimental solution (p >/= 0.05). CONCLUSION: Humic acid could be used as an alternative 'natural' solution for denture-cleaning agent.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant heterotrophic plate count bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria in aquifers of the Mooi River, North West province, South Africa.
AB  - Groundwater in the Mooi River catchment is prone to mining, agricultural, municipal and septic tank pollution. In this study physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were determined using appropriate methods. Bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing (heterotrophic plate count (HPC) bacteria and amoeba-resistant bacteria (ARB)) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Escherichia coli). Antibiotic resistance tests were also performed. Physico-chemical parameters were generally within target water quality ranges for drinking water. HPC bacteria ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. E. coli were enumerated from Trimpark, School and Cemetery. The Blaauwbank borehole was negative for faecal streptococci. Pseudomonas spp. were most abundant in the bulk water. Opportunistic pathogens isolated included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Flavobacterium, Bacillus cereus and Mycobacterium spp. Varying patterns of antibiotic resistance were observed. Most HPC bacterial isolates were resistant to cephalothin and/or amoxicillin and a few were resistant to erythromycin and streptomycin. Pseudomonas spp. was also the most abundant ARB. Other ARBs included Alcaligenes faecalis, Ochrobactrum sp. and Achromobacter sp. ARBs were resistant to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalothin, and/or amoxicillin compared to HPCs. The presence of E. coli and ARB in these groundwater sources indicates potential human health risks. These risks should be further investigated and quantified, and groundwater should be treated before use.
TI  - The analysis of distribution of multidrug resistant Pseudomonas and Bacillus species from burn patients and burn ward environment.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria act as a risk factor for mortality in burns patients. So keeping in view the crucial importance of reliable therapeutic decisions of multidrug resistance bacteria and role of hospital environment in bacteria colonization, our study is based on the evaluation of distribution of Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. in burn patients and burn ward environment. METHODS: The present prospective analysis was conducted on the patients undergoing treatment in the Burn ward of Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, during the period of January 2012 to March 2013. The multidrug resistant bacteria were characterized by following the CLSI guidelines. Molecular identification isolates were done by amplifying and sequencing 16S rDNA. RESULTS: In our study out of 510 samples of 280 burn patients, 263 samples were observed sterile and bacterial isolates were obtained from 247 samples. In burn patients out of 247 samples 43 MDR strains, and in burn ward out of 60 samples 4 MDR strain were observed. After 16S rDNA amplification of MDR isolates the prevalent bacterium was belonged to the genus Bacillus (8 species; 26 isolates) followed by genus Pseudomonas (5 species; 17 isolates). The burn ward environment isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Bacillus cereus and Acinetobacter baumanii. CONCLUSION: The major finding of our study is the predominance of B. cereus followed by P. aeruginosa in burn patients of Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana. While considering the role of hospital environment, no direct role of environmental isolates was observed in transfer of bacterial infection.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of Calotropis gigantea L.
AB  - The present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of Calotropis gigantea L. toward biomedical applications. Initially, synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (SPR) at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of silver as a major constituent element. X-ray diffractograms displays that the synthesized AgNPs were biphasic crystalline nature. Electron microscopic studies such as Field emission scanning electron microscopic (Fe-SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that synthesized AgNPs are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. Further, crude latex aqueous extract and synthesized AgNPs were evaluated against different bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Enterococci sp, Shigella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized AgNPs exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized AgNPs against tested HeLa cells. The output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized AgNPs using latex of C. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.
TI  - Phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus; characterization of catalytic activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study characteristics of phospholipases C (PLCs), their importance  for producing microorganisms as well as the potential of their use for industrial purposes. METHOD: PLC from Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) D101 was selected as an example of Gram-positive PLCs and PLC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) D183 of Gram-negative ones. Enzymes were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by membrane dialysis. Partially purified preparations were used to study effect of different factors on activities as well as in substrate specificity tests which were conducted using a turbidimetric assay method. RESULTS: Maximum activity was at pH 7 and 8 and 40 degrees C for P. aeruginosa PLC, and pH 8-10 and 37 degrees C for B. cereus PLC. Both PLCs were inhibited by Pi at 5 mM or higher, whereas, PLC from B. cereus only was inhibited by EDTA. Activity of P. aeruginosa PLC was not affected by removing Zn(2+) ions from reaction mixture or their replacement with Ca(2+), Ba(2+), Mg(2+) or Mn(2+) ions. Vis-a-vis, activity of B. cereus PLC was found to be metal ion dependent. PLCs from both isolates were relatively thermostable and showed maximum affinity toward phosphatidylcholine. Sphingomyelin and phosphatidylethanolamine were not good substrates and phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin could be considered non-substrates. CONCLUSION: Human body physiological conditions could favor activity of P. aeruginosa and B. cereus PLCs. These enzymes may participate in phosphate scavenging and virulence of producing isolates but not in autolysis. PLCs from both isolates are potential candidates for industrial use.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of Pleurostylia capensis Turcz (Loes) (celastraceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pleurostylia capensis is a large tree that can reach the maximum height of 20 m long, and it have been traditionally used as cosmetic, for steam bath, ritual body wash, and as a purgative to treat symptoms of witchcraft. Using ethanol, chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA), and water extracts, leaves, bark and roots of Pleurostylia capensis were investigated scientifically for their effectiveness in antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities using standard methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis), Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium), and Candida albicans. The antioxidant activity was investigated using 2, 2-diphenlyl-1-picrylhadrazyl (DPPH), free radical scavenging assay. The anti-inflammatory activity of P. capensis extracts was evaluated against both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX 1 and 2). RESULTS: The ethyl acetate extracts of P. capensis showed a strong antimicrobial activity against B. cereus, K. pneumonia, S. pyogenes, and M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.39 and 0.78 mg/ml. While the ethanol bark extract was most active against M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.78 mg/ml; the least potent activity was observed with dichloromethane, chloroform and water extracts, with an MIC value ranging from 1.56 mg/ml to 50.0 mg/ml. The plant extracts proved to be good antioxidant agent, whereas extracts of ethanol were the most active, with IC50 ranging from 1.00 to 1.74 microg/ml, which is lower, and in close range to Vitamin C (1.40 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Its moderation to potent inhibitory activity was observed in all extracts. Ethanol and dichloromethane extracts were among the most potent when compared to water and petroleum ether extracts. The water extracts showed to be nontoxic on the Hek cell line with an IC50 value of 204.0, and 207.3 microg/ml (roots and bark) respectively. The dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, chloroform and ethanol extracts showed to be toxic on the Hek cell, with IC50 range from 5.94 to 42.91microg/ml. The results obtained indicate the effectiveness of these plants.
TI  - Pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Linum usitatissimum, commonly known as Flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. This study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude aqueous-methanolic extract of Flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. Mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing Tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees C and aerated with carbogen. Antibacterial efficacy of the Flaxseed extract was tested against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. RESULTS: Flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. Intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. When tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, Flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high K(+) (80mM)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of Ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. Flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), Escherichia coli K1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), Bacillus cereus (92.64%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (76.83%) and Salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). The concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except Escherichia coli K1, whereas for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, it was bacteriostatic at this concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of Ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. Flaxseed extract proved effective against both enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
TI  - In vitro antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-proliferative activities of purple potato extracts (Solanum tuberosum cv Vitelotte noire) following simulated gastro-intestinal digestion.
AB  - Analyses of antioxidant and in vitro antimicrobial and anti-proliferative activities of anthocyanin-rich extracts from purple potatoes, Solanum tuberosum L. cv Vitelotte noire (Solanaceae), were performed by simulating both a domestic cooking process and human digestion. Extracts of crude and cooked purple potato did not exhibit antimicrobial activity against the tester strains: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The behaviour changed after the simulated gastrointestinal transit, when an inhibition halo was observed against all tester strains used, ranging from 0.53 cm against B. cereus to 0.82 cm against E. coli. In addition antioxidant activity exhibited, before and after the simulated gastrointestinal digestion (5.96 mg/mL +/- 0.92; 28 mg/mL +/- 0 .13, respectively) and the persistence of anti-proliferative activity against the colon cancer cells Caco-2, SW48 and MCF7, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, after the simulated digestion, (EC50 = 0.21; 1.13 mug/mL), suggest that vitelotte consumption might bring tangible benefits for human health.
TI  - Infection of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: detection with sonication, swab cultures, and blood cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is increasing. The purpose of this study was to compare three methods (sonication, swab cultures, and blood cultures) to detect bacteria in infections of CIEDs. METHODS: Patients with pocket infection of CIEDs and/or CIED-associated infective endocarditis were prospectively included. Generators and leads were sonicated together. Swab cultures of the generator pocket and blood cultures were performed. RESULTS: Between January 2009 and September 2012, 18 patients with a CIED infection were recorded, including two definite and four possible CIED-IEs. In 17 patients, blood cultures were performed and the device was analyzed by sonication. A swab culture from the device pocket was performed in 16 cases. Ten (59%) patients received antibiotic therapy before the device was removed. In 15 of 16 cases (94%), bacteria were detected by sonication, while bacteria were detected in only nine (56%) and seven (41%) cases by swab-and blood cultures, respectively. In four cases (24%), sonication was the only method that detected bacteria. The following bacteria were detected by sonication: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 6), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; n = 3), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 2), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (n = 1), MSSA/Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1),Bacillus cereus (n = 1), MSSA/P. acnes (n = 1), andP. acnes/CNS (n = 1). All positive swab cultures and all positive blood cultures but one grew the same bacteria as sonication fluid cultures. CONCLUSION: Sonication can be more sensitive than swab cultures or blood cultures in detecting bacteria in infections of CIEDs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of Mentha longifolia L. and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. plants against important human pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from Mentha longifolia L. (M. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. (Z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. METHODS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia), Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of M. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. RESULTS: The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/mL) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/mL) were observed by the aqueous extracts of M. longifolia. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it seems that Z. multiflora and M. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
TI  - Development of biopolymer nanocomposite for silver nanoparticles and Ciprofloxacin controlled release.
AB  - Screening of biopolymeric gel beads containing Silver NanoParticles (Ag-NPs) stabilized in Guar Gum Alkyl Amine (GGAA) and Ciprofloxacin (Cip) was carried out in order to obtain a novel nanocomposite with controlled release profile of both antimicrobians. The selected matrix composed of Alginate/High Methoxyl Pectin (HMP)/GGAA (4:4:1) was able to co-incorporate Ag-NPs and Cip with encapsulation efficiency higher than 70%. SEM images revealed good cohesivity and compatibility between the biopolymers and the cargos. Beads provided protection against Ag-NPs degradation at acidic pHs and HMP would played a key role providing hydrophobic regions. While Cip release profile showed a pH independent diffusional process, Ag-NPs release was restricted to matrix erodability. Calcium quelating agents and/or alginate degrading enzymes could modulate the release profile. The bactericidal activity of beads was tested in liquid medium, showing cooperative effects between the antimicrobials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. TEM images confirmed interaction of Ag-NPs with bacterial surfaces followed by membrane damage. Results suggested the nanocomposite matrix as a promising system for oral treatment of intestinal infectious diseases caused by multidrug resistant and unknown microorganisms, since both Cip and Ag-NPs would be able to reach intestine in the active form.
TI  - Two rhizobacterial strains, individually and in interactions with Rhizobium sp.,  enhance fusarial wilt control, growth, and yield in pigeon pea.
AB  - A Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, RRLJ 04, and a Bacillus cereus strain, BS 03, were tested both individually and in combination with a Rhizobium strain, RH 2, for their ability to enhance plant growth and nodulation in pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.) under gnotobiotic, greenhouse and field conditions. Both of the rhizobacterial strains exhibited a positive effect on growth in terms of shoot height, root length, fresh and dry weight, nodulation and yield over the non-treated control. Co-inoculation of seeds with these strains and Rhizobium RH 2 also reduced the number of wilted plants, when grown in soil infested with Fusarium udum. Gnotobiotic studies confirmed that the suppression of wilt disease was due to the presence of the respective PGPR strains. Seed bacterization with drug-marked mutants of RRLJ 04 and BS 03 confirmed their ability to colonize and multiply along the roots. The results suggest that co-inoculation of these strains with Rhizobium strain RH 2 can be further exploited for enhanced growth, nodulation and yield in addition to control of fusarial wilt in pigeon pea.
TI  - Analgesic, antibacterial and central nervous system depressant activities of Albizia procera leaves.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain analgesic, antibacterial and central nervous system (CNS) depressant activities of ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and carbon tetrachloride fractions of methanol extract of Albizia procera (A. procera) leaves. METHODS: Leaves extracts of A. procera were tested for analgesic activity by acetic acid induced and formalin test method in mice. The in vitro antibacterial activity was performed by agar well diffusion method. CNS depressant activity was evaluated by hole cross and open field tests. RESULTS: All the extracts at 200 mg/kg exhibited significant (P<0.01) analgesic activity in acetic acid induced and formalin tests method in mice. Analgesic activity of the ethyl acetate fraction was almost same like as standard drug indomethacin in acetic acid induced method. The CNS depressant activity of the extracts at 500 mg/kg was comparable to the positive control diazepam as determined by hole cross and open field test method. The extracts exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against all the tested microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Esherichia coli, Shigella soneii, Shigella boydii) at concentration of 0.8 mg/disc. The measured diameter of zone of inhibition for the extracts was within the range of 7 to 12 mm which was less than the standard kanamycin (16-24 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that all the extracts possess potential analgesic and CNS depressants activity. This study also showed that different fractions of methanol extract could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - The Antibacterial Activity of Cassia fistula Organic Extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cassia fistula, is a flowering plant and a member of Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound of 4 - 8 pairs of opposite leaflets. There are many Cassia species around the world which are used in herbal medicine. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula native to Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial inhibitory effect of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula was tested on 3 Gram positive: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and 5 Gram negative: Salmonella Typhi, Kelebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis bacterial species using disc diffusion method at various concentrations. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were measured by the tube dilution assay. RESULTS: The extract of C. fistula was effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The most susceptible microorganisms to ethanolic and methanolic extracts were E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also B. cereus and S. aureus showed the least sensitivity to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of ethanolic extracts against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the obtained results and regarding to the daily increase of the resistant microbial strains to the commercial antibiotics, it can be concluded that these extracts can be proper candidates of antibacterial substance against pathogenic bacterial species especially S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity of Holothuria leucospilota Isolated From Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of antimicrobial resistance toward a number of conventional antibiotics has triggered the search for antimicrobial agents from a variety of sources including the marine environment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of Holothuria leucospilota from Qeshm and Kharg Islands against some selected bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, sea cucumbers from two coastal cities of Persian Gulf were collected in March and May 2011 and identified by the scale method according to the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations. Antibacterial activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of the body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid, methanol, chloroform, and n-hexane extracts of the body wall were evaluated by the spot test. In addition, their antifungal activity was assessed by the broth dilution method. RESULTS: The displayed effect was microbiostatic at concentrations of 1000 and 2000 microg/mL rather than microbicidal. The highest activity of hydroalcoholic extracts was exhibited by body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. brasilensis. However, none of the methanol, chloroform and n-haxane extracts showed appreciable effects against Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. Moreover, cuvierian organs did not possess any antifungal potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that water-methanol extracts from the body wall of H. leucospilota possess antibacterial and antifungal activity. However, additional and in-depth studies are required to isolate and identify the active component(s).
TI  - Antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of Garcinia cowa.
AB  - A phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  Garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones A (1) and B (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688, Bacillus subtilis TISTR 008, Micrococcus luteus TISTR 884, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, Escherichia coli TISTR 780, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR 781, Salmonella typhimurium TISTR 292 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. alpha-Mangostin showed potent activity (MIC 0.25-1 mug/mL) against three Gram-positive strains and garcicowanone A and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against B. cereus with the same MIC values of 0.25 mug/mL.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria via photosensitization of vitamin K3 by UV-A light.
AB  - This study investigated inactivation of bacteria with ultraviolet light A irradiation in combination with vitamin K3 as a photosensitizer. Six bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli suspended in vitamin K3 aqueous solution were exposed to ultraviolet light A. Five of six bacteria, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were reduced by eight logs with 1600 muM of vitamin K3 and 5.8 J cm(-2) UV-A irradiation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by four logs under these conditions. Reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion radical were generated in vitamin K3 aqueous solution under UV-A irradiation. These results suggest that vitamin K3 and UV-A irradiation may be effective for bacterial inactivation in environmental and medical applications.
TI  - Unsaturated fatty acid, cis-2-decenoic acid, in combination with disinfectants or antibiotics removes pre-established biofilms formed by food-related bacteria.
AB  - Biofilm formation by food-related bacteria and food-related pathogenesis are significant problems in the food industry. Even though much disinfection and mechanical procedure exist for removal of biofilms, they may fail to eliminate pre-established biofilms. cis-2 decenoic acid (CDA), an unsaturated fatty acid messenger produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is reportedly capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms by multiple types of microorganisms. However, whether CDA has potential to boost the actions of certain antimicrobials is unknown. Here, the activity of CDA as an inducer of pre-established biofilms dispersal, formed by four main food pathogens; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enterica and E. coli, was measured using both semi-batch and continuous cultures bioassays. To assess the ability of CDA combined biocides treatments to remove pre-established biofilms formed on stainless steel discs, CFU counts were performed for both treated and untreated cultures. Eradication of the biofilms by CDA combined antibiotics was evaluated using crystal violet staining. The effect of CDA combined treatments (antibiotics and disinfectants) on biofilm surface area and bacteria viability was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, digital image analysis and LIVE/DEAD staining. MICs were also determined to assess the probable inhibitory effects of CDA combined treatments on the growth of tested microorganisms' planktonic cells. Treatment of pre-established biofilms with only 310 nM CDA resulted in at least two-fold increase in the number of planktonic cells in all cultures. While antibiotics or disinfectants alone exerted a trivial effect on CFU counts and percentage of surface area covered by the biofilms, combinational treatments with both 310 nM CDA and antibiotics or disinfectants led to approximate 80% reduction in biofilm biomass. These data suggests that combined treatments with CDA would pave the way toward developing new strategies to control biofilms with widespread applications in industry as well as medicine.
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  - The suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. A variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteriditis, Candida tropicalis or Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and CO2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (Don Whitely R.A.B.I.T.) system. The majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced a detectable growth signal. The linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (R(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. Specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. This initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Commercial herbal slimming products: concern for the presence of heavy metals and bacteria.
AB  - The increment of rate in obesity, the phenomenon of fat phobia as well as the increased use of herbal medicine had lead to the emergence of herbal slimming products. However, numerous bacteria and heavy metal contaminations are often found in herbal products due to irregular handling practices. Ten different brands of products (labeled as A-J) were investigated. Seven heavy metals content such as As, Cd, Pb, Co, Cr, Cu and Zn were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and bacterial presence was determined by counting the total aerobic count. The identification of isolates was carried out by macroscopic and microscopic observation, biochemical tests and confirmation using commercial kits of Microgen GN-ID A+B and API 20 E. The heavy metal contents in the samples were below the limit of the standard limitation by WHO and Health Canada. However, sample A contained the highest total daily intake of heavy metals. Total aerobic count was highest in sample H followed by G, A, B, C, F, D, E, I and J in which G and H exceeded the standard total aerobic count (10(5) CFU g(-1)) as given by WHO. A total of nine isolates of Bacillus spp. and ten gram-negative bacteria were isolated in which Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found in samples C and F, respectively. Considering the fact that the herbal sliming products contained low concentration of heavy metals and bacteria count, it should be consumed with caution.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and carbonic anhydrase enzyme inhibitor effects of salicilaldehyde-N-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone and its Palladium(II), Cobalt(II) complexes.
AB  - We report the synthesis of the ligand, salicilaldehyde-N-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (salptsmh) derived from p-toluenesulfonicacid-1-methylhydrazide (ptsmh) and its Pd(II) and Co(II) metal complexes were synthesized for the first time. The structure of the ligand and their complexes were investigated using elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance and spectral (IR, NMR and LC-MS) measurements. Salptsmh has also been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. (1)H and (13)C shielding tensors for crystal structure were calculated with GIAO/DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) methods in CDCl3. The complexes were found to have general composition [ML2]. The results of elemental analysis showed 1:2 (metal/ligand) stoichiometry for all the complex. Magnetic and spectral data indicate a square planar geometry for Pd(II) complex and a distorted tetrahedral geometry for Co(II) complexes. The ligand and its metal chelates have been screened for their antimicrobial activities using the disk diffusion method against the selected Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Gram negative bacteria: Eschericha coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia. The inhibition activities of these compounds on carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) and carbonic anhydrase I (CA I) have been investigated by comparing IC50 and Ki values and it has been found that Pd(II) complex have more enzyme inhibition efficiency than salptsmh and Co(II) complex.
TI  - Electrochemical detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in human fluid samples via pyocyanin.
AB  - The ability to quickly detect the presence of pathogenic bacteria in patient samples is of the outmost importance to expedient patient care. Here we report the direct, selective, and sensitive detection of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, spiked in human whole blood with sodium heparin, urine, sputum, and bronchial lavage samples using unmodified, disposable carbon electrode sensors that detect the presence of pyocyanin, a virulence factor that is unique to this species. Square wave voltammetry scans of biological fluids from healthy individuals spiked with P. aeruginosa showed a clear pyocyanin response within one day of culturing at 37 degrees C. Scans of supernatants taken from cultures of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Bacillus cereus taken over a span of three days in the potential range from -0.5 to 0 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference showed no electrochemically detectable molecules with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The results indicate the potential to sensitively and selectively determine the presence of P. aeruginosa in human samples via the electrochemical detection of pyocyanin in less than 5 min, without any sample preparation or separation steps.
TI  - Studies on Antimicrobial and Immunomodulatory Effects of Hot Aqueous Extract of Acacia nilotica L. Leaves against Common Veterinary Pathogens.
AB  - Acacia nilotica is a plant species that is almost ubiquitously found in different parts of the world. Various preparations of it have been advocated in folk medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, smallpox, dysentery, cough, ophthalmia, toothache, skin cancer as astringent, antispasmodic, and aphrodisiac since immemorial times. The present study investigates the antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and immunomodulatory potential of hot aqueous extract (HAE) of Acacia nilotica leaves. On dry matter basis, the filtered HAE had a good extraction ratio (33.46%) and was found to have carbohydrates, glycosides, phytosterols, phenolic compounds, saponins, and flavonoids as major constituents. HAE produced dose dependent zone of inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus uberis and fungal pathogens Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigates; however, no antiviral activity was recorded against IBR virus. HAE of A. nilotica revealed both proliferative and inhibitory effects on the rat splenocytes and IL-10 release depending on the dose. Detailed studies involving wide spectrum of bacterial, fungal, and viral species are required to prove or know the exact status of each constituents of the plant extract.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial features of vasopressors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs administered as intravenous infusion may be contaminated during several stages of production or preparation. However studies focusing on antibacterial effects of vasopressor drugs are very rare. This study investigates the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the clinically used forms of vasopressors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro antimicrobial activities of vasopressor drugs of different concentrations were investigated by using the micro dilution technique. Microorganisms used in the test were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ATCC 911, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 43251, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus 702 Roma, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC607, Candida albicans ATCC 60193, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSKK 251. Antibacterial assays were performed in Mueller-Hinton broth at pH 7.3 and antifungal assays were performed in buffered Yeast Nitrogen Base at pH 7.0. RESULTS: Two different dopamine preparations showed antimicrobial activity. No other study drug showed any antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, dopamine's antibacterial effects may be advantageous for inhibiting the spread of bacterial contamination during the preparation of the infusion solutions. However, it is important that strict guidelines regarding the need for sterile equipment and deliverables be adhered to during all procedures performed in the intensive care units.
TI  - Role of structural changes induced in biological membranes by hydrolysable tannins from sumac leaves (Rhus typhina L.) in their antihemolytic and antibacterial effects.
AB  - In this study, we found that the sumac tannins (Rhus typhina L.) exert to a various extent antihemolytic effects and antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa depending on structural specificity of bacteria and different mechanisms of their toxic action. The sumac tannins exert the most expressed activity against B. cereus. The antihemolytic effect of the sumac tannins seems to be connected to a greater extent with their modifying action on the erythrocyte membrane structure. It was found that the sumac tannins are incorporated into the erythrocyte membrane, causing transformation of discocytes into echinocytes and enhancing the rigidity of the hydrophilic region of the lipid bilayer. We suggest that the embedding of sumac tannins into the membrane of erythrocytes alters their physical properties and, as a consequence, can limit their interaction with bacterial toxins.
TI  - Computational studies of the first order kinetic reactions for mononuclear copper(II) complexes having a hard-soft NS donor ligand.
AB  - The chelation behaviour of 4-((E)-2-(1-(thiophen-2-yl)ethylidene)hydrazinyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrrole- 3-carbonitrile (HL) towards Cu(II) ions has been investigated. These Cu(II) complexes are characterized by elemental analyses, molar-solid conductance, ESR, FTIR and electronic spectral studies. Also, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters (Ea, A, DeltaH, DeltaS, DeltaG) for all thermal decomposition steps have been evaluated using Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity of the ligand and its complexes were studied against Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and pathogenic fungi Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) method.
TI  - Phytochemistry and Preliminary Assessment of the Antibacterial Activity of Chloroform Extract of Amburana cearensis (Allemao) A.C. Sm. against Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Strains.
AB  - The chloroform extract of the stem bark of Amburana cearensis was chemically characterized and tested for antibacterial activity.The extract was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The main compounds identified were 4-methoxy-3-methylphenol (76.7%), triciclene (3.9%), alpha -pinene (1.0%), beta -pinene (2.2%), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3.1%). Preliminary antibacterial tests were carried out against species of distinct morphophysiological characteristics: Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determinate in 96-well microplates for the chloroform extract and an analogue of themain compound identified, which was purchased commercially.We have shown that plant's extract was only inhibitory (but not bactericidal) at the maximum concentration of 6900 mu g/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Conversely, the analogue 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol produced MICs ranging from215 to 431 mu g/mL against all bacterial species.New antibacterial assays conducted with such chemical compound against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains have shown similarMICresults and minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) of 431 mu g/mL.We conclude that A. cearensis is a good source of methoxy-methylphenol compounds,which could be screened for antibacterial activity againstmultiresistant bacteria fromdifferent species.
TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of diverse pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - With the aim of developing a general and practical method for library production, a novel and efficient two-phase microwave-assisted cascade reaction between isatins and beta-ketoamides in [Bmim]BF4/toluene was developed for the synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones. The features of this methodology are, the use of microwave-assisted rapid synthesis, mild reaction conditions, high yields, operational simplicity, facile product separation, and recyclability. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-dione derivatives produced were evaluated against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus). These derivatives showed antibacterial activities against Gram-positive strains that were at least equivalent to that against Gram-negative strains. Compound 7{3,5} displayed the most potent antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL) and greater activity than standard ampicillin (MIC = 1 mug/mL). Compound 7{4,7} exhibited the best inhibitory activity against E. coli and E. aerogenes (MIC = 1 and 0.5 mug/mL), compared with the standard ampicillin (both MICs = 1 mug/mL). The synthesized pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones are expected to be widely used as lead compounds for the development of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial Activities and In Vitro Anti-Inflammatory (Membrane Stability) Properties of Methanolic Extracts of Gardenia coronaria Leaves.
AB  - This work is carried out with Gardenia coronaria leaves that belong to the family Rubiaceae, which is a small-to-medium-sized but tall, deciduous tree, 7.6-9 m high on an average. Leaves are used for the treatment of rheumatic pain and bronchitis. The leaf of the plant consists of coronalolide, coronalolic acid, coronalolide methyl ester, ethyl coronalolate acetate triterpenes (secocycloartanes), and so forth. Methanol extract from the leaves of Gardenia coronaria was completely screened for membrane stability and antibacterial activity. The lower concentrations of Methanolic leaf extract of Gardenia coronaria gave good antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, but higher concentrations gave relatively more projecting antibacterial activity in vitro as compared with Kanamycin. The crude drug's anti-inflammatory effects were compared with those of Aspirin as positive control. The Methanolic extracts of Gardenia coronaria leaves possessed a broad spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms like Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Shigella sonnei, Shigella boydii, and Proteus mirabilis, with a zone of inhibition from 10 to 16 mm. The extract also showed good membrane stability to be considered as having significant anti-inflammatory action.
TI  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Delphinium denudatum root extract exhibits antibacterial and mosquito larvicidal activities.
AB  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous root extract of Delphinium denudatum (Dd) by reduction of Ag(+) ions from silver nitrate solution has been investigated. The synthesized DdAgNPs were characterized by using UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The prepared DdAgNPs showed maximum absorbance at 416nm and particles were polydispersed in nature, spherical in shape and the size of the particle obtained was85nm. The DdAgNPs exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus cereus NCIM 2106, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027. The DdAgNPs showed potent larvicidal activity against second instar larvae of dengue vector Aedes aegypti with a LC50 value of 9.6ppm.
TI  - Tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  - Binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. Hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. The present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. The results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. We hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. The alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. Bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. These findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.
TI  - Diffusible signal factor (DSF) quorum sensing signal and structurally related molecules enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extensive use of antibiotics has fostered the emergence of superbugs  that are resistant to multidrugs, which becomes a great healthcare and public concern. Previous studies showed that quorum sensing signal DSF (diffusible signal factor) not only modulates bacterial antibiotic resistance through intraspecies signaling, but also affects bacterial antibiotic tolerance through interspecies communication. These findings motivate us to exploit the possibility of using DSF and its structurally related molecules as adjuvants to influence antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: In this study, we have demonstrated that DSF signal and its structurally related molecules could be used to induce bacterial antibiotic susceptibility. Exogenous addition of DSF signal (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid) and its structural analogues could significantly increase the antibiotic susceptibility of Bacillus cereus, possibly through reducing drug-resistant activity, biofilm formation and bacterial fitness. The synergistic effect of DSF and its structurally related molecules with antibiotics on B. cereus is dosage-dependent. Combination of DSF with gentamicin showed an obviously synergistic effect on B. cereus pathogenicity in an in vitro model. We also found that DSF could increase the antibiotic susceptibility of other bacterial species, including Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Neisseria subflava and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a promising potential of using DSF and its structurally related molecules as novel adjuvants to conventional antibiotics for treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Colloidal polyaniline dispersions: antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and neutrophil oxidative burst.
AB  - Polyaniline colloids rank among promising application forms of this conducting polymer. Cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst tests were performed on cells treated with colloidal polyaniline dispersions. The antibacterial effect of colloidal polyaniline against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was most pronounced for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 3,500 mug mL(-1). The data recorded on human keratinocyte (HaCaT) and a mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH/3T3) cell lines using an MTT assay and flow cytometry indicated a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of colloid, with the absence of cytotoxic effect at around 150 mug mL(-1). The neutrophil oxidative burst test then showed that colloidal polyaniline, in concentrations <150 mug mL(-1), was not able to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils and whole human blood. However, it worked efficiently as a scavenger of those already formed.
TI  - Antibacterial potency of housefly larvae extract from sewage sludge through bioconversion.
AB  - Use of the fly to convert sewage sludge into nutrient-rich soil conditioner and amendment is an attractive approach for sludge bioconversion. During this process, fecal coliforms, an indicating pathogen, in sludge were reduced to 5.3 x 10(2) most probable number/g dry solid from initial 3.32 x 10(6) MPN/g dry solid. It was also found that the extract of larvae grown in sludge during bioconversion have an observable inhibitory effect against bacteria compared to larvae grown in wheat bran as measured by minimum bacterial concentration tests. In vitro antimicrobial assay tests over time also showed that the extract had strong inhibitory efficiencies of ca. 99% against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, while the efficiency was 69% and 57% against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. The observed pathogenic bacterial cell membrane damage was found to be responsible for the phenomenon mentioned above, with nuclear acids leaching out quickly and alkaline phosphatase increasing in the outer membrane, followed by an increase of beta-galactosidase in the inner membrane. Clearly, housefly larvae extract from sewage sludge through bioconversion possesses antibacterial potency against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Influence of phenolic compounds of Kangra tea [Camellia sinensis (L) O Kuntze] on bacterial pathogens and indigenous bacterial probiotics of Western Himalayas.
AB  - Phenolic compounds of nutraceutical importance viz., catechins (C), (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) were estimated in fresh green tea shoots of Camellia sinensis (L) O Kuntze cultivar. The total polyphenols and total catechins were in the range of 219.90 to 317.81 and 140.83 to 271.39 g/kg, respectively in monthly samples of tea. The values of C, EC, EGC, EGCG and ECG in tea powders as analyzed through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were in the range of 1.560 to 3.661, 13.338 to 27.766, 26.515 to 39.597, 62.903 to 102.168 and 18.969 to 39.469 mg/g, respectively. Effect of tea extracts and standard flavanols against five pathogenic bacteria viz., Listeria monocytogenes (MTCC-839), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC-741), Bacillus cereus (MTCC-1272), Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC-96) and Escherichia coli (MTCC-443), and eleven indigenous potential bacterial probiotics belonging to genera Enterococcus, Bacillus and Lactobacillus spp. obtained from fermented foods of Western Himalayas, was investigated. EGCG, ECG and EGC exhibited antibacterial activity but, C and EC did not show this activity. Tea extracts having high concentrations of EGCG and ECG were more potent in antibacterial action against bacterial pathogens. Tea extracts and standard flavan-3-ols augmented viability of potential probiotics in an order of EGCG > EGC > ECG > EC > C. Tea extracts and standard flavanols had no antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (MTCC-443) but, in combination with probiotic culture supernatants, this activity was seen. The Kangra tea thus, exerts antibacterial effect on bacterial pathogens through EGCG, ECG and EGC constituents while stimulatory effect on growth of indigenous potential probiotics.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological studies of substituted quinozoline-4-(3H)-ones containing diazepine moiety.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of new series of 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives have been presented. The structures were confirmed by elemental analyses, IR spectral, (1)H NMR spectral and mass spectral data. All the compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities. The antibacterial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive), Bacillus cereus (Gram positive), Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram negative). The antifungal activity was tested against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. All the compounds showed considerable antimicrobial activity against the microorganism studied. The significant anthelmintic activity of all novel compounds was demonstrated against Pheretima posthuma. Based on the nature of substituent present, the structure-activity correlation of novel compounds was discussed.
TI  - Further in vitro evaluation of antiradical and antimicrobial activities of phytol.
AB  - The antiradical activity of phytol was evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance towards hydroxyl radical (.OH), superoxide anion radical (.O2(-)), methoxy radical (.CH2OH), carbon-dioxide anion radical (.CO2(-)), as well as towards nitric-oxide radical (.NO) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (.DPPH) radical. It reduced the production of all tested radicals showing more promising activity against .CO2(-), .CH2OH and .DPPH radicals (56%, 50% and 48%, respectively) in comparison with .NO, .O2(-) and .OH radicals (38%, 23% and 15%, respectively). The antimicrobial activity of phytol was evaluated by the microdilution method against eight bacterial and eight fungal strains. To varying degrees, it was proven to be active against all tested bacteria and fungi (MIC 0.003-0.038 mg/mL and MBC 0.013-0.052 mg/mL, MIC 0.008-0.016 mg/mL and MFC 0.090-0.520 mg/mL, respectively). According to the obtained results, medical foods containing phytol may support development of new therapies for heart disease.
TI  - Effects of Methanol Extract of Wedelia chinensis Osbeck (Asteraceae) Leaves against Pathogenic Bacteria with Emphasise on Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the methanol extract of Wedelia chinensis leave was studied and tested against three pathogenic Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Stapylococcus aureus) and three pathogenic Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by the disk diffusion assay and broth dilution methods. The extract exhibited favourable antibacterial activity against the bacterial cells but was more potent against Gram positive bacteria with the minimum inhibition concentration of 3.12 to 6.25 mg/ml compared to the Gram negative bacteria which had minimum inhibition concentration values of 25 mg/ml. The time-kill study suggested that the extract possessed bactericidal properties at higher concentrations and eradicated the growth of bacterial cells. The major abnormalities occurred to the bacterial cells after exposed to the extract were complete alterations in their morphology and collapsed of the cells beyond repair. The methanol extract of W. chinensis may be an effective antibacterial agent to treat bacterial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Haplophytin B from Maclurodendron porteri.
AB  - An alkaloid from Maclurodendron porteri has been isolated and characterized. Extraction process was conducted by acid-base extraction method followed by column chromatography. The structure was established by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The compound was identified as haplophytin B which occurs commonly in the Rutaceae family. However, this is the first time this alkaloid was isolated and reported from the species. The compound showed no inhibition against Staphylococus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli and no cytotoxic activity against H199 and A549 cell lines.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 2-alkynoic fatty acids against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The first study aimed at determining the structural characteristics needed to prepare antibacterial 2-alkynoic fatty acids (2-AFAs) was accomplished by synthesizing several 2-AFAs and other analogs in 18-76% overall yields. Among all the compounds tested, the 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-HDA) displayed the best overall antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=15.6 mug/mL), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (MIC=15.5 mug/mL), and Bacillus cereus (MIC=31.3 mug/mL), as well as against the Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8 mug/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC=125 mug/mL). In addition, 2-HDA displayed significant antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300 (MIC=15.6 mug/mL) and clinical isolates of MRSA (MIC=3.9 mug/mL). No direct relationship was found between the antibacterial activity of 2-AFAs and their critical micelle concentration (CMC) suggesting that the antibacterial properties of these fatty acids are not mediated by micelle formation. It was demonstrated that the presence of a triple bond at C-2 and the carboxylic acid moiety in 2-AFAs are important for their antibacterial activity. 2-HDA has the potential to be further evaluated for use in antibacterial formulations.
TI  - Lipids, proteins, phenolic composition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities  of seeds of peanuts (Arachis hypogaea l) cultivated in Tunisia.
AB  - Fatty acid composition of peanut seed oil in four varieties cultivated in Tunisia showed that linoleic (C18:2), oleic (C18:1) and palmitic (C16) acids account for more than 84% for Chounfakhi and Massriya and for more than 85% of the total fatty acids of Trabilsia and Sinya seed oil respectively. Seed oil contents were significantly different (P </= 0.05) and did not exceed 48%. The study of total phenolics revealed that Chounfakhi contained more total phenolics (2.1 mg GAE/g DW), followed by the Massriya and Sinya cultivars (1.35 mg GAE/g DW for each); Trabilsia presented the lowest total phenolic content with 1 mg GAE/g DW. Considerable antiradical ability was found, especially in the Trabilsia peanut seed cultivar (IC50 = 1550 mug/ml), the Massriya and Sinya cultivars had, respectively, 720 and 820 mg/ml IC50. In the Massriya variety the sterol fraction showed antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii, Listeria inocua, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococus aureus, Enterococcus hirae and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Bio-augmentation as a tool for improving the modified sequencing batch biofilm reactor.
AB  - Biological treatment of domestic sewage was accomplished in a pilot-scale modified sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR) bio-augmented with consortium of 5 strains of indigenous bacteria (genus Pseudomonas and Bacillus). The reactor consisted of fibrous filler in the upper and ceramsite filter media in the bottom. It demonstrated to have a short hydraulic residence time (HRT) for 10 h and good quality effluent to cope with low C/N ratio domestic wastewater. The biofilm attached fibrous fillers mainly contributed to contaminants removal. Bio-augmentation dramatically enhanced the removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and especially total nitrogen (TN), which increased respectively from 80.3%, 58.1% and 41.3% to 83.7%, 67.8% and 58.7%. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique indicated the 5 strains' survival in the reactor and that Bacillus cereus strain ZQN2 was the most dominant bacteria.
TI  - Synergy of antibacterial and antioxidant activities from crude extracts and peptides of selected plant mixture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A plant mixture containing indigenous Australian plants was examined  for synergistic antimicrobial activity using selected test microorganisms. This study aims to investigate antibacterial activities, antioxidant potential and the content of phenolic compounds in aqueous, ethanolic and peptide extracts of plant mixture. METHODS: Well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays were used to test antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays were used to evaluate antioxidant activity. HPLC and gel filtration were used for purification of the peptides. Scanning electron microscope was applied to investigate the mode of attachment of the peptides on target microbial membranes. RESULTS: Aqueous extraction of the mixture showed no inhibition zones against all the test bacteria. Mean diameter of inhibition zones for ethanol extraction of this mixture attained 8.33 mm, 7.33 mm, and 6.33 mm against S. aureus at corresponding concentrations of 500, 250 and 125 mg/ml while E .coli showed inhibition zones of 9.33 mm, 8.00 mm and 6.66 mm at the same concentrations. B. cereus exhibited inhibition zones of 11.33 mm, 10.33 mm and 10.00 mm at concentrations of 500, 250 and 125 mg/ml respectively. The peptide extract demonstrated antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and B. cereus. The MIC and MBC values for ethanol extracts were determined at 125 mg/ml concentration against S. aureus and E. coli and B. cereus value was 31.5 mg/ml. MIC and MBC values showed that the peptide extract was significantly effective at low concentration of the Australian plant mixture (APM). Phenolic compounds were detected in hot aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the plant mixture. Hot aqueous, ethanol and peptides extracts also exhibited antioxidant activities. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that APM possessed good antibacterial and antioxidant activities following extraction with different solvents. The results suggest that APM provide a new source with antibacterial agents and antioxidant activity for nutraceutical or medical applications.
TI  - The long-term effects of phage concentration on the inhibition of planktonic bacterial cultures.
AB  - Since the early 1920s there has been an interest in using bacteriophages (phages) for the control of bacterial pathogens. While there are many factors that have limited the success of phage bio-control, one particular problem is the variability of outcomes between phages and bacteria. Specifically, there is a significant need for a better understanding of how initial phage concentrations affect long-term bacterial inhibition. In work reported herein three phages were isolated for Escherichia coli K12, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, as well as Bacillus cereus and bio-control experiments were performed with phage concentrations ranging from 10(5) to 10(8) plaque forming units per mL over the course of 72 h. For four of the nine phages isolated there was a linear relationship between inhibition and phage concentration, suggesting the effect of phage concentration is important at longer time scales. For three of the isolated phages, phage concentrations had no effect on bacterial inhibition suggesting that even at the lowest concentration the method of action was saturated and lower concentrations might still be effective. Additionally, a cocktail was created and was compared to the previously isolated phages. There was no statistical difference between the cocktail and the best performing phage highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate phages for treatment. These results suggest that, for certain phages, there is a strong relationship between phage concentration and long-term bacterial growth inhibition and the initial phage concentration is an important indicator of the long-term outcome.
TI  - Development of new active packaging film made from a soluble soybean polysaccharide incorporated Zataria multiflora Boiss and Mentha pulegium essential oils.
AB  - An active edible film from soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) incorporated with different concentrations of Zataria multiflora Boiss (ZEO) and Mentha pulegium (MEO) essential oils was developed, and the film's optical, wettability, thermal, total phenol and antioxidant characteristics were investigated, along with their antimicrobial effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. The film's colour became darker and more yellowish and had a lower gloss as the levels of ZEO or MEO were increased. Antioxidant activity of the films was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays. DPPH was reduced in the range of 19.84-74.12% depending on the essential oil type and concentration. Film incorporated with 3% (v/v) ZEO showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (IC50=4188.60+/-21.73mg/l and EC50=8.86+/-0.09mg/ml, respectively), compared with the control and MEO added film. Films containing ZEO were more effective against the tested bacteria than those containing MEO. S. aureus was found to be the most sensitive bacterium to both ZEO or MEO, followed by B. cereus and E. coli. A highest inhibition zone of 387.05mm(2) was observed for S. aureus around the films incorporated with 3% (v/v) ZEO. The total inhibitory zone of 3% (v/v) MEO formulated films was 21.98 for S. typhimurium and 10.15mm(2) for P. aeruginosa. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed a single glass transition temperature (Tg) between 16 and 31 degrees C. The contact angle increased up to 175% and 38% as 3% (v/v) of ZEO or MEO used: it clearly shows that films with ZEO were more hydrophobic than those with MEO. The results showed that these two essential oils could be incorporated into SSPS films for food packaging.
TI  - Fusarial wilt control and growth promotion of pigeon pea through bioactive metabolites produced by two plant growth promoting rhizobacteria.
AB  - The bioactive metabolites produced by two plant growth promoting rhizobacteria strains, a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain RRLJ 04 and a Bacillus cereus strain BS 03, which showed growth promotion and disease control in pigeon pea against Fusarium udum, were isolated and screened for their efficacy to control fusarial wilt of pigeon pea under gnotobiotic and nursery condition. Bioactive metabolites viz., BM 1 and BM 2 from RRLJ 04 and BM 3 from BS 03 also showed in vitro antibiosis against F. udum. Seeds treated with 50 mul seed(-)(1) of BM 1, 30 mul seed(-)(1) of BM 2 and 70 mul seed(-)(1) of BM 3 and grown in pathogen infested soil showed suppression of wilt disease besides growth enhancement. Per cent disease control was 90 % with BM 2 application as compared to 87 and 83 %, respectively in BM 1 and BM 3 after 90 days of growth. BM 2 treated plants were more resistant to the pathogen as compared to the other fractions tested. Mycelial dry weight was found to be reduced on treatment with the bioactive metabolites. Formation of chlamydospore-like structures was observed in the pathogen mycelium treated with BM 3. The analytical studies confirmed that two of these metabolites are phenazine derivatives.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Phyllantus emblica, Coriandrum sativum, Culinaris medic, Lawsonia alba and Cucumis sativus.
AB  - Present study deals with the demonstration of the antibacterial activity of very  common medicinal plants of Pakistani origin i.e., Phyllantus emblica, Coriandrum sativum, Culinaris medic, Lawsonia alba and Cucumis sativus. The extracts were prepared in crude form by the use of hydro-alcoholic solution and were screened for antibacterial activity against various bacterial species by disk diffusion method. Assay was performed using clinical isolates of B. cereus, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. coli. Crude extract of Phyllantus emblica fruit exhibited strong activity against standard cultures of all studied bacteria. Lawsonia alba showed good activity against standard cultures of all the used microorganisms. Coriandrum sativum was effective only against Bacillus cereus, while Cucumis sativus and Culinaris medic showed poor activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa only. Hence, Phyllantus emblica exhibited strong antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria it means that Phyllantus emblica extract contains some compounds which have broad spectrum of bactericidal activity.
TI  - Potential cellular targets and antibacterial efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma.
AB  - Atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) has been gaining increasing interest as a new alternative antibacterial approach. Although this approach has demonstrated promising antibacterial activity, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Mechanistic elucidation of the antimicrobial activity will facilitate development and rational optimisation of this approach for potential medical applications. In this study, the antibacterial efficacy of an in-house-built APNTP jet was evaluated alongside an investigation of the interactions between APNTP and major cellular components in order to identify the potential cellular targets involved in plasma-mediated bacterial destruction mechanisms. The investigated plasma jet exhibited excellent, rapid antibacterial activity against a selected panel of clinically significant bacterial species including Bacillus cereus, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of which were completely inactivated within 2 min of plasma exposure. Plasma-mediated damaging effects were observed, to varying degrees, on all of the investigated cellular components including DNA, a model protein enzyme, and lipid membrane integrity and permeability. The antibacterial efficacy of APNTP appears to involve a multiple-target mechanism, which potentially reduces the likelihood of emergence of microbial resistance towards this promising antimicrobial approach. However, cellular membrane damage and resulting permeability perturbation was found to be the most likely rate-determining step in this mechanism.
TI  - Volatile analysis and antimicrobial screening of the parasitic plant Cuscuta reflexa Roxb. from Nepal.
AB  - The essential oil from the parasitic vine Cuscuta reflexa Roxb., collected from Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal, was obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. From a total of 62 peaks, 61 compounds were identified in the oil, accounting for 99.6% of the oil. The majority of the essential oil was dominated by the relatively rare component cis-3-butyl-4-vinylcyclopentane (26.4%). The oil also contained substantial amounts of limonene (5.1%) and (E)-nerolidol (9.5%). Biological screening for antimicrobial activities did not show appreciable activity against either Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) or Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. However, marginal activity against Aspergillus niger was observed (minimum inhibitory concentration = 313 mug/mL).
TI  - Comparison of antibacterial activity of Ag nanoparticles synthesized from leaf extract of Parthenium hystrophorus L in aqueous media and Gentamicin sulphate: in-vitro.
AB  - Monodisperse silver (Ag) nanoparticles were synthesized by using Parthenium hystrophorus L leaf extract in aqueous media. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by using UV-vis spectrophotometer, X-ray diffracto-meter (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and dynamics light scattering (DLS). Size-dependent antibacterial activities of Ag nanoparticles were tested against Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus. Ag nanoparticles having 20 +/- 2 nm size in diameter show maximum zone of inhibition (23 +/- 2.2 mm) in comparison to 40 nm and 70 nm diameter nanoparticles for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The zone of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus were 19 +/- 1.8 mm, 15 +/- 1.5 mm and 11 +/- 1 mm for 20 nm, 40 nm, and 70 nm, respectively. In addition, affect of concentration of 20 nm size Ag nanoparticles on Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus species were also reported and results were compared with 10 microg/ml dose of Gentamicin sulphate. The Parthenium hystrophorus L leaf extract capped 20 +/- 2 nm Ag nanoparticles (7.5 microg/ml) shows statistically significant antibacterial activity than Gentamicin sulphate (10 microg/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial Property of Extracts of Indian Lichen against Human Pathogenic Bacteria.
AB  - Context. Usnea ghattensis G. Awasthi (Usneaceae) endemic fruticose lichen found growing luxuriantly in Northern Western Ghats of India, it also contains Usnic acid as a major chemical and tested against some human pathogenic bacteria. Objective. To explore antimicrobial properties of Usnea ghattensis against some human pathogenic bacteria. Materials and Methods. The lichen was extracted in acetone, methanol, and ethanol. In vitro antimicrobial activity was tested initially by Kirby-Bauer technique of disc diffusion method and was confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration using Broth microdilution method according to the NCCLS guidelines. Results. Ethanol extract was most effective against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a zone of inhibition 29.8 +/- 0.6 mm and 12.3 +/- 0.5 mm diameters at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. Acetone and methanol extract demonstrated almost similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus and the zone of inhibition was 24.6 +/- 0.5 and 24.7 +/- 0.4 mm. Only methanol extract was showing activity against Streptococcus faecalis with a 13.5 +/- 0.8 mm zone. MIC value noted against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis was 6.25 mu g/mL and 25 mu g/mL, whereas against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MIC calculated was 3.125 mu g/mL and 200 mu g/mL, respectively. Conclusion. The present study demonstrates the relatively higher activity of this lichen against not only gram (+) but significantly also against gram (-) bacteria. This indicates that this lichen might be a rich source of effective antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of polyhalobenzonitrile quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives.
AB  - A novel series of polyhalobenzonitrile quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives were synthesized and characterized by NMR, IR, MS, and HRMS spectra. All of the newly prepared compounds were screened for antimicrobial activities against four strains of bacteria (Gram-positive bacterial: Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus; Gram-negative bacterial: Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and one strain of fungi (Candida albicans). Among the synthesized compounds, 5-(dimethylamino)-8-(2,4,5-trichloro-isophthalonitrile) quinazolin-4(3H)-one (7k) exhibited significant activity towards Gram-positive bacterial, Gram-negative bacterial, and the fungi strains. The MIC (0.8-3.3mug/mL) and MBC (2.6-7.8mug/mL) for this compound were close to those of nofloxacin, chlorothalonil, and fluconazole, making it the most potent antimicrobial agents in the series.
TI  - [Identification of a denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organism (DPAO) and  study on its denitrifying functional genes].
AB  - A denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organism (DPAO) was isolated and identified, and the denitrifying functional genes were investigated. The strain ZQN2 was isolated using denitrifying medium. It was distinguished as DPAO by tests of aerobic phosphorus uptake, nitrate reduction, metachromatic granules and PHB (poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate) granules dyeing. Test of anaerobic phosphorus release/anoxic phosphorus uptake showed that strain ZQN2 released phosphorus and synthesized PHB at the anaerobic phase and used NO3- as acceptor to oxidize PHB during the anoxic phase with luxury phosphorus uptake, performing the function of simultaneous denitrifying phosphorus removal. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain ZQN2 was used for homology analysis and construction of phylogenetic trees. The results suggested that the 16S rRNA gene sequence of ZQN2 had up to 99% homology with those of many strains of Bacillus cereus strains in GenBank database. With physiological and biochemical reactions, the strain ZQN2 was identified as Bacillus cereus. The result of denitrifying functional gene study suggested that strain ZQN2 was the type of nirS+ and nirK-, which confirmed its denitrifying function from molecular biology point of view. Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of nirS gene of ZQN2 showed that it was closely related to many strains of Pseadomonas aeruginosa, which was different from the analysis results of the 16S rRNA.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil from leaves of  Moringa oleifera Lam. cultivated in Mozambique.
AB  - The antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) grown in Mozambique was investigated. The chemical composition was studied by means of GC and GC-MS analysis. Hexacosane (13.9%), pentacosane (13.3%) and heptacosane (11.4%) were the main components. Ultra High Performance Chromatography-DAD analysis detected the flavonoids quercetin (126 mug/g) and luteolin (6.2 mug/g). The essential oil exhibited a relatively low free radical scavenging capacity. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was assayed against two Gram-positive strains (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus), two Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and five fungal strains of agro-food interest (Penicillium aurantiogriseum, Penicillium expansum, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium digitatum, and Aspergillus niger spp.). B. cereus and P. aeruginosa, as well as the fungal strains were sensitive to the essential oil.
TI  - Durable contact active antimicrobial materials formed by a one-step covalent modification of polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and glass surfaces.
AB  - In this work we have applied a direct covalent linkage of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) to prepare a series of contact active antimicrobial surfaces based on widely utilized materials. Formation of antimicrobial polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-QAS), cellulose (cellulose-QAS) and glass (glass-QAS) surfaces was achieved by one step synthesis with no auxiliary linkers. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed tridentate binding mode of the antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial activity of the prepared materials was tested on Bacillus cereus, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Active site density of the modified materials was examined and found to correlate with their antimicrobial activity. Stability studies at different pH values and temperatures confirmed that the linkage of the bioactive moiety to the surface is robust and resistant to a range of pH and temperatures. Prolonged long-term effectiveness of the contact active materials was demonstrated by their repeated usage, without loss of the antimicrobial efficacy.
TI  - Metal based pharmacologically active agents: synthesis, structural characterization, molecular modeling, CT-DNA binding studies and in vitro antimicrobial screening of iron(II) bromosalicylidene amino acid chelates.
AB  - In recent years, great interest has been focused on Fe(II) Schiff base amino acid complexes as cytotoxic and antitumor drugs. Thus a series of new iron(II) complexes based on Schiff bases amino acids ligands have been designed and synthesized from condensation of 5-bromosalicylaldehyde (bs) and alpha-amino acids (L-alanine (ala), L-phenylalanine (phala), L-aspartic acid (aspa), L-histidine (his) and L-arginine (arg)). The structure of the investigated iron(II) complexes was elucidated using elemental analyses, infrared, ultraviolet-visible, thermogravimetric analysis, as well as conductivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Moreover, the stoichiometry and the stability constants of the prepared complexes have been determined spectrophotometrically. The results suggest that 5-bromosalicylaldehyde amino acid Schiff bases (bs:aa) behave as dibasic tridentate ONO ligands and coordinate to Fe(II) in octahedral geometry according to the general formula [Fe(bs:aa)2].nH2O. The conductivity values between 37 and 64 ohm(-1) mol(-1) cm(2) in ethanol imply the presence of nonelectrolyte species. The structure of the complexes was validated using quantum mechanics calculations based on accurate DFT methods. Geometry optimization of the Fe-Schiff base amino acid complexes showed that all complexes had octahedral coordination. In addition, the interaction of these complexes with (CT-DNA) was investigated at pH=7.2, by using UV-vis absorption, viscosity and agarose gel electrophoresis measurements. Results indicated that the investigated complexes strongly bind to calf thymus DNA via intercalative mode and showed a different DNA binding according to the sequence: bsari>bshi>bsali>bsasi>bsphali. Moreover, the prepared compounds are screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against three types of bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and three types of anti fungal cultures, Penicillium purpurogenium, Aspergillus flavus and Trichotheium rosium. The results of these studies indicated that the metal complexes exhibit a stronger antibacterial and antifungal efficiency than their corresponding Schiff base amino acid ligands.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - Three different bacterial detection systems for platelet concentrates under inter-laboratory conditions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A variety of screening methods are currently used worldwide in order  to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis and improve the safety of PCs. METHODS/MATERIALS: PCs inoculated with five different transfusion-relevant species of bacteria at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)ml(-1) were stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. Flow cytometry (FACS), BacT/Alert automated culturing, and a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) were then used to detect the presence of bacteria in samples prepared from these PCs. RESULTS: At the initial spiking concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 CFU ml(-1), Q-PCR detected all five bacterial species tested. Screening with the BacT/Alert culture-based system allowed bacterial detection (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 15.13 h for all three spiking concentrations. Using FACS, positive signals were obtained for all three concentrations of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus on day 1 and for initial spiking concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus of 1 CFU ml(-1) on day 2. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, detection of an initial inoculum of 1 CFU ml(-1) was possible only beginning on day 6. CONCLUSION: This study shows that under standard laboratory conditions the sensitivity of FACS in the detection of bacterial contamination of PCs was lower than that of either the BacT/Alert automated culturing method or Q-PCR.
TI  - Isolation and screening of bioactive principle from Chaetomorpha antennina against certain bacterial strains.
AB  - Microbial pathogens develop resistance to a particular antibiotic after repeated  administration during the treatment of infectious diseases. Moreover, multiple drug resistance is a very common problem especially in hospital acquired infections. Therefore, it is necessary to find out alternative antibacterial drugs and the present trend is focused on seaweeds. This preliminary research work was carried out to find out the antibacterial activity of petroleum ether extract of Chaetomorpha antennina. The extracts were tested against Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 121, Bacillus cereus MTCC 492, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 530, Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 779 by agar well diffusion technique. It was observed that petroleum ether extract showed prominent zone of inhibition against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus even at 50 mug/ml concentration. The maximum spectrum of activity was observed against Staphylococcus aureus ranged from 7.3 +/- 0.8 to 18 +/- 2.4 mm at the concentration 50 to 500 mug/ml, respectively. Hence the most susceptible bacterium was Staphylococcus aureus among the tested organisms. However, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also susceptible. But the Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae are resistant against the tested extract.
TI  - Enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. We have recently shown that synthetic antimicrobial peptides named PD1-PD4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of Arg-Trp (RW1-RW5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. In the present study, we selected PD3, PD4, RW2, RW3 and RW4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. Stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. Analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. The peptide combinations (RW2 + RW4, RW2 + RW3 + RW4 and PD4 + RW3 + RW4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 muM. Time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. The present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - A concise synthesis and antimicrobial activity of a novel series of naphthylpyridine-3-carbonitrile compounds.
AB  - A novel series of acyclic nucleosides 2-5 and 13a-c were synthesized by utilizing 4-phenyl-6(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropridine-3-carbonitrile (1) as a key starting material. Chlorination of 1 yielded the chloro analogue 6 that was allowed to react with urea, thiourea, thiosemicarbazide and alicyclic secondary amines to produce the corresponding derivatives 7a-c and 11a-c. Further condensation of 6 with various amino acids provided the compounds 8-10, whereas hydrazinolysis of 6 yielded the hydrazinyl analogue 12 which was condensed with different isothiocyanates and acid anhydrides to afford derivatives 18-20, respectively. Upon treatment of 12 with sodium nitrite, the azide derivative 14 was obtained which was subjected to reaction with various active methylene compounds to obtain the corresponding triazolo derivatives 15-17. The structure assignment of the new compounds is based on chemicaland spectroscopic evidence. Antimicrobial evaluation of the newly synthesized derivatives was performed using ciprofloxacin and fluconazole as reference antibacterial and antifungal drugs. The most effective compounds against the tested bacterial and fungal isolates were the benzothiohydrazide compound 18b followed by the hydrazone and the phthalic anhydride derivatives 13c and 20, respectively.
TI  - Microchip-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism for on-site analysis of bacterial communities in freshwater.
AB  - Assessing microbiological quality assurance by monitoring bacteria in various sources of freshwater used for human consumption, recreation, and food preparation is important for a healthy life. Bacterial number and their community structure in freshwater should be determined as quickly as possible, and "real-time" and "on-site" microbiological methods are required. In this study, we examined the protocol for microchip-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, which uses microchip electrophoresis for rapid microbial community analysis. The availability of microchip-based T-RFLP was compared with conventional T-RFLP analysis, which uses a capillary electrophoresis system, with freshwater samples (spring water, river water, groundwater, and hydroponics solution). The detection limit of targeted bacteria by on-chip T-RFLP analysis was 1% (10(3) cells/mL). The fragment sizes determined by the two analysis methods were highly correlated (r(2)=0.98). On-chip T-RFLP analysis was completed within 15 min. T-RFLP profiles of nine hydroponics solution samples were analyzed by multidimensional scaling. Considerable changes and stability in bacterial community structure during hydroponic culture were detected by both analyses. These results show that on-chip T-RFLP analysis can monitor changes in bacterial community structure, as well as conventional T-RFLP analysis. The present results indicate that on-chip T-RFLP analysis is an effective tool for rapid and "on-site" bacterial community profiling in freshwater environments, as well as freshwater used for medical and industrial purposes.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity and Phytochemical Constituents of Leaf Extracts of Cassia  auriculata.
AB  - Plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'For centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. In the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of Cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). The aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'Zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). The extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. The antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. Further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from Cassia auriculata.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected Malaysian honey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of honey is mainly dependent on a combination  of its peroxide activity and non-peroxide components. This study aims to investigate antibacterial activity of five varieties of Malaysian honey (three monofloral; acacia, gelam and pineapple, and two polyfloral; kelulut and tualang) against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were performed for semi-quantitative evaluation. Agar well diffusion assay was used to investigate peroxide and non-peroxide activities of honey. RESULTS: The results showed that gelam honey possessed lowest MIC value against S. aureus with 5% (w/v) MIC and MBC of 6.25% (w/v). Highest MIC values were shown by pineapple honey against E. coli and P. aeruginosa as well as acacia honey against E. coli with 25% (w/v) MIC and 50% (w/v) MBC values. Agar inhibition assay showed kelulut honey to possess highest total antibacterial activity against S. aureus with 26.49 equivalent phenol concentrations (EPC) and non-peroxide activity of 25.74 EPC. Lowest antibacterial activity was observed in acacia honey against E. coli with total activity of 7.85 EPC and non-peroxide activity of 7.59 EPC. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the total antibacterial activities and non-peroxide activities of Malaysian honey. The intraspecific correlation between MIC and EPC of E. coli (r = -0.8559) was high while that between MIC and EPC of P. aeruginosa was observed to be moderate (r = -0.6469). S. aureus recorded a smaller correlation towards the opposite direction (r = 0.5045). In contrast, B.cereus showed a very low intraspecific correlation between MIC and EPC (r = -0.1482). CONCLUSIONS: Malaysian honey, namely gelam, kelulut and tualang, have high antibacterial potency derived from total and non-peroxide activities, which implies that both peroxide and other constituents are mutually important as contributing factors to the antibacterial property of honey.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of novel nanocomposite films of chitosan/phosphoramide/Fe3O4 NPs.
AB  - New nanocomposite films of chitosan/phosphoramide/1-5% Fe3O4 NPs were prepared. The Fe3O4 NPs were synthesized as core-shell NPs with starch as a capping agent. The phosphoramide compound was synthesized from the reaction of morpholine with N-4-nitrophenyl phosphoramidic dichloride. The XRD and SEM analysis of Fe3O4 NPs, chitosan (CS), phosphoramide (Ph), CS/Ph and CS/Fe3O4 NPs films as well as the nanocomposite films 1-5 containing CS/Ph/1-5% Fe3O4 NPs were investigated and the results confirmed the formation of the desired films. The in vitro antibacterial activities were evaluated against four bacteria including two Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) and two Gram-negative Escherchia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) bacteria. Results indicated greater antibacterial effects for the films against Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, nanocomposite films containing higher percent of Fe3O4 NPs displayed more antibacterial activities.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Biological activity, design, synthesis and structure activity relationship of some novel derivatives of curcumin containing sulfonamides.
AB  - Five series of curcumin derivatives with sulfonamides 3a-3e, 4a-4e, 5a-5e, 6a-6e  and 7a-7e have been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against selected medically important gram-(+) and gram-(-) bacterial species viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and antifungal activity against few pathogenic fungal species viz. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Trichoderma viride and Curvularia lunata. The cytotoxicity has been determined by measuring IC50 values against human cell lines HeLa, Hep G-2, QG-56 and HCT-116. Among the compounds screened, 3a-3e showed the most potent biological activity against tested bacteria and fungi. Compounds 3a-3e displayed higher cytotoxicity than curcumin. The curcumin derivatives were also evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. In contrast, the compounds 6a-6e and 7a-7e showed dramatically decrease in biological activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Design, characterization, teratogenicity testing, antibacterial, antifungal and DNA interaction of few high spin Fe(II) Schiff base amino acid complexes.
AB  - In this study, new Fe(II) Schiff base amino acid chelates derived from the condensation of o-hydroxynaphthaldehyde with L-alanine, L-phenylalanine, L-aspartic acid, L-histidine and L-arginine were synthesized and characterized via elemental, thermogravimetric analysis, molar conductance, IR, electronic, mass spectra and magnetic moment measurements. The stoichiometry and the stability constants of the complexes were determined spectrophotometrically. Correlation of all spectroscopic data suggested that Schiff bases ligands exhibited tridentate with ONO sites coordinating to the metal ions via protonated phenolic-OH, azomethine-N and carboxylate-O with the general formulae [Fe(HL)2].nH2O. But in case of L-histidine, the ligand acts as tetradentate via deprotonated phenolic-OH, azomethine-N, carboxylate-O and N-imidazole ring ([FeL(H2O)2].2H2O), where HL=mono anion and L=dianion of the ligand. The structure of the prepared complexes is suggested to be octahedral. The prepared complexes were tested for their teratogenicity on chick embryos and found to be safe until a concentration of 100 mug/egg with full embryos formation. Moreover, the interaction between CT-DNA and the investigated complexes were followed by spectrophotometric and viscosity measurements. It was found that, the prepared complexes bind to DNA via classical intercalative mode and showed a different DNA activity with the sequence: nhi>nari>nali>nasi>nphali. Furthermore, the free ligands and their complexes are screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activity against three types of bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and three types of anti fungal cultures, Penicillium purpurogenium, Aspergillus flavus and Trichotheium rosium in order to assess their antimicrobial potential. The results show that the metal complexes are more reactive with respect to their corresponding Schiff base amino acid ligands.
TI  - Study of the Interference between Plectranthus Species Essential Oils from Brazil and Aminoglycosides.
AB  - Plectranthus is one of the most representative genera of Lamiaceae family. In this study, the essential oils from Plectranthus amboinicus, Plectranthus ornatus, and Plectranthus barbatus were investigated for their chemical composition and antimicrobial and modulatory activities. The major components found were carvacrol (54.4%-P. amboinicus) and eugenol (22.9%-P. ornatus e 25.1%-P. barbatus). In vitro antimicrobial activity was conducted against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant) using microdilution method. The results of bioassay showed that all strains were sensitive to the oils, except P. aeruginosa that was resistant to P. amboinicus and P. ornatus. A synergistic effect of all essential oils combined with the aminoglycosides was demonstrated. These results show that P. amboinicus, P. ornatus, and P. barbatus inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganism, and besides this they present antibiotic modifying activity, providing a new perspective against the problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.
TI  - Biochemical composition, antimicrobial activities,and anti-quorum-sensing activities of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts from Hypericum connatum Lam. (Guttiferae).
AB  - We studied the polyphenol composition and antioxidant activity of the ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of Hypericum connatum (Guttiferae), in addition to their antimicrobial and antiquorum-sensing (AQS) properties. The extracts exhibited a similar polyphenol content and a notable antioxidant activity, which was stronger in the ethanolic extract (EC50=3.2 mug/mL). Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed different polyphenol profiles, with rutin and apigen being the main components of the ethanolic extract and caffeic acid, (-)-epicatechin and p-coumaric acid being abundant in the ethyl acetate extract. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited a more effective antimicrobial activity than the ethanolic extract against the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the first time, AQS activity was detected in H. connatum: the ethanolic extract inhibited the production of violacein, a quorum-sensing-regulated pigment, in a Chromobacterium violaceum tester strain, without interfering with its growth.
TI  - Volatile constituents of Pinus roxburghii from Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pinus roxburghii Sarg. Is one of 3 species of pine found in Nepal, the oil of which is traditionally used to treat cuts, wounds, boils, and blisters. OBJECTIVE: To obtain, analyze, and examine the anti-microbial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oils of P. roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three plant parts (cone, needle, and bark) of Pinus roxburghii were collected in Biratnagar, Nepal. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation, and the chemical compositions were determined by GC-MS. The needle and cone essential oils were screened for anti-microbial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Aspergillus niger; brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality; and in-vitro cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis for the cone oil revealed 81 compounds with 78 components being identified (95.5% of the oil) while 98.3% of needle oil was identified to contain 68 components and 98.6% of the bark oil (38 components) was identified. The 3 essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpenes, particularly (E)-caryophyllene (26.8%-34.5%) and alpha-humulene (5.0%-7.3%) as well as monoterpene alcohols terpinen-4-ol (4.1%-30.1%) and alpha-terpineol(2.8%-5.0%). The monoterpene delta-3-carene was present only in needle and cone essential oils (2.3% and 6.8%, respectively). Bio-activity assays of the cone essential oil of P. roxburghii showed remarkable cytotoxic activity (100% killing of MCF-7 cells at 100 mug/mL) along with notable brine shrimp lethality (LC50 =11.8 mug/mL). The cone essential oil did not show anti-bacterial activity, but it did exhibit anti-fungal activity against Aspergillus niger (MIC=39 mug/mL). CONCLUSION: The bioactivity of P. roxburghii essential oil is consistent with its traditional medicinal use.
TI  - Biogenesis of antibacterial silver nanoparticles using the endophytic bacterium Bacillus cereus isolated from Garcinia xanthochymus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the ecofriendly nanoparticles, which is viewed as an alternative to the chemical method which initiated the use of microbes like bacteria and fungi in their synthesis. METHODS: The current study uses the endophytic bacterium Bacillus cereus isolated from the Garcinia xanthochymus to synthesize the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The AgNPs were synthesized by reduction of silver nitrate solution by the endophytic bacterium after incubation for 3-5 d at room temperature. The synthesis was initially observed by colour change from pale white to brown which was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The AgNPs were further characterized using FTIR, SEM-EDX and TEM analyses. RESULTS: The synthesized nanoparticles were found to be spherical with the size in the range of 20-40 nm which showed a slight aggregation. The energy-dispersive spectra of the nanoparticle dispersion confirmed the presence of elemental silver. The AgNPs were found to have antibacterial activity against a few pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The endophytic bacteria identified as Bacillus cereus was able to synthesize silver nanoparticles with potential antibacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of mangrove plant Sonneratia alba.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial property of mangrove plant Sonneratia alba (S. alba). METHODS: The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using disc diffusion and microdilution methods against six microorganisms. Soxhlet apparatus was used for extraction with a series of solvents, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol in sequence of increasing polarity. RESULTS: Methanol extract appeared to be the most effective extract while n-hexane extract showed no activity. The antimicrobial activities were observed against the gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), the gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans appeared to be not sensitive to the concentrations tested since no inhibition zone was observed. E. coli (17.5 mm) appeared to be the most sensitive strain followed by S. aureus (12.5 mm) and B. cereus (12.5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: From this study, it can be concluded that S. alba exhibits antimicrobial activities against certain microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Synthesis of 1-isopropyl-3-acyl-5-methyl-benzimidazolone derivatives and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A series of N-acylated analogues of 1-isopropyl-3-acyl-5-methyl-benzimidazolone were synthesized. Bioassay results indicated that analogues 5-07 and 5-19 exhibited the most potency against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Analogues 5-02, 5-07, 5-12, 5-15, 5-19, 5-20 and 5-25 could effectively inhibit the spore germination of Botrytis cinerea. The relationship between structure and their antimicrobial activity (SAR) has also been discussed according to aliphatic acids and aromatic acids derivatives, respectively. This implied that the N-acylated derivatives of 5-methyl-benzimidazolone might be potential antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Antagonistic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from apparently healthy and osteoporotic women].
AB  - Antagonistic activity of 74 cultures of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from healthy and osteoporotic women-patients aged 50-79 years, has been studied. It has been shown that the inhibitory effect of the strain studied was independent of the health of women (control group of women or patients with osteoporosis), but had strain specificity. Seventeen most active strains of lactobacilli, which showed the highest inhibitory activity against B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, P. vulgaris were selected. Only 6 strains of lactobacillus demonstrated specific antagonistic activity against the test-strains.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of polyhalo isophthalonitrile derivatives.
AB  - A series of polyhalo isophthalonitrile derivatives (3 and 4) that incorporate a variety of substituents at the 2-, 4-, 5- and/or 6-positions of the isophthalonitrile moieties have been designed and synthesized. These derivatives were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus (Gram-positive bacteria), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria); and Candida albicans (Fungi). Compounds 3 and 4 showed stronger inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi growth, and the antimicrobial ability of compound 3j (a 4-(benzylamino)-5-chloro-2,6-difluoro analog, MIC[SA] = 0.5 mug/mL; MIC[BC] = 0.4 mug/mL; MIC[CA] = 0.5 mug/mL) were close to nofloxacin and fluconazole and identified as the most potent antimicrobial agents in the series. The preliminary analysis of structure-activity relationships is also discussed.
TI  - Airborne microbial composition in a high-throughput poultry slaughtering facility.
AB  - A high-throughput chicken slaughtering facility in Beijing was systematically investigated for numbers of airborne microorganisms. Samples were assessed for counts of aerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella. During a 4-month period (September to December 2011), samples were collected for 10 min three times daily (preproduction, production, and postproduction). Samples were collected for three consecutive days of each month with an FA-1 sampler from six sampling sites: receiving-hanging, soaking-scalding and defeathering, evisceration, precooling, subdividing, and packing. Humidity, temperature, wind velocity, and airborne particulates also were recorded at each sampling site and time. The highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, i.e., the receiving-hanging and defeathering areas, with a definite decline toward the evisceration, prechilling, subdividing, and packing areas; the prechilling area had the lowest microbial counts of 2.4 x 10(3) CFU/m(3). Mean total coliforms counts ranged from 8.4 x 10(3) to 140 CFU/m(3). Maximum E. coli counts were 6.1 x 10(3) CFU/m(3) in the soaking-scalding and defeathering area. B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus represented only a small proportion of the microbial population (1,900 to 20 CFU/m(3)). L. monocytogenes and Salmonella were rarely detected in evisceration, precooling, subdividing, and packing areas. Our study identified the levels of bioaerosols that may affect chicken product quality. This finding could be useful for improved control of microbial contamination to ensure product quality.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (SHMG) and edetate disodium (EDTA), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. METHODS: In vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Using different concentrations of SHMG alone or in combination with EDTA, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. In addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% SHMG and 0.1% EDTA as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of SHMG ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. Susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of EDTA substantially increased the SHMG activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. The preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. All the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the U.S. Pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. All products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the European Pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. With regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria of the European Pharmacopeia were fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (SHMG/EDTA) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.
TI  - Copper(II) triflate promoted multicomponent catalytic clubbing of piperazinyl-thiazoloquinolines and thiazolocoumarins as antimicrobials.
AB  - Step economical, multicomponent construction of two series based on quinoline and coumarin ring systems was carried out. Annulation towards the 2-piperazinylthiazole system was established in satisfactory yields, using copper(II) triflate. These multicomponent reaction products were examined for their potential inhibitory effect against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two fungal species (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans). In vitro pharmacological screening data demonstrated that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial (25-50 microg/mL of MIC) potential and the results were comparable to control drugs. The structural assignments of final products were done on the basis of IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) was explored to facilitate further development of this class of compounds.
TI  - Characterization of an atmospheric pressure plasma jet and its applications for disinfection and cancer treatment.
AB  - In this work an atmospheric pressure non-thermal resistive barrier (RB) plasma jet was constructed, characterized and was applied for biomedical applications. The RB plasma source can operate in both DC (battery) as well as in standard 60/50 Hz low frequency AC excitation, and it functions effectively in both direct and indirect plasma exposure configurations. The characteristics of the RB plasma jet such as electrical properties, plasma gas temperature and nitric oxides concentration were determined using voltage-current characterization, optical emission spectroscopy and gas analyzer diagnostic techniques. Plasma discharge power of 26.33 W was calculated from voltage-current characterization. An optical emission spectroscopy was applied and the gas temperature which is equivalent to the nitrogen rotational (T<inf>rot</inf>) temperatures was measured. The concentrations of the reactive oxygen species at different spatial distances from the tip of the plasma jet were measured and the ppm concentration of NO is at the preferred level for a wide range of standard biomedical treatment applications. The ppm values of nitric oxides after the cooling unit are observed to be of the same order of magnitude as compared to plasma jet. The portable RB plasma source was tested to be very effective for decontamination and disinfection of a wide range of foodborne and opportunistic nosocomial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and the preliminary results are presented. The effects of indirect exposure of the portable RBP source on monocytic leukemia cancer cells (THP-1) were also tested and the results demonstrate that a preference for apoptosis in plasma treated THP-1 cells under particular plasma parameters and dosage levels.
TI  - [Analysis of bactericidal material generated by electrical devices advertising bactericidal ability against bacteria on the agar gel plates].
AB  - Several Japanese companies sell electrical devices advertised as effective in inactivating viruses and killing bacteria by releasing special materials, e.g., Plasmacluster ions, Nanoe particle and minus ions, into the air. These companies claim that their devices killed bacteria on plates in their own experiments. We tested device effectiveness using the same experiments from the Plasmacluster ioniser SHARP Co., Japan, the Nanoe generator Panasonic Co., Japan, and the Vion KING JIM Co., Japan, to test their advertising claims. Bactericidal ability on agar plate was tested, using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis as follows: the medium containing a certain amount of each bacterium was put onto an agar plate and smeared. Plates were kept in a closed chamber (inner volume 14.4 m3) or a glove box (inner volume 0.2 m), with one of the devices run for 2 hours. Plates not exposed to any device were used as controls. Each plate was retrieved and put in an incubator to count the number of bacterial colonies formed on the plate. There was no significant difference in the number of colonies on plates exposed to devices compared to control, in the number for all devices, or in all bacteria tested in experiments in the 14.4 m3 chamber. These results strongly suggest that these devices have almost no bactericidal effect, at least in space exceeding this volume. Colony formation was suppressed in the glove box in all devices and in all bacteria tested except P. aeruginosa, although the degree of suppression differed among experiments. The colony formation suppression mechanism was analyzed, and indicated that:colony formation did not change even after the removal of Plasmacluster ions, Nanoe particles, or negative ions from the air, while colony formation was decreased drastically by the removal of ozone from space, which was revealed to be generated inevitably during device operation. These results strongly suggest that the bactericidal effect seen only on the agar plate in narrow space was explained by ozone released in space as a by-product, not by special materials as advertising claimed. It is thus important to analyze the effect of special materials such as those done in this study and to suggest the involvement of ozone as the true cause, as have been done in this study, in evaluating bactericidal effect or viral inactivation as advertised by these companies.
TI  - Transport and retention of selected engineered nanoparticles by porous media in the presence of a biofilm.
AB  - Column experiments were conducted to investigate the transport of aqueous C60 (aqu-nC60), fullerol, silver nanoparticles (NPs) coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (Ag-PVP) and stabilized by citrate (Ag-CIT) in biofilm-laden porous media. Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Gram-positive Bacillus cereus (BC) biofilm-laden glass beads were selected to represent the bacterial interfaces NPs might encounter in the natural aquatic environment. The biomass distribution, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) components, electrokinetic property, and hydrophobicity of these interfaces were characterized, and the hydrophobicity was found to correlate with the quantity of proteins in EPS. The retention of NPs on glass beads coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and alginate were also studied. Except for Ag-PVP, the affinity of NPs for porous medium, indicated by attachment efficiency alpha, increased in the presence of biofilms, BSA and alginate. For hydrophobic aqu-nC60, the larger the proteins/polysaccharides ratio, the larger the alpha, suggesting the hydrophobic interaction determines the attachment of aqu-nC60 to the collector surface. Uncharged PVP stabilized Ag-PVP by steric repulsion, and the attachment to glass beads was not enhanced by biofilm. The presence of divalent ion Ca(2+) significantly hydrophobized biofilm, BSA, and alginate-coated glass beads and further retarded the mobility of aqu-nC60, fullerol, and Ag-CIT; while Ag-PVP was again sterically stabilized.
TI  - Design, synthesis, antimicrobial activity and anti-HIV activity evaluation of novel hybrid quinazoline-triazine derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel hybrid quinazoline-triazine derivatives was designed and synthesized from cyanuric chloride and anthranilic acid through sequential reactions, which contain different pharmacophores like quinazoline and substituted diaryl triazine (DATA) linked with ethylene diamine. All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by infrared, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Further, we evaluated the in vitro anti-HIV activity of the newly synthesized compounds against HIV-1 (IIIB) and HIV-2 (ROD) viral strains and as well as in vitro antimicrobial activity against four bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two fungi (Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) using the paper agar streak dilution method. The bioassay results indicate that four compounds namely 7d, 7n, 7r and 7s could be considered as possible potential agents.
TI  - The insect Galleria mellonella as a powerful infection model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  - The study of bacterial virulence often requires a suitable animal model. Mammalian models of infection are costly and may raise ethical issues. The use of insects as infection models provides a valuable alternative. Compared to other non-vertebrate model hosts such as nematodes, insects have a relatively advanced system of antimicrobial defenses and are thus more likely to produce information relevant to the mammalian infection process. Like mammals, insects possess a complex innate immune system(1). Cells in the hemolymph are capable of phagocytosing or encapsulating microbial invaders, and humoral responses include the inducible production of lysozyme and small antibacterial peptides(2,3). In addition, analogies are found between the epithelial cells of insect larval midguts and intestinal cells of mammalian digestive systems. Finally, several basic components essential for the bacterial infection process such as cell adhesion, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, tissue degradation and adaptation to oxidative stress are likely to be important in both insects and mammals(1). Thus, insects are polyvalent tools for the identification and characterization of microbial virulence factors involved in mammalian infections. Larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella have been shown to provide a useful insight into the pathogenesis of a wide range of microbial infections including mammalian fungal (Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans) and bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes or Enterococcus faecalis(4-7). Regardless of the bacterial species, results obtained with Galleria larvae infected by direct injection through the cuticle consistently correlate with those of similar mammalian studies: bacterial strains that are attenuated in mammalian models demonstrate lower virulence in Galleria, and strains causing severe human infections are also highly virulent in the Galleria model(8-11). Oral infection of Galleria is much less used and additional compounds, like specific toxins, are needed to reach mortality. G. mellonella larvae present several technical advantages: they are relatively large (last instar larvae before pupation are about 2 cm long and weight 250 mg), thus enabling the injection of defined doses of bacteria; they can be reared at various temperatures (20 degrees C to 30 degrees C) and infection studies can be conducted between 15 degrees C to above 37 degrees C(12,13), allowing experiments that mimic a mammalian environment. In addition, insect rearing is easy and relatively cheap. Infection of the larvae allows monitoring bacterial virulence by several means, including calculation of LD50(14), measurement of bacterial survival(15,16) and examination of the infection process(17). Here, we describe the rearing of the insects, covering all life stages of G. mellonella. We provide a detailed protocol of infection by two routes of inoculation: oral and intra haemocoelic. The bacterial model used in this protocol is Bacillus cereus, a Gram positive pathogen implicated in gastrointestinal as well as in other severe local or systemic opportunistic infections(18,19).
TI  - Synthesis, pharmacological activity evaluation and molecular modeling of new polynuclear heterocyclic compounds containing benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - Novel heterocyclic compounds containing benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized from 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) acetonitrile (1) and arylhydrazononitrile derivative 2 was obtained via coupling of 1 with 4-methyl phenyldiazonium salt, which was then reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to give amidooxime derivative 3. This product was cyclized into the corresponding oxadiazole derivative 4 upon reflux in acetic anhydride. Compound 4 was refluxed in DMF in the presence of triethylamine to give the corresponding 5-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-2-p-tolyl-2H-1,2,3-triazol-4-amine 6. Treatment of compound 6 with ethyl chloroformate afforded 2,6-dihydro-2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,2,3-triazolo[4",5"-4',5']pyrimido[1,6-a]benzimid azole-5(4H)-one (8). 1,2-bis(2-cyanomethyl-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)ethane-1,2-dione (10) was synthesized via the condensation reaction of 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) acetonitrile (1) and diethyloxalate. The reactivity of compound 10 towards some diamine reagents was studied. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds was investigated against several pathogenic bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli O119, S. paratyphi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus. The results of MIC revealed that compounds 12a-c showed the most effective antimicrobial activity against tested strains. On the other hand, compounds 12a, b exhibited high activity against rotavirus Wa strain while compounds 12b, c exhibited high activity against adenovirus type 7. In silico target prediction, docking and validation of the compounds 12a-c were performed. The dialkylglycine decarboxylase bacterial enzyme was predicted as a potential bacterial target receptor using pharmacophore-based correspondence with previous leads; giving the highest normalized scores and a high correlation docking score with mean inhibition concentrations. A novel binding mechanism was predicted after docking using the MOE software and its validation.
TI  - Essential oil of Mitracarpus frigidus as a potent source of bioactive compounds.
AB  - In our previous work (Fabri et al. 2009), we showed that different extracts of Mitracarpus frigidus had significant antibacterial, antifungal and leishmanicidal activities. In order to increase our knowledge about this species, this work assesses the chemical composition and the in vitro biological activity of its essential oil. Thus, the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation of the aerial parts of M. frigidus was analyzed by GC/MS. Among several compounds detected, 11 were identified, being linalool and eugenol acetate the major components. The essential oil exhibited a moderate antibacterial effect against Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC 250 microg/mL). On the other hand, it showed a strong antifungal effect against Cryptoccocus neoformans (MIC 8 microg/mL) and Candida albicans (MIC 63 microg/mL). Expressive activity against L. major and L. amazonensis promastigote forms with IC50 values of 47.2 and 89.7 microg/mL, respectively, were also observed. In addition, the antioxidant activity was investigated through DPPH radical-scavenging and showed a significative activity with IC50 of 38 microg/mL. The cytotoxicity against Artemia salina was moderate with LC(50) of 88 microg/mL. The results presented here are the first report on the chemical composition and biological properties of M. frigidus essential oil.
TI  - Role of the moth fly Clogmia albipunctata (Diptera: Psychodinae) as a mechanical  vector of bacterial pathogens in German hospitals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The formerly Mediterranean moth fly species Clogmia albipunctata (Diptera: Psychodidae) is now present in Germany, where it has become a common, year-round pest in hospital buildings. AIM: To investigate the potential of C. albipunctata to transport and transmit bacterial pathogens in infested German hospitals. METHODS: From June 2011 to May 2012, 271 adult C. albipunctata were collected from four infested hospitals and analysed qualitatively and, in part, quantitatively, for bacterial colonization. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for selected nosocomial pathogens. FINDINGS: Forty-five bacterial species representing 40 genera were found to be colonizing C. albipunctata. Among the bacteria isolated were Acinetobacter baumannii, Aeromonas hydrophila, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, with colonization rates of 0-17.5%, 0-16.7%, 0-12.5%, 0-62.1%, 0-2.5%, 0-4.1%, 0-12.5%, 0-7.6% and 0-10%, respectively. Additionally, one strain of both Yersinia frederiksenii and Nocardia spp. was detected. Unlike 11 strains of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) S. maltophilia collected from one hospital, no MDR Enterobacteriaceae were isolated. Acinetobacter spp. colonized C. albipunctata at rates from 2.9% to 36.8%, and revealed a high affinity for the exoskeleton, with up to 2080 colony-forming units per moth fly for A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: C. albipunctata is a potential mechanical vector of bacterial pathogens associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - Design, structural and spectroscopic elucidation, and the in vitro biological activities of new diorganotin dithiocarbamates.
AB  - The reaction of 2,2-dimethoxy-N-methylethyllamine or 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane with  CS(2) in alkaline media produced two novel dithiocarbamate salts. Subsequent reactions with organotin halides yielded six new complexes: [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (1), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (2), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (3), [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (4), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (5), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (6), where R = methyl, R(1) = CH(2)CH(OMe)(2), and R(2) = 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane. All compounds were identified in terms of infrared, (1)H and (13)C NMR, and the complexes were also characterized using (119)Sn NMR, (119)Sn Mossbauer and X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of all derivatives has been screened in terms of IC(90) and IC(50) against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Penicillium citrinum, Curvularia senegalensis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the results correlated well with a performed study of structure-activity relationship (SAR). Complexes (3), (5) and (6) displayed the best IC(90) and IC(50) in the presence of the fungi, greater than that of miconazole, used as control drug.
TI  - Bacterial quorum sensing: its role in virulence and possibilities for its control.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a process of cell-cell communication that allows bacteria to share information about cell density and adjust gene expression accordingly. This process enables bacteria to express energetically expensive processes as a collective only when the impact of those processes on the environment or on a host will be maximized. Among the many traits controlled by quorum sensing is the expression of virulence factors by pathogenic bacteria. Here we review the quorum-sensing circuits of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae. We outline these canonical quorum-sensing mechanisms and how each uniquely controls virulence factor production. Additionally, we examine recent efforts to inhibit quorum sensing in these pathogens with the goal of designing novel antimicrobial therapeutics.
TI  - Rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using GreenLight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria innocua) were analysed. For each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. Analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. CONCLUSION: The microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.
TI  - Chemical composition and antioxidative activity of Echinophora platyloba DC. essential oil, and its interaction with natural antimicrobials against food-borne pathogens and spoilage organisms.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the chemical composition and antioxidative capacity of Echinophora platyloba DC. essential oil, and its antimicrobial potency against Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Rhodotorula rubra, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. The essential oil was analyzed by GC and GC-MS; and evaluated for its antioxidative and antimicrobial (singly or in combination with chitosan, nisin, monolaurin, or amphotericin B) activity. Thirty-three components were characterized representing 95.69% of the total oil composition in which thymol, trans-ocimene, carvacrol, and (E)-sesqui-lavandulol were the major constituents. The oil exhibited high scavenging (IC(50): 49.7 +/- 2.3 mug/mL) and relative antioxidative activity (RAA%: 85.21 +/- 0.4) in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals and beta-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching assays, respectively. The oil showed antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes, B. cereus, B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, R. Rubra, and R. mucilaginosa. Moreover, R. mucilaginosa and P. aeruginosa were the most susceptible and most resistant organisms, respectively. Regarding the checkerboard data, 47 fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICIs) (</= 0.5) indicated synergistic, whereas 7 FICIs (>0.5 to 1) indicated additive effect. Consequently, E. platyloba DC. essential oil could be used as a recommended natural antioxidant and antimicrobial substance for food preservation.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Salvia x jamensis essential oil.
AB  - This is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of Salvia x jamensis. The major compounds identified by GC-MS were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). The oil showed antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+) bacteria: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis, and three Candida strains: C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three Gram (-) bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition profile of grape (Vitis vinifera) pomace extracts obtained by supercritical fluids.
AB  - The possibility of increasing the aggregated value of the huge amount of residues generated by wineries around the world foment studies using the grape pomace - the residue from the wine production, composed by seed, skin and stems - to obtain functional ingredients. Nowadays, consumers in general prefer natural and safe products mainly for food and cosmetic fields, where the supercritical fluid extraction is of great importance due to the purity of the extracts provided. Therefore, the objective of this work is to evaluate the global extraction yield, the antimicrobial activity and the composition profile of Merlot and Syrah grape pomace extracts obtained by supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) and CO2 added with co-solvent at pressures up to 300 bar and temperatures of 50 and 60 degrees C. The results were compared with the ones obtained by Soxhlet and by ultrasound-assisted leaching extraction methods. The main components from the extracts, identified by HPLC, were gallic acid, p-OH-benzoic acid, vanillic acid and epicatechin. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were evaluated using four strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and three fungi strains (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei). Despite lower extraction yield results, the supercritical fluid extracts presented the highest antimicrobial effectiveness compared to the other grape pomace extracts due to the presence of antimicrobial active compounds. Syrah extracts were less efficient against the microorganisms tested and Merlot extracts were more active against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - [The changes of ocular bacterial isolates and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility in the past six years].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the changes of ocular bacterial isolates and their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and tobramycin in Henan Province in the past six years. METHODS: Retrospective study of ocular bacterial isolates and their in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results of Henan Eye Institute in the past six years. RESULTS: A total of 2044 bacterial isolates were classified into 39 kinds in the past six years, which were mainly from the conjunctival sac. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. All kinds of the ocular bacteria had the highest susceptibility to gatifloxacin (92.3%) among the tested drugs. Rods were more sensitive to quinolone drugs than cocci and gram-positive rods were more sensitive to tobramycin than the other types of germs. The drug's susceptibility of the four kinds of quinolone except ciprofloxacin decreased year by year with a decreasing ladder fashion every two years in the susceptibility change of levofloxacin in the past six years, while the susceptibility of tobramycin increased slowly from 2004 to 2008 and then decreased. Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptibility to every drug had the similar trend with the general changes in the past six years, that is, their susceptibility to ofloxacin decreased significantly since 2008, their susceptibility to gatifloxacin and tobramycin reduced significantly in 2009. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to all the drugs had no significant change, for all gram-negative rods, their susceptibility to the four kinds of quinolone drugs were higher than their susceptibility to tobramycin while their susceptibility to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin reduced significantly as time passed by, especially from the year 2008 to 2009. CONCLUSIONS: The most common ocular bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ocular bacterial isolates' susceptibility to gatifloxacin in vitro was significantly higher than to other drugs in every year but decreased significantly in 2009 while their susceptibility to ofloxacin and levofloxacin decreased significantly since 2008. Their susceptibility to tobramycin increased slowly from 2004 to 2008 and then decreased.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - Preparation, stability and antimicrobial activity of cationic cross-linked starch-iodine complexes.
AB  - Cationic cross-linked starch (CCS)-iodine complexes containing different amounts  of quaternary ammonium groups (different degrees of substitution (DS)) and iodine have been obtained by iodine adsorption on CCS from aqueous iodine potassium iodide solution. Equilibrium adsorption studies showed that with an increase of DS the amount of iodine adsorbed on CCS and the affinity of iodine to CCS increased linearly. The influences of the DS of CCS and the amount of adsorbed iodine on the stability of CCS-iodine complexes in a solution of 0.02M sodium acetate and reactivity toward l-tyrosine have been investigated. At the same DS, the stability of CCS-iodine complexes decreased with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. With increasing the DS, the stability of CCS-iodine complexes increased. The iodine consumption in the reaction with l-tyrosine increased significantly with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. The influence of DS on iodine consumption was lower and depended on the amount of adsorbed iodine. The antibacterial activity of CCS-iodine complexes against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was determined by the broth-dilution and spread-plate methods. The obtained results have demonstrated that an appropriate selection of the CCS-iodine complex composition (the DS of CCS and the amount of adsorbed iodine) could ensure good antimicrobial properties by keeping a low concentration of free iodine in the system. The main advantage of using CCS-iodine complexes as antimicrobial agents is the biodegradability of the polymeric matrix.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bioactive compounds and leaf extracts in Jatropha tanjorensis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Jatropha tanjorensis was investigated scientifically to generate evidence for the efficacies reported in traditional systems and the results are given here. METHODS: Different concentrations of the solvent extracts of leaves and four isolated compounds were tested against human pathogenic microorganisms such as gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, gram-negative bacteria of Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Vibrio alcaligenes, Vibrio cholerae and fungi of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton rubrum by agar-well diffusion and disk diffusion methods. RESULTS: In agar-well diffusion method, maximum activity was recorded in a concentration-dependent manner. The extracts recorded activity against bacteria such as 17-26, 15-25 and 13-24 mm to methanol extract and 15-24, 14-23 and 12-22 mm to chloroform extract at 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively and fungi such as 9-15 mm to A. fumigatus and 5-16 mm to T. rubrum. Maximum activity was 30-46, 27-43 and 17-40 mm to friedelin and 23-46, 28-44 and 18-41 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against bacteria and 12-37, 8-34 and 31-33 mm to friedelin and 12-40, 11-35 and 10-33 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against fungi at 10, 5 and 2.5mg respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that friedelin, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone present in the methanol extract could be responsible for the broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and provide scientific evidence.
TI  - Modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment of bacteria to abiotic surfaces and shrimp by Malaysian herb extracts.
AB  - The use of simple crude water extracts of common herbs to reduce bacterial attachment may be a cost-effective way to control bacterial foodborne pathogens, particularly in developing countries. The ability of water extracts of three common Malaysian herbs (Andrographis paniculata, Eurycoma longifolia, and Garcinia atroviridis) to modulate hydrophobicity and attachment to surfaces of five food-related bacterial strains (Bacillus cereus ATCC 14576, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) were determined. The bacterial attachment to hydrocarbon assay was used to determine bacterial hydrophobicity. Staining and direct microscopic counts were used to determine attachment of bacteria to glass and stainless steel. Plating on selective media was used to determine attachment of bacteria to shrimp. All extracts were capable of either significantly ( P < 0.05) increasing or decreasing bacterial surface hydrophobicity, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Bacterial attachment to all surfaces was either significantly (P < 0.05) increased or decreased, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Overall, hydrophobicity did not show a significant correlation (P > 0.05) to bacterial attachment. For specific combinations of bacteria, surface material, and plant extract, significant correlations (R > 0.80) between hydrophobicity and attachment were observed. The highest of these was observed for S. aureus attachment to stainless steel and glass after treatment with the E. longifolia extract (R = 0.99, P < 0.01). The crude water herb extracts in this study were shown to have the potential to modulate specific bacterial and surface interactions and may, with further work, be useful for the simple and practical control of foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of dextran stabilized silver nanoparticles in aqueous medium.
AB  - A simple one-step rapid synthetic route is described for the preparation of silver nanoparticles by reduction of silver nitrate (AgNO3) using aqueous dextran solution which acts as both reducing and capping agent. The formation of silver nanoparticles is assured by characterization with UV-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The absorbance of the silver nanoparticles is observed at 423 nm. The AFM image clearly shows the surface morphology of the well-dispersed silver nanoparticles with size range of 10-60 nm. TEM images show that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape with approximately 5-10 nm dimensions. The crystallinity of Ag nanoparticles is assured by XRD analysis. The antimicrobial activity of as synthesized silver nanoparticles is tested against the bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterial growth is inhibited by gradual reduction of the concentration of the silver nanoparticles.
TI  - A broad-range method to detect genomic DNA of multiple pathogenic bacteria based  on the aggregation strategy of gold nanorods.
AB  - It remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. This work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16S rDNA region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (GNRs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property. In the quantitative detection of artificial sequence, the limit of detection (LOD) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pM level. This pair of universal GNRs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (PCs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. Moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing Serratia marcescens-spiked PCs. Therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective DNA analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in PCs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.
TI  - Bioprospection and selection of bacteria isolated from environments contaminated  with petrochemical residues for application in bioremediation.
AB  - The use of microorganisms with hydrocarbon degrading capability and biosurfactant producers have emerged as an alternative for sustainable treatment of environmental passives. In this study 45 bacteria were isolated from samples contaminated with petrochemical residues, from which 21 were obtained from Landfarming soil contaminated with oily sludge, 11 were obtained from petrochemical industry effluents and 13 were originated directly from oily sludge. The metabolization capability of different carbon sources, growth capacity and tolerance, biosurfactant production and enzymes detection were determined. A preliminary selection carried out through the analysis of capability for degrading hydrocarbons showed that 22% of the isolates were able to degrade all carbon sources employed. On the other hand, in 36% of the isolates, the degradation of the oily sludge started within 18-48 h. Those isolates were considered as the most efficient ones. Twenty isolates, identified based on partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, were pre-selected. These isolates showed ability for growing in a medium containing 1% of oily sludge as the sole carbon source, tolerance in a medium containing up to 30% of oily sludge, ability for biosurfactant production, and expression of enzymes involved in degradation of aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Five bacteria, identified as Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila BB5, Bacillus megaterium BB6, Bacillus cibi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus BS20 were shown to be promising for use as inoculum in bioremediation processes (bioaugmentation) of areas contaminated with petrochemical residues since they can use oily sludge as the sole carbon source and produce biosurfactants.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of fatty acids detected in the hygroscopic secretion collected from the secretory setae of larvae of the biting midge Forcipomyia nigra (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae).
AB  - The hygroscopic secretion produced by the secretory setae of terrestrial larvae of the biting midge Forcipomyia nigra (Winnertz) was analysed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The viscous secretion is stored at the top of each seta and absorbs water from moist air. GC-MS analyses (four independent tests) showed that the secretion contained 12 free fatty acids, the most abundant of which were oleic (18:1), palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1) and linoleic (18:2). Other acids identified were valeric (5:0), enanthic (7:0), caprylic (8:0), pelargonic (9:0), capric (10:0), lauric (12:0), myristic (14:0) and stearic (18:0). Two other compounds, glycerol and pyroglutamic acid, were also found. The antibacterial activity of the fatty acids and pyroglutamic acid was tested using the agar disc diffusion method and targeted Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens). The antifungal activity was tested by determining minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of examined compounds. Fatty acids were tested against enthomopathogenic fungi (Paecilomyces lilacinus, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, Lecanicillium lecanii, Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana (Tve-N39), Beauveria bassiana (Dv-1/07)). The most effective acids against bacterial and fungal growth were C(9:0), C(10:0) and C(16:1), whereas C(14:0), C(16:0,) C(18:0) and C(18:1) demonstrated rather poor antifungal activity and did not inhibit the growth of bacteria. The antimicrobial assay investigated mixtures of fatty and pyroglutamic acids (corresponding to the results of each GC-MS test): they were found to be active against almost all the bacteria except P. fluorescens and also demonstrated certain fungistatic activity against enthomopathogenic fungi. The hygroscopic secretion facilitates cuticular respiration and plays an important role in the antimicrobial protection of F. nigra larvae living in moist terrestrial habitats.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial activity of 4H-pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole, pyrazole and benzylidene derivatives of curcumin.
AB  - A novel, one-pot, simple, efficient procedure for 4H-pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole (4a-h), pyrazole (6a-d) and benzylidene (7a-d) derivatives of curcumin under solvent and solvent free conditions in microwave with good yield is have been synthesized. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Providencia rettgeri and antifungal activity against fungi viz Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigates, Aspergillus flavus. Detailed mechanistic study shows reaction proceeds through Knoevenagel type intermediate 3a which has been suggested as key intermediate for reaction (Fig. 3).
TI  - Preliminary study on the antimicrobial activity of Enicostemma littorale using different solvents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the antimicrobial activity of Enicostemma littorale (E. littorale) using different solvents. METHODS: Chloroform, methanol and acetone extracts of different parts of E. littorale (leaf, stem and root) were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion method against some gram-negative species such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and gram-positive species Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and two fugal species viz., Aspergillus fumigates and Aspergillus flavus. RESULTS: The chloroform extracts showed the highest antibacterial activity. Among leaf, stem and root extracts, the stem extracts showed maximum antibacterial activity. All of the used extracts had no significant antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigates and Aspergillus flavus. The chloroform stem extract showed highest activity (about 20 mm inhibition zone) against Bacillus subtilis (at 500 mg/mL) followed by the methanolic stem extract which showed highest activity against the same organism. The lowest antibacterial activity was observed by the acetone leaf extract (about 8 mm inhibition zone) against Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicate littorale could also be a new source for antibiotics discovery.
TI  - Synthesis of s-triazine-based thiazolidinones as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A novel series of thiazolidinone derivatives, namely 4-{4-dimethylamino-6-[4-oxo-2-phenyl-5-(4-pyridin-2-yl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-thia zolidin-3-yl]-[1,3,5]-triazin-2-yloxy}-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-ones, have been synthesized from the key intermediate 4-(4-amino-6-dimethylamino-[1,3,5]-triazin-2-yloxy)-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-one (5). Compound 5 was condensed with various aldehydes to give Schiff base derivatives, which after cyclization gave thiazolidinones that were linked with 1-pyridin-2-yl-piperazine to obtain the target compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus).
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of 1-alkyl-3-methacryloyl (acryloyl) of benzimidazolone (thione) derivatives.
AB  - A series of (28) 1-alkyl-3-methacryloyl (acryloyl)-benzimidazolone (thione) deriv-atives were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives were confirmed by (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and ESI-MS spectral analysis. The antibacterial activities of these compounds against several strains of bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were evaluated by methods of paper disc-diffusion and broth mciro-dilution. Methacryloyl derivatives displayed higher antibacterial activities against tested bacterial strains than those of acryloyl derivatives in in vitro tests. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study revealed that the presences of the methacryloyl moieties is essential to the antibacterial activities of the compounds.
TI  - Investigations of antimicrobial activity of some Cameroonian medicinal plant extracts against bacteria and yeast with gastrointestinal relevance.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Resistance against antibiotics of many bacteria is accumulating. Therefore, searches for new substances with antimicrobial activity have become an urgent necessity. Medicinal plants are frequently used in popular medicine as remedies for many infectious diseases (intestinal infection, malaria, tuberculosis, etc.). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from different parts (leaves, stem bark, entire plant) of five different plant species against bacteria and yeast of gastrointestinal relevance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one extracts from all the following plants (Albizia gummifera (leaf), Ficus exasperata (leaf and stem bark), Nauclea latifolia (leaf and stem bark), Ricinodendron heudelotii (stem bark), Senna hirsuta (entire plant) have been screened for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria species including Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and one yeast species (Candida albicans) using agar disc-diffusion, and microbroth dilution assays. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that F. exasperata and N. latifolia were active against the whole set of tested microorganisms. The methanol extract of N. latifolia (leaf and stem bark) was the most active against against C. albicans, E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2, 32, 64 and 64 mug/ml, respectively. The methanol extract of leaf of F. exasperata was also most active with significant inhibitory activity against E. coli, S. dysenteriae, S. Typhi and P. aeruginosa with MIC values of 128 mug/ml. Only the extract of N. latifolia (stem bark and leaf) showed anticandidal property. CONCLUSION: The results show that these plant extracts exhibit antimicrobial activity and N. latifolia proved to be most effective as an antibacterial and antifungal.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - Development of metal-chelating inhibitors for the Class II fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase.
AB  - It has long been suggested that the essential and ubiquitous enzyme fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase could be a good drug target against bacteria and fungi, since lower organisms possess a metal-dependant (Class II) FBP aldolase, as opposed to higher organisms which possess a Schiff-base forming (Class I) FBP aldolase. We have tested the capacity of derivatives of the metal-chelating compound dipicolinic acid (DPA), as well a thiol-containing compound, to inhibit purified recombinant Class II FBP aldolases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, and from the Rice Blast causative agent Magnaporthe grisea. The aldolase from M. tuberculosis was the most sensitive to the metal-chelating inhibitors, with an IC(50) of 5.2 muM with 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate (DMPS) and 28 muM with DPA. DMPS and the synthesized inhibitor 6-(phosphonomethyl)picolinic acid inhibited the enzyme in a time-dependent, competitive fashion, with second order rate constants of 273 and 270 M(-1) s(-1) respectively for the binding of these compounds to the M. tuberculosis aldolase's active site in the presence of the substrate FBP (K(M) 27.9 muM). The most potent first generation inhibitors were modeled into the active site of the M. tuberculosis aldolase structure, with results indicating that the metal chelators tested cannot bind the catalytic zinc in a bidentate fashion while it remains in its catalytic location, and that most enzyme-ligand interactions involve the phosphate binding pocket residues.
TI  - Synthesis of benzimidazolyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2ylthio-N-phenyl (benzothiazolyl) acetamides as antibacterial, antifungal and antituberculosis agents.
AB  - To affiliate multiple bioactivities in a compact heteronuclei, two series of benzimidazole based 1,3,4-oxadiazoles were synthesized and assessed in vitro for their efficacy as antimicrobial agents against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri), four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and best results were observed amongst the N-benzothiazolyl aetamide series. The lipophilicity (LogP) influence on the biological profile (MICs) of the prepared products was also discussed. Upon biological screening, it was observed that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad spectrum antimicrobial (3.12-25 mug/mL of MIC) and antitubercular (6.25-25 mug/mL of MIC) potential. The structural assignments of the new products were done on the basis of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles against bacterial cells adhered to  stainless steel surfaces.
AB  - Given the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the need to synthesize new antimicrobials, silver has attracted interest in the scientific community because of its recognized antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (NP) obtained by a new method and tested at concentrations of 6 mug/ml and 60 mug/ml against the species Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Salmonella Choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus. The ability of these nanoparticles to remove or kill vegetative cells adhered to stainless steel surfaces was also evaluated. We observed that the NP obtained with the new method, concentrated silver nanoparticles (CNP), and silver nanoparticles with added sodium chloride (NPNaCl) had high antimicrobial activities (P < 0.05). We also verified that the most effective condition for the removal of P. aeruginosa cells on stainless steel coupons (10 by 10 mm) was immersion of the surfaces in CNP. The CNP treatment produced a 5-log reduction of the microbial population after 30 to 60 min of immersion. The CNP treatment also performed better than water and sodium carbonate, a compound commonly applied in clean-in-place procedures in the food industry, in removing adherent B. cereus cells from stainless steel cylinders. Therefore, these results suggest that NP synthesized by a new procedure may be used as antimicrobials in the food industry, for example, for the sanitization of utensils that come into contact with foods.
TI  - Phyto-synthesis of silver nanoscale particles using Morinda citrifolia L. and its inhibitory activity against human pathogens.
AB  - Leaf extract of Morinda citrifolia L. was assessed for the synthesis of silver nanoscale particles under different temperature and reaction time. Synthesized nanoscale (MCAgNPs) particles were confirmed by analysing the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using UV-visible spectrophotometer at 420 nm. Further SEM, HRTEM analysis confirmed the range of particle size between 10 and 60 nm and SEAD pattern authorizes the face centered cubic (fcc) crystalline nature of the MCAgNPs. Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) of synthesized MCAgNPs confirms the presence of high amount of phenolic compounds in the plant extract which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of nanoparticles. Further, inhibitory activity of MCAgNPs and plant extract were tested against human pathogens like Eschericia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus and Enterococci sp. The results indicated that the MCAgNPs showed moderate inhibitory actions against human pathogens than crude plant extract, demonstrating its antimicrobial value against pathogenic diseases.
TI  - A comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed UV radiation device.
AB  - Daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. However, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. This study evaluated a newly developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (UV) radiation device for its bactericidal activity in comparison with continuous UV-C, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin-resistant A. baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed UV or continuous UV-C. Pulsed UV and continuous UV-C required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2Log growth inhibition of all the species. The use of pulsed UV in daily disinfection of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. The new portable pulsed UV radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.
TI  - Semisynthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel guttiferone-A derivatives.
AB  - Six derivatives of guttiferone-A (LFQM-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 09548), Candida glabrata (ATCC 90030), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 69548), Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012), Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-A and they presented to be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. The current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-A possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Application of atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma for the in vitro eradication of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - The use of atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma represents an interesting and novel approach for the decontamination of surfaces colonized with microbial biofilms that exhibit enhanced tolerance to antimicrobial challenge. In this study, the influence of an atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma jet, operated in a helium and oxygen gas mixture under ambient pressure, was evaluated against biofilms of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Within < 4 min of plasma exposure, complete eradication of the two gram-positive bacterial biofilms was achieved. Although gram-negative biofilms required longer treatment time, their complete eradication was still possible with 10 min of exposure. Whilst this study provides useful proof of concept data on the use of atmospheric pressure plasmas for the eradication of bacterial biofilms in vitro, it also demonstrates the critical need for improved understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics related to such a potentially significant approach.
TI  - New heterocyclic compounds from 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole class bearing diphenylsulfone moieties. Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - Some new 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(R)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3(4H)-thiones 4a,b; 5a,b and 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(R)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines 6a,b; 7a,b were obtained by cyclization of new N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-(R)-thiosemicarbazides 2a,b; 3a,b (X=H, Br). The 1,2,4-triazoles were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of acylthiosemicarbazides, in basic media. On the other hand, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles were obtained from same acylthiosemicarbazides, in acidic media. These new intermediates from thiosemicarbazide class were afforded by the reaction of 4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoic acids hydrazides (X=H, Br) 1a,b with 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl isothiocyanate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. All the new compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 13061, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 49141, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and essential oils of Curcuma aeruginosa, Curcuma mangga,  and Zingiber cassumunar from Malaysia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the chemical composition of the essential oils of Curcuma aeruginosa (C. aeruginosa), Curcuma mangga (C. mangga), and Zingiber cassumunar (Z. cassumunar), and study their antimicrobial activity. METHODS: Essential oils obtained by steam distillation were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils was evaluated against four bacteria: Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa); and two fungi: Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Cyptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), using disc-diffusion and broth microdilution methods. RESULTS: Cycloisolongifolene, 8,9-dehydro formyl (35.29%) and dihydrocostunolide (22.51%) were the major compounds in C. aeruginosa oil; whereas caryophyllene oxide (18.71%) and caryophyllene (12.69%) were the major compounds in C. mangga oil; and 2,6,9,9-tetramethyl-2,6,10-cycloundecatrien-1-one (60.77%) and alpha-caryophyllene (23.92%) were abundant in Z. cassumunar oil. The essential oils displayed varying degrees of antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms. C. mangga oil had the highest and most broad-spectrum activity by inhibiting all microorganisms tested, with C. neoformans being the most sensitive microorganism by having the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values of 0.1 muL/mL. C. aeruginosa oil showed mild antimicrobial activity, whereas Z. cassumunar had very low or weak activity against the tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results suggest promising antimicrobial properties of C. mangga and C. aeruginosa, which may be useful for food preservation, pharmaceutical treatment and natural therapies.
TI  - Evaluation of the sterility testing process of hematopoietic stem cells at Canadian Blood Services.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sterility testing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at The Canadian  Blood Services Stem Cell Laboratory is performed using BacT/ALERT aerobic (SA) culture bottles. This study was conducted to verify the efficacy of this method and to assess the use of the BacT/ALERT aerobic (BPA) and anaerobic (BPN) culture bottles for microbial testing of HSCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: HSC products, including cryopreserved apheresis peripheral blood, marrow, and cord blood and fresh cord blood, were spiked with four aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis at a target concentration of 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. One to 2 mL of pre- and postspiked samples was inoculated into SA, BPA, and BPN bottles in duplicate and incubated for 5 to 10 days. The presence of the testing organisms in positive culture bottles was confirmed by plating on blood agar. RESULTS: The BacT/ALERT system detected the aerobic organisms in all HSCs in SA and BPA bottles within 34.1 hours while B. fragilis was detected only in BPN bottles within 68.6 hours. The mean recovered concentration of microorganisms in the HSC products ranged from 55 to 352 CFUs/mL with the exception of B. cereus, which was greater than 10(3) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the current sterility testing process at the Canadian Blood Services Stem Cell Laboratory detected the tested aerobic but not the anaerobic microbial contaminants in HSCs. The ability of the BacT/ALERT system using BPA and BPN bottles to detect bacterial contamination in HSCs was also demonstrated.
TI  - The additive and synergistic antimicrobial effects of select frankincense and myrrh oils--a combination from the pharaonic pharmacopoeia.
AB  - AIMS: The in vitro antimicrobial activity of three essential oil samples of frankincense (Boswellia rivae, Boswellia neglecta and Boswellia papyrifera) and two essential oil samples of myrrh and sweet myrrh (Commiphora guidotti and Commiphora myrrha), collected from different regions of Ethiopia, was investigated independently and in combination to determine their anti-infective properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: The microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay was performed, whereby it was noted that generally Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC values in the range of 0.8-1.4 mg ml(-1)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC values in the range of 0.5-1.3 mg ml(-1)) often appeared to be the most susceptible micro-organisms against oils of both Boswellia and Commiphora spp. When assayed in various combinations, the frankincense and myrrh oils displayed synergistic, additive and noninteractive properties, with no antagonism noted. When investigating different ratio combinations against Bacillus cereus, the most favourable combination was between B. papyrifera and C. myrrha. The composition of the oils was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to document the specific chemotypes used in the study, and the chemical profiles were found to be congruent with previously reported data. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of interactions identified synergistic and additive effects, with strong synergism noted between B. papyrifera and C. myrrha. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Frankincense and myrrh essential oils have been used in combination since 1500 bc; however, no antimicrobial investigations have been undertaken to confirm their effect in combination. This study validates the enhanced efficacy when used in combination against a selection of pathogens.
TI  - Milk microbiome signatures of subclinical mastitis-affected cattle analysed by shotgun sequencing.
AB  - AIMS: Metagenomic analysis of milk samples collected from Kankrej, Gir (Bos indicus) and crossbred (Bos taurus x B. indicus) cattle harbouring subclinical mastitis was carried out by next-generation sequencing 454 GS-FLX technology to elucidate the microbial community structure of cattle milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Milk samples from Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle were subjected to metagenomic profiling by pyrosequencing. The Metagenomic analysis produced 63.07, 11.09 and 7.87 million base pairs (Mb) of sequence data, assembled in 264 798, 56 114 and 36 762 sequences with an average read length of 238, 197 and 214 nucleotides in Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle, respectively. Phylogenetic and metabolic profiles by the web-based tool MG-RAST revealed that the members of Enterobacteriales were predominant in mastitic milk followed by Pseudomonadales, Bacillales and Lactobacillales. Around 56 different species with varying abundance were detected in the subclinically infected milk. Escherichia coli was found to be the most predominant species in Kankrej and Gir cattle followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Shigella flexneri and Bacillus cereus. In crossbred cattle, Staphylococcus aureus followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli were detected in descending order. Metabolic profiling indicated fluoroquinolones, methicillin, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium as the groups of antibiotics and toxic compounds to which the organisms showed resistance. Sequences indicating potential of organisms exhibiting multidrug resistance against antibiotics and resistance to toxic compounds were also present. Interestingly, presence of bacteriophages against Staph. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter and Yersinia species was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identified potential infectious organisms in mastitis, resistance of organisms to antibiotics and chemical compounds and the natural resistance potential of dairy cows. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this study may help in formulating strategies for the prevention and treatment of mastitis in dairy animals and consequently in reducing economic losses incurred because of it.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial properties of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of non-polymeric phenolic (NP) and polymeric tannin (PT) constituents in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of six brands of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total phenolic content (TPC) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) were assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteu and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. Minimum inhibitory dose (MID) against Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using the disc-diffusion method. Teas were extracted with hot water successively three times for one hour each time. The extracts were fractionated using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to obtain the NP and PT constituents. RESULTS: Extraction yields ranged from 12 to 23%. Yields of NP fractions (70-81%) were much higher than those of PT fractions (1-11%), suggesting that the former are the major tea components. Ranking of antioxidant properties of extracts was green tea>black tea>herbal tea. For all six teas, antioxidant properties of PT fractions were significantly higher than extracts and NP fractions. Extracts and fractions of all six teas showed no activity against the three Gram-negative bacteria. Green teas inhibited all three Gram-positive bacteria with S. aureus being the least susceptible. Black and herbal teas inhibited the growth of M. luteus and B. cereus, but not S. aureus. The most potent were the PT fractions of Boh Cameron Highlands and Ho Yan Hor with MID of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/disc against M. luteus. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that NP constituents are major contributors to the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of teas of C. sinensis. Although PT constituents have stronger antioxidant and antibacterial properties, they constitute only a minor component of the teas.
TI  - Naturally occurring medicinal mushroom-derived antimicrobials: a case-study using Lingzhi or Reishi Ganoderma lucidum (W. Curt.:Fr.) P. Karst. (higher Basidiomycetes).
AB  - Antibacterial activity of Lingzhi or Reishi medicinal mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum, collected from Central India was evaluated against four bacterial pathogens. Ethyl alcohol and water extracts of fruit body powder were tested using the disc diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was noted that the aqueous extract inhibited growth of pathogenic bacteria. The combined effect of fruit body extract with synthetic antibiotic discs was found to increase the activity significantly more than the antibiotics alone. The present study is an attempt to assess antibacterial activity of extracts of G. lucidum singly and in combination. The combination of G. lucidum with commercial antibiotics proves that it enhances antibacterial activity.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of some thiazolidinones as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A novel series of thiazolidinone derivatives namely 4-(4-dimethylamino-6-{4-[5-(4-ethylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-oxo-2-phenylthiazolidi n-3-yl]-phenylamino}-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yloxy)-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-one have been synthesized from the key intermediate 4-[4-(4-aminophenylamino)-6-dimethylamino-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yloxy]-1-methyl-1H-qui nolin-2-one (7). Condensation reaction of compound 7 with different aldehyde derivatives were performed to obtain Schiff base derivatives, which after cyclization gave thiazolidinones and finally they were reacted with N-ethylpiperazine to get target compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri) and four fungal strains (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus).
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Removal of high concentrations of NH(3) by a combined photoreactor and biotrickling filter system.
AB  - Average emission levels as high as 800 ppm(v) NH(3) have often been found during  the anaerobic fermentation process. At these levels, NH(3) is regarded as an environmental toxic compound. High concentrations of NH(3) gas are difficult to treat in a single treatment process, suggesting that, in terms of economic cost and treatment performance, a coupled system may be a feasible technological alternative. In the coupled TiO(2) photocatalytic-biological treatment system evaluated here, the optimal gas retention time for NH(3) removal--in terms of removal efficiency and capital cost--was 26 s. High gas temperatures, high NH(3) concentrations, and low oxygen contents were unfavorable conditions for NH(3) removal by the photoreactor. The coupled system successfully removed concentrated NH(3) gas (R % > 97 %) under disrupted and shutdown conditions. The photoreactor component of the system successfully fulfilled its role as a pretreatment process and enhanced the performance of the biotrickling filter at a high inlet NH(3) load (2,277 g-N m(-3) day(-1)). Potential ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas sp., were isolated under the high inlet NH(3) load condition. These microbial strains have a potential as biological agents in the removal of high concentrations of NH(3) in waste gas or wastewater.
TI  - Chemical, antioxidant and antimicrobial investigations of Pinus cembra L. bark and needles.
AB  - The chemical constituents and biological activity of Pinus cembra L. (Pinaceae),  native to the Central European Alps and the Carpathian Mountains, are not well known. The aim of the present work was to examine the phenolic content, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of hydromethanolic extracts of Pinus cembra L. bark and needles. Bark extract had higher concentrations of total phenolics (299.3 vs. 78.22 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract), flavonoids (125.3 vs. 19.84 mg catechin equivalents/g extract) and proanthocyanidins (74.3 vs. 12.7 mg cyanidin equivalents/g extract) than needle extract and was more active as a free radical scavenger, reducing agent and antimicrobial agent. The EC(5)(0) values in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and reducing power assays were 71.1, 6.3 and 26 mg/mL for bark extract and 186.1, 24 and 104 mg/mL for needle extract, respectively. In addition, needle extract showed ferrous ions chelating effects (EC(5)(0) = 1,755 mug/mL). The antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were assessed by the agar diffusion method. Both extracts (4 mg/well) were active against all the microorganisms tested; bark extract showed higher inhibition on all strains. These results indicate that Pinus cembra L. bark and needles are good sources of phytochemicals with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, and phytochemical screening of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. leaf extract (Apocynaceae).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, cytotoxic,  and phytochemical properties of ethanol extracts of leaves of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. (V. globosa). METHODS: The extracts were tested against bacteria and fungus through disc diffusion assay; against protozoa through growth curve determination, antiprotozoal and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The extract revealed antibacterial activities, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Antifungal assay showed that it inhibited Candida albicans. The antiprotozoal assay against Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica showed that V. globosa can inhibit the parasites, wherein the action can be comparable to metronidazole. With the in situ cell death detection kit, Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica exposed to V. globosa leaf extract was observed to fluoresce simultaneously in red and yellow signals signifying apoptotic-like changes. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the chemical composition of plant extract containing alkaloids, saponins, 2-deoxysugars, and hydrolysable tannins. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this study provides scientific evidence on the traditional use of V. globosa leaf extract in treating microbial diseases. Further, the leaf extract can possibly be used to produce alternative forms of antimicrobials.
TI  - Defense role of the cocoon in the silk worm Bombyx mori L.
AB  - Silk from the domesticated silk worm Bombyx mori procures foreign body response naturally, so it has been utilized as a biomaterial for decades. In India the prime focus of the sericulture industry is to improve silk production with high quality silk. Naturally, the silk worm builds its cocoon not only with silk proteins, but also with antimicrobial proteins to avoid infection since the cocoon is non-motile and non-feeding. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the antimicrobial proteins that persist in the cocoon of the silk worm Bombyx mori. At the pupal stage, the silk worm cocoon shell extract was prepared from the day of pupation (P0) to the day of natural rupture of the cocoon for the eclosion of moth (NR). Using the cocoon shell extract a microbial susceptibility test was performed by the disc diffusion method against the microbes Escherchia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The development of a zone of inhibition against the microbes confirmed the presence of antimicrobial/immunogenic activity of the cocoon shell extract. For further analysis, the cocoon shell extract was subjected to 7-15% sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein profile of the cocoon extract revealed the coomassie blue stained bands resolved from the 150-15 kDa molecular range. Interestingly, a polypeptide localized at around 29 kDa showed remarkable expressional changes during the development of pupa. To characterize the 29 kDa protein, it was eluted from the gel, digested with trypsin and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The trypsin-digested peptide peaks were analyzed through MASCOT and peptides were matched with the NCBI nr database. The peptides were very well matched with the 18 wheeler protein, which is reported to be responsible for innate immunity, belonging to the Toll family in insects and responsible for cellular mediated immunity.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation using silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles as functional antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The ability for silver nanoparticles to function as an antibacterial agent while  being separable from the target fluids is important for bacterial inactivation in biological fluids. This report describes the analysis of the antimicrobial activities of silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles synthesized by wet chemical methods. The bacterial inactivation of several types of bacteria was analyzed, including Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus ) and Gram-negative bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterobacter cloacae , and Escherichia coli ). The results have demonstrated the viability of the silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles for achieving effective bacterial inactivation efficiency comparable to and better than that of silver nanoparticles conventionally used. The bacteria inactivation efficiency of our silver-coated MnZn ferrite (MZF@Ag) nanoparticles was also determined for blood platelets samples, demonstrating the potential of utilization in inactivating bacterial growth in platelets prior to transfusion to ensure blood product safety, which also has important implications for enabling the capability of effective separation, delivery, and targeting of the antibacterial agents.
TI  - Biodegradation potential of oily sludge by pure and mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  - The biodegradation capacity of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons of petrochemical oily sludge in liquid medium by a bacterial consortium and five pure bacterial cultures was analyzed. Three bacteria isolated from petrochemical oily sludge, identified as Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus cibi, and two bacteria isolated from a soil contaminated by petrochemical waste, identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus demonstrated efficiency in oily sludge degradation when cultivated during 40 days. The bacterial consortium demonstrated an excellent oily sludge degradation capacity, reducing 90.7% of the aliphatic fraction and 51.8% of the aromatic fraction, as well as biosurfactant production capacity, achieving 39.4% reduction of surface tension of the culture medium and an emulsifying activity of 55.1%. The results indicated that the bacterial consortium has potential to be applied in bioremediation of petrochemical oily sludge contaminated environments, favoring the reduction of environmental passives and increasing industrial productivity.
TI  - Effect of povidone-iodine concentration and exposure time on bacteria isolated from endophthalmitis cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the in vitro susceptibility of post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis bacterial isolates to different concentrations of povidone-iodine at different exposure times. SETTING: Poostchi Ophthalmology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Ocular-fluid samples obtained from patients diagnosed with postoperative endophthalmitis were submitted to a microbiology laboratory for culture. One milliliter of microbial isolate suspension with a McFarland standard turbidity of 0.5 was mixed with 1 mL of 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% povidone-iodine solutions. After 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes of exposure at 37 degrees C, each solution was transferred to appropriate culture media and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. RESULTS: Organisms were isolated in 30 (68%) of the 44 patients evaluated. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was identified in 14 cases (47%), Streptococcus species in 8 cases (27%), Staphylococcus aureus in 5 cases (17%), Bacillus cereus in 2 cases (6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 case (3%). Higher povidone-iodine concentrations and longer exposure times were more effective than lower povidone-iodine concentrations or shorter exposure in preventing growth of bacterial isolates. The most effective regimens were 5% povidone-iodine for 15 minutes and 10% povidone-iodine for at least 5 minutes. With a high bacterial load, 13% of bacterial isolates remain viable after exposure to 10% povidone-iodine, even with a long exposure time. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that using 5% povidone-iodine for 15 minutes or 10% povidone-iodine for 5 minutes can prevent the growth of most post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis bacterial isolates.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of various leaf extracts of Merremia emarginata.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity and phytochemical screening  of the aqueous, methanol and petroleum ether leaf extracts of Merremia emarginata (M. emarginata). METHODS: The antibacterial activity of leaf extracts of M. emarginata were evaluated by agar well diffusion method against four selected bacterial species. RESULTS: The presence of tannins, flavonoids, amino acids, starch, glycosides and carbohydrates in the different leaf extracts was established. The methanol extract was more effective against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli, whereas aqueous extract was more effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: : The results in the present study suggest that M. emarginata leaf can be used in treating diseases caused by the tested organisms.
TI  - Fluorinated s-triazinyl piperazines as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of 1,3,5-triazine derivatives that contain 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and different piperazines as substituents at the carbon atoms of the triazine ring have been synthesized by a simple and efficient synthetic protocol. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated with the aid of IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was tested against seven bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, Bacillus cereus MTCC 619, Escherichia coli MTCC 739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 109, Salmonella typhi MTCC 733, Proteus vulgaris MTCC 1771) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger MTCC 282, Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 343, Aspergillus clavatus MTCC 1323, Candida albicans MTCC 183). The results indicate that some of the novel s-triazines have noteworthy activity in minimum inhibitory concentration as well as agar diffusion tests.
TI  - Efficacy of intravascular catheter lock solutions containing preservatives in the prevention of microbial colonization.
AB  - There is little published evidence regarding whether heparin lock solutions containing preservatives prevent catheter-related infections. However, adverse effects from preservative-containing flushes have been documented in neonates, leading many hospitals to avoid their use altogether. Infection control records from 1982 to 2008 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) were reviewed regarding the incidence of catheter-related infections and the use of preservative-containing intravenous locks. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of heparin lock solution containing the preservatives parabens (0.165%) or benzyl alcohol (0.9%), and 70% ethanol were examined against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, and compared with preservative-free saline with and without heparin. Growth was assessed after exposure to test solutions for 0, 2, 4 and 24h at 35 degrees C. The activities of preservatives were assessed against both planktonic (free-floating) and sessile (biofilm-embedded) micro-organisms using the MBEC Assay. Infection control records revealed two periods of increased catheter-related infections, corresponding with two intervals when preservative-free heparin was used at SJCRH. Heparin solution containing preservatives demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile forms of all six microbial species. Ethanol demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial activity, especially following short incubation periods. Heparin lock solutions containing the preservatives parabens or benzyl alcohol, and 70% ethanol demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile micro-organisms commonly responsible for catheter-related infections. These findings, together with the authors' historical infection control experience, support the use of preservatives in intravenous lock solutions to reduce catheter related infections in patients beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of hydrogen peroxide and its activation by a novel heterogeneous Fenton's-like modified PAN catalyst.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potential activation of hydrogen peroxide by a novel catalyst, reducing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide required and the time taken for microbial inactivation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial properties of an iron-based novel heterogeneous polyacrylonitrile catalyst in combination with hydrogen peroxide were examined against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus using a modified version of the European suspension test. Antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis endospores was also investigated. Bactericidal activity was significantly increased when the polyacrylonitrile catalyst was combined with hydrogen peroxide. 0.2, 0.5 and 1% w/v hydrogen peroxide resulted in average log reductions of 4.76, 5.59 and 5.37 for E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus, respectively, after 60 min exposure at room temperature. The catalyst also significantly increased the activity of hydrogen peroxide against B. subtilis and B. cereus endospores. CONCLUSIONS: These studies have demonstrated the potential biocidal use of the novel polyacrylonitrile catalyst when combined with hydrogen peroxide. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first publication to demonstrate the enhanced activity gained using the novel heterogeneous catalyst to potentiate the activity of hydrogen peroxide as a biocide.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from aerial parts of Seseli globiferum Vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with Clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and three fungal species: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 11730), Trichoderma viride (IAM 5061) and Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 36839). The essential oil showed activity against bacteria P. aeruginosa, followed by M flavus, L. monocytigenes and E. coli, and all investigated fungal species.
TI  - The potential for reductive mobilization of arsenic [As(V) to As(III)] by OSBH(2) (Pseudomonas stutzeri) and OSBH(5) (Bacillus cereus) in an oil-contaminated site.
AB  - Microbial reduction of arsenate [As(V)] plays an important role in arsenic (As) mobilization in aqueous environments. In this study, we investigated reduction of arsenate by different bacterial isolates such as OSBH(1) (GU329913), OSBH(2) (GU329914), OSBH(3) (GU329915), OSBH(4) (GU329916) and OSBH(5) (GU329917), isolated from the oil sludge of a sewage treatment plant operated by the China Petroleum Refinery Company in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan. Bacterial strains of pure culture were identified by 16S rRNA analysis (>/=99 % nucleotide similarity). Morphological and 16S rRNA analysis show that the isolate OSBH(1) is similar to E. coli, OSBH(2) is similar to P. stutzeri, OSBH(3) is similar to P. putida, OSBH(4) is similar to P. aeruginosa, and OSBH(5) is similar to B. Cereus. The As(V) was transformed to As(III) in the presence of isolates OSBH(2) and OSBH(5) by a detoxification process. The potential reduction rates of As(V) were higher in the presence of isolate OSBH(5) compared to the isolate OSBH(2). The microbial growth (cell/mL) of isolate OSBH(5) was significantly higher in culture medium compared to OSBH(2). The bacterial isolates such as OSBH(1), OSBH(3) and OSBH(4) were found to be incapable of transforming the As(V). It is concluded that the activity of the oil-degrading bacterial isolates described in this work contributes to the mobilization of As in the more toxic As(III) form that affects biotic life.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different degree of hydrolysis of palm kernel expeller  peptides against spore-forming and non-spore-forming bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to determine inhibitory effect of palm kernel expeller (PKE) peptides of different degree of hydrolysis (DH %) against spore-forming bacteria Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Clostridium perfringens; and non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli, Lisinibacillus sphaericus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A range of DH % (50-100) of PKE peptides was prepared using alcalase, and hydrolysis conditions were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). The influence of pH (6.5-10.5), temperature (35-65 degrees C), enzyme/substrate ratio (1-5%) and substrate concentration (1-2%) were studied on the response of the DH. The antibacterial activity of different DH % of PKE peptides was tested by using disc diffusion assay and micro-broth dilution assay. According to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test on each of the PKE peptides of different DH %, the 70 DH % PKE peptide showed greater inhibitory effect compared to the 100 DH % PKE peptide against B. cereus, B. coagulans, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. stearothermophillus, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Cl. perfringens, Lisinibacillus sphaericus and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The 70 DH % PKE peptides exhibited greatest overall antibacterial effect of the various peptides of PKE evaluated. Further research is needed to determine the mode of action of PKE peptides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Palm kernel expeller peptides, a natural plant product, effectively inhibited the growth of spore-forming and non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. Potentially, PKE peptides could be used in food preservation and developed as antibacterial agent in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - Exponential ATP amplification through simultaneous regeneration from AMP and pyrophosphate for luminescence detection of bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria monitoring is essential for many industrial manufacturing processes, particularly those involving in food, biopharmaceuticals, and semiconductor production. Firefly luciferase ATP luminescence assay is a rapid and simple bacteria detection method. However, the detection limit of this assay for Escherichia coli is approximately 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU), which is insufficient for many applications. This study aims to improve the assay sensitivity by simultaneous conversion of PP(i) and AMP, two products of the luciferase reaction, back to ATP to form two chain-reaction loops. Because each consumed ATP continuously produces two new ATP molecules, this approach can achieve exponential amplification of ATP. Two consecutive enzyme reactions were employed to regenerate AMP into ATP: adenylate kinase converting AMP into ADP using UTP as the energy source, and acetate kinase catalyzing acetyl phosphate and ADP into ATP. The PP(i)-recycling loop was completed using ATP sulfurylase and adenosine 5' phosphosulfate. The modification maintains good quantification linearity in the ATP luminescence assay and greatly increases its bacteria detection sensitivity. This improved method can detect bacteria concentrations of fewer than 10 CFU. This exponential ATP amplification assay will benefit bacteria monitoring in public health and manufacturing processes that require high-quality water.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of mangrove plant (Lumnitzera littorea).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activities of n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of the leaves of Lumnitzera littorea (L. littorea) against six human pathogenic microbes. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using disc diffusion and microdilution methods. RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities of the crude extracts were increased with increasing the concentration. It is clear that n-hexane extract was the most effective extract. Additionally, Gram positive Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) appear to be the most sensitive strain while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and the yeast strains (Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans)) appear to be resistance to the tested concentrations since no inhibition zone was observed. The inhibition of microbial growth at concentration as low as 0.04 mg/mL indicated the potent antimicrobial activity of L. littorea extracts. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results are considered sufficient for further study to isolate the compounds responsible for the activity and suggesting the possibility of finding potent antibacterial agents from L. littorea extracts.
TI  - Synthesis and studies of novel 2-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl amino)-4-(quinoline-4-yloxy)-6-(piperazinyl/piperidinyl)-s-triazines as potential antimicrobial, antimycobacterial and anticancer agents.
AB  - A series of novel s-triazine analogs were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (19)F NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Preliminary screening of target compounds against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneria), four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv indicated that 5d, 5h, 5n, 5p, 5q, 5r, 5s, 5t and 5u were the most active compounds among twenty one studied. Thus, they were further subjected to in vitro biological evaluation against human prostate cancer cell line (DU-145) and the results indicate that two compounds 5n and 5s were markedly active.
TI  - Effects of photoactivated titanium dioxide nanopowders and coating on planktonic  and biofilm growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - We exploited the ability of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) as an agent  for the biofilm control. Two photocatalytic systems were investigated: a 3 g L(-1) suspension of TiO(2) nanopowder in demineralized water and glass slides coated with a TiO(2) thin film, achieved by sol-gel deposition. A running protocol for the photoactivation of TiO(2) was set up using the dye rhodamine B. The microorganisms studied were Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a Bacillus cereus-group as planktonic cells. P. aeruginosa biofilms were also studied at both the solid-liquid and the solid-air interface. The TiO(2) nanopowder produced 1-log reduction of Bacillus sp. planktonic cells in 24 h, 2-log reduction of P. stutzeri planktonic cells in 30 min and 1-log reduction of P. aeruginosa planktonic cells in 2 h compared with non-photo-activated TiO(2). TiO(2) thin film produced almost a complete eradication of P. aeruginosa planktonic cells (initial concentration 10(8) cells mL(-1)) in 24 h compared to a 3-log reduction caused by UV-A light alone. In contrast, neither the photocatalytic treatment with TiO(2) film nor that with TiO(2) nanopowder had any effect on P. aeruginosa biofilms at all the interfaces investigated. Possible explanations for these findings, and for the discrepancy between this work and literature data, are discussed.
TI  - Antioxidative and antibacterial effects of seeds and fruit rind of nutraceutical  plants belonging to the Fabaceae family.
AB  - In the present study, the seeds and fruit rind of six plants of the Fabaceae family were selected to evaluate their potential as antioxidant and antibacterial agents. The dried powders were individually extracted with various organic solvents by the cold percolation method, were evaluated for antibacterial activity and methanol extracts used for antioxidant activities. Total phenol, protein and sugar contents were also measured. Antioxidant activities were measured by DPPH free radical scavenging activity, superoxide anion radical scavenging activity and reducing capacity assessment. Antibacterial activity was measured by the agar well diffusion method against four Gram positive and four Gram negative bacteria. The methanol extract of the fruit rind of C. indica showed the maximum DPPH free radical scavenging activity, superoxide anion radical scavenging activity, a high reducing capacity assessment and also had the highest total phenol content. There was a direct correlation between the phenol content and the antioxidant activity. The antibacterial activity of all the extracts was more pronounced on Gram positive bacteria than on Gram negative bacteria. Thus, the fruit rind of C. indica showed the best antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
TI  - Evaluation of four microbial Class II fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase enzymes  for use as biocatalysts.
AB  - Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase has been used as biocatalyst in the synthesis of several pharmaceutical compounds such as monosaccharides and analogs. Is has been suggested that microbial metal-dependant Class II aldolases could be better industrial catalysts than mammalian Class I enzyme because of their greater stability. The Class II aldolases from four microbes were subcloned into the Escherichia coli vector pT7-7, expressed and purified to near homogeneity. The kinetic parameters, temperature stability, pH profile, and tolerance to organic solvents of the Class II enzymes were determined, and compared with the properties of the Class I aldolase from rabbit muscle. Contrary to results obtained previously with the E. coli Class II aldolase, which was reported to be more stable than the mammalian enzyme, other recombinant Class II aldolases were found to be generally less stable than the Class I enzyme, especially in the presence of organic solvents. Class II aldolase from Bacillus cereus showed higher temperature stability than the other enzymes tested, but only the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Class II aldolase had a stability comparable to the Class I mammalian enzyme under assay conditions. The turnover number of the recombinant M. tuberculosis and Magnaporthe grisea Class II type A aldolases was comparable or higher than that of the Class I enzyme. The recombinant B. cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Class II type B aldolases had very low turnover numbers and low metal content, indicating that the E. coli overexpression system may not be suitable for the Class II type B aldolases from these microorganisms.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - MukBEF on the march: taking over chromosome organization in bacteria?
AB  - Smc-ScpAB complexes, also called bacterial condensin, are comprised of highly conserved proteins present in a wide variety of bacteria and archaea. They facilitate bacterial chromosome segregation probably by organizing and/or compacting nascent sister chromosomes. In some gamma-proteobacteria however the Smc-ScpAB complex appears to have been replaced by a different SMC complex, called MukBEF. Petrushenko et al., (2011) now show in this issue of Molecular Microbiology that distantly related homologues of MukBEF, called MksBEF, can be found in the genomes of many more species of bacteria (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus) that seem to be scattered over the phylogenetic tree. The newly identified MksBEF proteins are organized in operons like MukBEF and occur in combination with Smc-ScpAB and/or MukBEF. Mutations in mksBEF in P. aeruginosa result in the formation of anucleate cells whereas its mild overexpression can suppress the accumulation of anucleate cells in smc null mutants. These findings suggest that MksBEF and Smc-ScpAB share their duties in chromosome partitioning in P. aeruginosa and possibly in other bacteria too. Thus, chromosome organization and segregation in bacteria appear to be governed by up to three distinct condensin complexes, indicating that this process could be much more sophisticated than previously appreciated.
TI  - A new class of 2-(4-cyanophenyl amino)-4-(6-bromo-4-quinolinyloxy)-6-piperazinyl  (piperidinyl)-1,3,5-triazine analogues with antimicrobial/antimycobacterial activity.
AB  - This study presents the synthesis and in vitro pharmacological evaluations of novel 2-(4-cyanophenyl amino)-4-(6-bromo-4-quinolinyloxy)-6-piperazinyl (piperidinyl)-1,3,5-triazines. The title compounds were assayed for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneria) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) using paper disc diffusion and agar streak dilution method as well as against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain using BACTEC MGIT and Lowenstein-Jensen MIC method. The bioassay results indicate that nine compounds namely 5d, 5h, 5n, 5p, 5q, 5r, 5s, 5t and 5u could be considered as possible potential agents with dual antimicrobial and antimycobacterial activities. The structures of the compounds were elucidated with the aid of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (19)F NMR spectroscopy and CHN analysis.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Preparation of mucoadhesive oral patches containing tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol for treatment of local mouth bacterial infections and candidiasis.
AB  - The specific aim of this work was to prepare mucoadhesive patches containing tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol in an attempt to develop a novel oral drug delivery system for the treatment of mouth infections. The bilayered patches were prepared using ethyl cellulose as a backing layer and carbopol 934 as a matrix mucoadhesive layer. Patches were prepared with different loading amounts of tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol. The antimicrobial activity was assessed for the prepared patches using the disc-diffusion method against the yeast Candida albicans and five bacterial strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus bronchispti. In this work, we highlighted the possibility of occurrence of a synergistic action between carvacrol and tetracycline. The best formulation was selected based on microbiological tests, drug release, ex-vivo mucoadhesive performance, and swelling index. Physical characteristics of the selected formulations were determined. These included pH, patch thickness, weight uniformity, content uniformity, folding endurance, and patch stability.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity of 3-butenyl, 4-pentenyl, 2-phenylethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanate in Brassica vegetables.
AB  - This study investigated antibacterial activities of 4 isothiocyanates (3-butenyl, 4-phentenyl, 2-phenylethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanate) against 4 Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) and 7 Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleaesuis, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) by an agar disc diffusion assay. Benzyl isothiocyanate (> 90.00 mm inhibition zone diameter at 0.1 muL/mL) and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (58.33 mm at 0.2 muL/mL) showed large inhibition zones especially against B. cereus. Also, 3-butenyl isothiocyanate (21.67 mm at 1.0 muL/mL) and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate (19.67 mm at 1.0 muL/mL) displayed potent antibacterial activity against A. hydrophila. Benzyl and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate indicated higher activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria than 3-butenyl and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate, and were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial activity and quantum-chemical studies of novel 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues.
AB  - A new series of 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole derivatives (2a-k) was designed and synthesized through a rapid, simple, and efficient methodology in excellent isolated yield. These compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activities against eight bacteria, e.g. Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, and three fungi e.g. Aspergillus oryzae, Candida albicans, and Saccharomyces cerevis. The results indicate that some of the compounds exhibit strong antibacterial activity, depending on the bacterial strain, but show virtually no antifungal activity. The structure-antibacterial activity relationships were studied using some physicochemical and quantum-chemical parameters with the ab initio Hartree-Fock model at the RHF/6-31G level of theory. A good qualitative correlation between predicted lipophilic parameters and antibacterial activity has been found.
TI  - The role of two families of bacterial enzymes in putrescine synthesis from agmatine via agmatine deiminase.
AB  - Putrescine, one of the main biogenic amines associated to microbial food spoilage, can be formed by bacteria from arginine via ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), or from agmatine via agmatine deiminase (AgDI). This study aims to correlate putrescine production from agmatine to the pathway involving N-carbamoylputrescine formation via AdDI (the aguA product) and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (the aguB product), or putrescine carbamoyltransferase (the ptcA product) in bacteria. PCR methods were developed to detect the two genes involved in putrescine production from agmatine. Putrescine production from agmatine could be linked to the aguA and ptcA genes in Lactobacillus hilgardii X1B, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 11700, and Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579. By contrast Lactobacillus sakei 23K was unable to produce putrescine, and although a fragment of DNA corresponding to the gene aguA was amplified, no amplification was observed for the ptcA gene. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 produces putrescine and is reported to harbour aguA and aguB genes, responsible for agmatine deiminase and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activities. The enzyme from P. aeruginosa PAO1 that converts N-carbamoylputrescine to putrescine (the aguB product) is different from other microorganisms studied (the ptcA product). Therefore, the aguB gene from P. aeruginosa PAO1 could not be amplified with ptcA-specific primers. The aguB and ptcA genes have frequently been erroneously annotated in the past, as in fact these two enzymes are neither homologous nor analogous. Furthermore, the aguA, aguB and ptcA sequences available from GenBank were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, revealing that gram-positive bacteria harboured ptcA, whereas gram-negative bacteria harbour aguB. This paper also discusses the role of the agmatine deiminase system (AgDS) in acid stress resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the efficacy of 4 denture cleanser tabs against oral bacteria.
AB  
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activity of 4-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide; a novel bioactive compound from Moringa oleifera seed extract.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of crude seed extract of Moringa oleifera was investigated by thin layer chromatography bioassay against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, and Penicillium sclerotigenum; most of them were prominently inhibited by an isolate with R(F) 0.92-0.96. Characterization and identification of the extract revealed the occurrence of three bioactive compounds: 4-(alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate, methyl N-4-(alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy) benzyl carbamate (both known compounds), and 4-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide, existence of which in any Moringa spp. or plant is reported for the first time. The UV spectrum of the novel compound showed maximum absorption at 273 and 225 nm in MeOH while the IR spectrum revealed several characteristic bands at 3100, 2900, 1700, 1500, 1300, 1100 and 1000 cm(-1). The (1)H-NMR showed signals at 1.2 and 3.77 ppm and the (13)C-NMR presented signals at 155, 122, 91.7 and 98.4 ppm. All the compounds at 5 mg/L had very high bactericidal activity against some of test pathogens even at contact period 1-2 h. 4-(beta-D-Glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl thiocarboxamide was the most potent, with 99.2 % inhibition toward Shigella dysenteriae and 100 % toward Bacillus cereus, E. coli and Salmonella typhi within 4 h of contact.
TI  - Chemical composition, olfactory evaluation and antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and absolutes from Morocco.
AB  - The chemical compositions of selected essential oils from North Africa, especially Morocco, of geranium, wild Moroccan chamomile and rosemary as well as absolutes of rose and geranium were determined using GC/FID and GC/MS. These oils and absolutes were tested concerning their antimicrobial activity against some food spoilage strains obtained from fresh milk and minced meat products, like sausages and pork fillet, in accordance with ISO testing procedures. Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains were used, as well as the yeast Candida albicans. Using a serial broth dilution method, all samples demonstrated weak antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast, compared with the activity towards the Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antioxidant, cytoprotective and antibacterial effects of Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) leaves.
AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the antioxidant, cytoprotective  and antibacterial effects of aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Sea buckthorn) (SBT) leaves by using various in vitro systems and analysis of marker compounds by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The chemical composition of the leaf extracts was quantified by colorimetric reaction in terms of total phenol and flavonoids contents. Further, some of its bioactive phenolic constituents, such as quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol and isorhamnetin were also quantified in both SBT leaf extracts by RP-HPLC. The SBT leaf extracts exhibited potent antioxidant activity determined by 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Further, both extracts were observed to have cytoprotective activity against hydrogen peroxide and hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase induced damage to BHK-21 cell line. The SBT leaf extracts showed growth inhibiting effect against Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. These observations suggest that aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of Sea buckthorn leaves have marked antioxidant, cytoprotective and antibacterial activities.
TI  - Use of Tetra-ammonium Tetrakis(4-Sulphonato)Phenyl Porphyrin for Pseudomonas and  Bacillus Cell Imaging.
AB  - The use of tetraammonium tetrakis(4-sulphonato)phenyl porphyrin (TPPS), a water-soluble anionic compound, as a stain to analyse bacterial cells using fluorescent microscopy was investigated. TPPS was effectively used to analyse two different bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. The variation in brightness with varying concentrations of TPPS was studied. The patterns of variations for these bacteria were found to be the same, but with consistently higher brightness for Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
AB  - Transition metal complexes of the type [M(L)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [M(L)(2)(PPh(3))] {M=Ni, Co, Cu and Zn; L=cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate; PPh(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. The complexes were characterized using IR, UV-vis, NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (TGA). The (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and (31)P NMR showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. The spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. Thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. The ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. Furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus. The metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. Generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with Zn(L)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/mL; and Ni(L)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/mL under laboratory conditions.
TI  - Post-antibacterial effect of thymol.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of thymol has been well established and reported in the scientific literature. Continued suppression of bacterial growth following limited exposure to antimicrobial compounds at different concentrations greater than or equal to the minimum inhibitory concentration level (MIC) and at concentrations less than the MIC can be used as an indicator of biological activity, and are respectively referred to as a post-antibacterial effect (PAE) and a post-antibiotic sub-MIC effect (PA-SME). In this study, the PAE and the PA-SME of thymol against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus were investigated. A spectrophotometric method was used to determine the PAE and the PA-SME of thymol against the selected test strains. Thymol exhibited a considerable PAE and PA-SME at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations against test strains. The greatest duration of both the PAE and the PA-SME was observed for thymol against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The PAE and PA-SME times for E. coli were 12 and 8 h, respectively, and for P. aeruginosa were 11 and 7.5 h, respectively. The duration of the PAE and PA-SME observed for S. aureus and B. cereus was shorter than for Gram-negative strains.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - An independent in vitro comparison of povidone iodine and SteriLid.
AB  - AIM: Povidone iodine (PI) and SteriLid (SL) are biocides used to decrease bacterial load on the eyelid margin. We compared the antibacterial activity of PI and SL to determine the better antiseptic. METHODS: Time-kill studies of PI and SL against a battery of bacteria that included Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis were conducted at time points 1, 2, 10, and 30 min. The comparative outcome measures were based on 90% and 99.9% decreases in bacterial colony counts. RESULTS: PI was more effective at a 90% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (8/9 vs. 7/9), 2 min (9/9 vs. 6/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 8/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 8/9). PI was more effective at a 99.9% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (5/9 vs. 3/9), 2 min (7/9 vs. 4/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 4/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 6/9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports PI as an effective antiseptic for decreasing the bacterial load that can exist on the eyelid margin. SL appears to be a less effective alternative.
TI  - Novel family of antimicrobial peptides from the skin of Rana shuchinae.
AB  - So far numerous antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from amphibians. In this work, a new family of antimicrobial peptides, named shuchin, was purified and characterized from skin secretions of the frog, Rana shuchinae that lives in freezing mountains. Totally two members of shuchin (shuchin 1 and 2) were identified with the amino acid sequence of NALSMPRNKCNRALMCFG and NALSSPRNKCDRASSCFG, respectively. cDNAs encoding shuchins were cloned from the skin cDNA library of R. shuchinae. The precursors of shuchin are composed of 62 amino acid residues including the conserved signal peptides, acidic propieces, and mature antimicrobial peptides. Synthetic shuchins showed strong and broad antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus; MICs<12.5 microg/ml), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; most MICs from 3.1 to 12.5 microg/ml), and yeast (Candida albicans; MICs of 6.25 microg/ml), but no hemolytic activity under the effective concentration, thereby provide more leading templates for designing novel anti-infection agents.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of schiff bases of 4-(2-aminophenyl)-morpholines.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of 4-(2-aminophenyl)morpholines were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were screened for analgesic (100 and 200 mg/kg), antiinflammatory (200 and 400 mg/kg), antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. N-benzylidine-2-morpholoino benzenamine (1) and N-(3-nitro benzylidine)-2-morpholino benzenamine (3) exhibited significant analgesic, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Novel 6,8-dibromo-4(3H)quinazolinone derivatives of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities.
AB  - Starting from 4-(6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl-4-oxo-(4H)-quinazolin-3-yl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (II) and its acid hydrazide III, a new series of Schiff bases IV and their cyclized products, thiazolidinones V, oxadiazole VIII, pyrazoles X-XII, pyrroles XIII-XV and other related products were synthesized. These compounds were screened for their anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) and anti-fungal activity (Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus) using paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 2-(4-(2-phenyl-6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-(4H)quinazolin-3-yl)-N-ethylamido benzoic acid hydrazide VIIa was found to exhibits the most potent in vitro anti-microbial activity with the MICs of 1.56, 3.125, 1.56, 25, 25 and 25 microg/ml against E. coli, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and B. cereus respectively. Compound 2-(4-(2-phenyl-6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-(4H)quinazolin-3-yl)-N-methyl thioamido benzoic acid hydrazide VIIc was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro anti-fungal activity with MICs 0.78 and 0.097 microg/ml against C. albicans and A. flavus.
TI  - An assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using Lucilia sericata Meigen as the marker species.
AB  - The relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (ES) from two carrion-feeding insects, Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and Dermestes maculatus DeGeer, and a detritivore, Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, were compared to that of Lucilia sericata Meigen, a species with ES of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. Viable counts were used to assess time-kill of ES against five bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although T. molitor and D. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of P. mirabilis. The blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The larval ES from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of potency varied between the four species. These differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. Overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using L. sericata.
TI  - Occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in waste site of Ede south west Nigeria.
AB  - Analysis of antibiotic resistant bacteria from composted waste site soil samples  for two seasons were done, using prepared diagnostic test agar and direct sensitivity tests. All major isolated bacteria were subjected to various antibiotics. Concurrent positive and negative tests were simultaneously studied. Results show relatively high resistant and sensitive bacteria in both seasons. In wet seasons, the Bacillus cereus concentrations are considerably reduced than in the dry. In the dry seasons, Bacillus cereus was sensitive to Erythromycin (ERY) and Tetracycline (TET) and slightly resistant to Ampicillin (AMP), Chloramphenicol (CHL), Cloxacillin (CXC) and water (CNT). In the wet season, identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa was moderately resistant to Streptomycin (STR) and Tetracycline and remained resistant to Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole (COT), Nitrofurantion (NIT) and water (CNT). The implications for human health are discussed.
TI  - Chemistry, antioxidant, antibacterial and antifungal activities of volatile oils  and their components.
AB  - The present paper reports the chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of several essential oils and their components. Analysis showed that three oils (Carum carvi L., Verbena officinalis L. and Majorana hortensis L.) contained predominantly oxygenated monoterpenes, while others studied (Pimpinella anisum L., Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) mainly contained anethole. C. carvi, V. officinalis and M. hortensis oils exhibited the most potent antioxidant activity, due their contents of carvacrol, anethole and estragol. Antibacterial action was assessed against a range of pathogenic and useful bacteria and fungi of agro-food interest. V. officinalis and C. carvi oils proved the most effective, in particular against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Carvacrol proved most active against Escherichia coli, and completely inhibited the growth of Penicillium citrinum. The oils proved inactive towards some Lactobacilli strains, whereas single components showed an appreciable activity. These results may be important for use of the essential oils as natural preservatives for food products.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of minerals from ores indigenous to Korea.
AB  - We tested the antibacterial properties of a mix of minerals consisting mainly of  sericite, talc, and halloysite from Korea. The preparation showed clear growth inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. These results indicate that this preparation, made from ore minerals indigenous to Korea, could be used to develop new antibacterial reagents.
TI  - Enhancing ATP-based bacteria and biofilm detection by enzymatic pyrophosphate regeneration.
AB  - The manufacturing processes of many electronic and medical products demand the use of high-quality water. Hence the water supply systems for these processes are required to be examined regularly for the presence of microorganisms and microbial biofilms. Among commonly used bacteria detection approaches, the ATP luminescence assay is a rapid, sensitive, and easy to perform method. The aim of this study is to investigate whether ATP regeneration from inorganic pyrophosphate, a product of the ATP luminescence assay, can stabilize the bioluminescence signals in ATP detection. ADPglc pyrophosphorylase (AGPPase), which catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from PP(i) in the presence of ADPglc, was selected because the system yields much lower luminescence background than the commercially available ATP sulfurylase/adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) system which was broadly used in pyrosequencing technology. The AGPPase-based assay could be used to measure both PP(i) and ATP quantitatively and shows 1.5- to 4.0-fold slight increases in a 10-min assay. The method could also be used to stabilize the luminescence signals in detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus in either broth or biofilm. These findings suggest that the AGPPase-based ATP regeneration system will find many practical applications such as detection of bacterial biofilm in water pipelines.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and B. cereus bacteria sterilization using afterglow of non-thermal plasma at atmospheric pressure.
AB  - We developed and employed a new geometrical structure of dielectric barrier discharge in atmospheric pressure for bacterial broad spectrum sterilization. We utilized a plasma source having an AC power supply at 50 HZ and 5,400 V (rms value). We prepared suspensions of the Gram-negative bacteria species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a Gram-positive of Bacillus cereus with Luria-Bertani broth media up to OD(600 nm) = 0.25 of McFarland standard. Afterglow of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma treated these suspensions. The influence of the atmospheric plasma afterglow on the species was assayed in different time durations 5, 10, and 15 min. The spectroscopic results of this investigation indicated that the survival reduction of the species can reach to 100% for P. aeruginosa in an exposure time of 10 min, E. coli and B. cereus in an exposure time of 15 min.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - Characterization of corrosive bacterial consortia isolated from petroleum-product-transporting pipelines.
AB  - Microbiologically influenced corrosion is a problem commonly encountered in facilities in the oil and gas industries. The present study describes bacterial enumeration and identification in diesel and naphtha pipelines located in the northwest and southwest region in India, using traditional cultivation technique and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences of the isolates was carried out, and the samples obtained from the diesel and naphtha-transporting pipelines showed the occurrence of 11 bacterial species namely Serratia marcescens ACE2, Bacillus subtilis AR12, Bacillus cereus ACE4, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AI1, Klebsiella oxytoca ACP, Pseudomonas stutzeri AP2, Bacillus litoralis AN1, Bacillus sp., Bacillus pumilus AR2, Bacillus carboniphilus AR3, and Bacillus megaterium AR4. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were not detected in samples from both pipelines. The dominant bacterial species identified in the petroleum pipeline samples were B. cereus and S. marcescens in the diesel and naphtha pipelines, respectively. Therefore, several types of bacteria may be involved in biocorrosion arising from natural biofilms that develop in industrial facilities. In addition, localized (pitting) corrosion of the pipeline steel in the presence of the consortia was observed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The potential role of each species in biofilm formation and steel corrosion is discussed.
TI  - In vitro effects on bacterial growth of phenoloxidase reaction products.
AB  - An active phenoloxidase preparation from the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus exhibited a strong antibacterial effect in vitro on the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae whereas a weaker but still significant effect against Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In most cases reduction of bacterial growth was stronger when dopamine was used as substrate as compared to L-dopa. The effect on bacteria was abolished if no substrate was available for the phenoloxidase or in the presence of the phenoloxidase inhibitor phenylthiourea.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the virulence of invertebrate and mammalian pathogenic bacteria in the oral insect infection model Galleria mellonella.
AB  - Infection of Galleria mellonella by feeding a mixture of Bacillus thuringiensis spores or vegetative bacteria in association with the toxin Cry1C results in high levels of larval mortality. Under these conditions the toxin or bacteria have minimal effects on the larva when inoculated separately. In order to evaluate whether G. mellonella can function as an oral infection model for human and entomo-bacterial pathogens, we tested strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a Drosophila targeting Pseudomonas entomophila strain. Six B. cereus strains (5 diarrheal, 1 environmental isolate) were first screened in 2nd instar G. mellonella larvae by free ingestion and four of them were analyzed by force-feeding 5th instar larvae. The virulence of these B. cereus strains did not differ from the B. thuringiensis virulent reference strain 407Cry(-) with the exception of strain D19 (NVH391/98) that showed a lower virulence. Following force-feeding, 5th instar G. mellonella larvae survived infection with B. anthracis, L. monocytogenes, E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa strains in contrast to the P. entomophila strain which led to high mortality even without Cry1C toxin co-ingestion. Thus, specific virulence factors adapted to the insect intestine might exist in B. thuringiensis/B. cereus and P. entomophila. This suggests a co-evolution between host and pathogens and supports the close links between B. thuringiensis and B. cereus and more distant links to their relative B. anthracis.
TI  - Expression of recombinant antibacterial lactoferricin-related peptides from Pichia pastoris expression system.
AB  - Four recombinant antimicrobial peptide (rAMP) cDNAs, constructed from two goat lactoferricin-related peptide cDNAs (GLFcin and GLFcin II) with/without (His)(6)-Tag, were cloned into pPICZalphaC and transformed into Pichia pastoris SMD1168H. After methanol induction, these rAMPs were expressed and secreted into broth. They were purified after CM-Sepharose (without His-tg), HisTrap (with His-tg) and Sephadex G-25 chromatographies. The yield of purified rAMP was 0.15 mg/mL of broth. These 4 rAMPs were thermal-stable and with high antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli BCRC 11549, Pseudomonas aeruginosa BCRC 12450, Bacillus cereus BCRC 10603, Staphylococcus aureus BCRC 25923, Propioni bacterium acnes BCRC 10723, and Listera monocytogenes BCRC 14845. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of rAMPs against these indicators ranged from 4.07 to 16.00 mg/mL.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. Several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. There is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (PLTs), and red blood cells. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored PLT concentrates (PCs). Nine synthetic AMPs, four from PLT microbicidal protein-derived peptides (PD1-4) and five Arg-Trp (RW) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and PC samples spiked with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacillus cereus. A 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. RESULTS: In both plasma alone and PCs, RW3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae; PD4 and RW2 against P. aeruginosa; and RW4 against K. pneumoniae. The activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic AMPs against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, PCs, and other blood products.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - Assessment of the medicinal potentials of the methanol extracts of the leaves and stems of Buddleja saligna.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Buddleja saligna Willd (Loganiaceae) is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree; trunk short, often gnarled and crooked; crown dense, rounded or domed-shaped; foliage greyish green. The wild olives are traditionally used to lower blood pressures in many parts of the world. In southern Africa, bark and leaf decoctions are used to treat colic, coughs, colds, sore eyes, urinary problems and as purgatives. METHODS: The antibacterial, antioxidant activities and phenolic contents of the methanol extracts of the leaves and stems of Buddleja saligna were evaluated using in vitro standard methods. Spectrophotometry was the basis for the determinations of total phenol, total flavonoids, flavonols, and proanthocyanidins. Tannins, quercetin and catechin equivalents were used for these parameters. The antioxidant activities of the leaves and stem extracts of Buddleja saligna were determined by ABTS, DPPH, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (FRAP) methods. Laboratory isolates of 10 bacteria species which included five Gram-positive and five Gram-negative strains were used to assay for antibacterial activity of this plant. RESULTS: The antioxidant activities of the leaves as determined by the ABTS and DPPH were similar to that of the stem. The flavonoids and the flavonols contents of the leaves were higher than that of the stem but the total phenols, proanthocyanidins and FRAP activities were higher in the methanol extracts of the stem. The extracts did show activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. For instance, while the methanol extract of the leaves showed good activities on all the organisms except Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at MICs of between 2.5 and 5.0 mg/ml, the extract of the stem only showed activities on Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyrogens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the same concentration. CONCLUSION: The results from this study indicate that the leaves and stem extracts of Buddleja saligna possess antioxidant properties and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger or, acting possibly as primary antioxidants. Although, the antibacterial properties of Buddleja saligna are not as effective as the standard drugs-Chloramphenicol and Streptomycin, they still possess some activity against bacterial strains used in this study. Buddleja saligna may therefore be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutical plant-based products.
TI  - Infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  - Infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (AA). There  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with AA and the patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in the infections that they incur. Prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. Recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. The most common invasive mycoses include the Aspergillus species, Zygomycetes, Candida spp., and Fusarium spp. Bacterial infections that are seen in patients with AA include gram-positive coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Enterococcus, Staphylococus aureus, Clostridium spp., Micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. Gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumonia, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio vulnificus. Viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the Herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides A, B, and C. Evidence of the parasite Strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. This review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with AA who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. The specific immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.
TI  - Screening of some Kenyan medicinal plants for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Eleven medicinal plants used by traditional healers in Machakos and Kitui District were screened, namely: Ajuga remota Benth, Aloe secundiflora Engl, Amaranthus hybridus L, Cassia didymobotrya Fes, Croton macrostachyus Del, Entada leptostachya Harms, Erythrina abyssinica DC, Harrisonia abyssinica Oliv, Schkuhria pinnata O. Ktze, Terminalia kilimandscharica Engl and Ziziphus abyssinica Hochst for potential antibacterial activity against four medically important bacterial strains, namely: Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus lutea ATCC 9341 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. The antibacterial activity of methanol extracts was determined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The plant extracts were more active against Gram-positive (G+) than Gram-negative (G-) bacteria. The positive controls were streptomycin and benzylpenicillin for G- and G+ bacteria, respectively, both had a significant MIC at <1 mg/mL. The most susceptible bacteria were B. cereus, followed by M. lutea, while the most resistant bacteria were Ps. aeruginosa, followed by E. coli. The present study supports the use of these plants by the herbalists in the management of bacterial ailments. H. abyssinica and T. kilimandscharica showed the best antibacterial activity; hence these plants can be further subjected to phytochemical and pharmacological evaluation.
TI  - Antiplasmid activity of 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate from Alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alpinia galanga (L.) Swartz is traditionally used in the treatment of various ailments across India, China, and Southeast Asian countries. In India it is a reputed drug in indigenous system of medicine and largely used as antibacterial and antiseptic. In southern India the rhizomes has been used as a domestic remedy against bacterial infections. AIM OF THE STUDY: To identify a potential antiplasmid compound from Alpinia galanga against multi-drug resistant bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude rhizome extract of Alpinia galanga was prepared in acetone. Antibacterial activity was checked by MIC and antiplasmid activity was checked by SIC. The principal compound responsible for the antiplasmid activity, in the crude extract, was identified by bioassay guided fractionation using hexane-acetone. Antibiotic resistance profile of plasmid harboring strains and plasmid cured strains was determined by disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The crude acetone extract of the rhizomes of Alpinia galanga exhibited antiplasmid activity against Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis with an efficiency of 92%, 82% and 8% respectively at 400 microg/ml SIC. The principal compound responsible for the activity was identified as 1'-acetoxychavicol acetate. 1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate demonstrated the ability to cure plasmid encoded antibiotic resistance in various multi-drug resistant bacterial strains of clinical isolates such as Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus with curing efficiency of 66%, 75%, 70%, 32% and 6% respectively at SIC of 400-800 microg/ml. CONCLUSION: 1'-Acetoxychavicol acetate mediated R-plasmid curing significantly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentration of antibiotics required to inhibit growth of bacteria, thus making the antibiotic treatment more effective.
TI  - Biodegradation of international jet A-1 aviation fuel by microorganisms isolated  from aircraft tank and joint hydrant storage systems.
AB  - Microorganisms contaminating international Jet A-1 aircraft fuel and fuel preserved in Joint Hydrant Storage Tank (JHST) were isolated, characterized and identified. The isolates were Bacillus subtillis, Bacillus megaterium, Flavobacterium oderatum, Sarcina flava, Micrococcus varians, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus brevis. Others included Candida tropicalis, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces estuari, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cladosporium resinae, Penicillium citrinum and Penicillium frequentans. The viable plate count of microorganisms in the Aircraft Tank ranged from 1.3 (+/-0.01) x 104 cfu/mL to 2.2 (+/-1.6) x 104 cfu/mL for bacteria and 102 cfu/mL to 1.68 (+/-0.32) x 103 cfu/mL for fungi. Total bacterial counts of 1.79 (+/-0.2) x 104 cfu/mL to 2.58 (+/-0.04) x 104 cfu/mL and total fungal count of 2.1 (+/-0.1) x 103 cfu/mL to 2.28 (+/-0.5) x 103 cfu/mL were obtained for JHST. Selected isolates were re-inoculated into filter sterilized aircraft fuels and biodegradation studies carried out. After 14 days incubation, Cladosporium resinae exhibited the highest degradation rate with a percentage weight loss of 66 followed by Candida albicans (60.6) while Penicillium citrinum was the least degrader with a weight loss of 41.6%. The ability of the isolates to utilize the fuel as their sole source of carbon and energy was examined and found to vary in growth profile between the isolates. The results imply that aviation fuel could be biodegraded by hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms. To avert a possible deterioration of fuel quality during storage, fuel pipe clogging and failure, engine component damage, wing tank corrosion and aircraft disaster, efficient routine monitoring of aircraft fuel systems is advocated.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the methanolic extract and compounds from Morus mesozygia stem bark.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: This study was aimed at investigating the antimicrobial activity of the methanolic extract (MMB) and compounds isolated from the stem bark of Morus mesozygia, namely 3beta-acetoxyurs-12-en-11-one (1), moracin Q (2), moracin T (3), artocarpesin (4), cycloartocarpesin (5), moracin R (6), moracin U (8), moracin C (9), and moracin M (10). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The liquid microdilution assay was used in the determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC), against nine bacterial and two fungal species. RESULTS: The results of the MIC determination showed that the compounds 3, 4, 8 and 9 were able to prevent the growth of all tested microbial species. All other samples showed selective activities. Their inhibitory effects were noted on 90.9% studied organisms for the crude extract, 81.8% for compound 6, 72.7% for compound 10, 63.6% for compound 1, 54.5% for compound 5, and 45.5% for compound 2. The lowest MIC value of 39 microg/ml was obtained with the crude extract against Escherichia coli. The corresponding value for compounds (5 microg/ml) was registered with compound 9 on Shigella dysenteriae and compound 3 on E. coli, S. dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Bacillus cereus. The lowest MIC value (39 microg/ml) observed with the crude extract (on E. coli) was only eightfold greater than that of gentamycin used as reference antibiotic (RA) while the corresponding value (5 microg/ml) recorded with compounds 3 and 9 was equal to that of RA on the corresponding microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results highlighted the interesting antimicrobial potency of M. mesozygia as well as that of the studied compounds, and provided scientific basis for the traditional use of this species.
TI  - Interventions for control of Salmonella: clearance of microbial growth from rubber picker fingers.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance of bacterial contamination. Before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. Five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and Staphylococcus intermedius. In separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. Turbidity of the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. New rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (P < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. We improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. Two of the compounds were most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with Salmonella Enteritidis. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of Salmonella Enteritidis before and after treatment. The most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared Salmonella Enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.
TI  - Synthesis, spectral characterization, in-vitro microbiological evaluation and cytotoxic activities of novel macrocyclic bis hydrazone.
AB  - A macrocyclic hydrazone Schiff base was synthesized by reacting 1,4-dicarbonyl phenyl dihydrazide with 2,6-diformyl-4-methyl phenol and a series of metal complexes with this new Schiff base were synthesized by reaction with Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) metal salts. The Schiff base and its complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, IR, (1)H NMR, UV-vis, FAB mass, ESR spectra, fluorescence, thermal, magnetic and molar conductance data. The analytical data reveal that the Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes possess 2:1 metal-ligand ratios. All the complexes are non-electrolytes in DMF and DMSO due to their low molar conductance values. Infrared spectral data suggest that the hydrazone Schiff base behaves as a hexadentate ligand with NON NON donor sequence towards the metal ions. The ESR spectral data shows that the metal-ligand bond has considerable covalent character. The electrochemical behavior of the copper(II) complex was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The Schiff base and its complexes have also been screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella dysentery, Micrococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and antifungal activities (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium and Candida albicans) by MIC method. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Copper(II) and uranyl(II) complexes with acylthiosemicarbazide: synthesis, characterization, antibacterial activity and effects on the growth of promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60.
AB  - New chelates of N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-butyl-thiosemicarbazide (X=H, Cl, Br) with Cu(2+) and UO(2)(2+) have been prepared and characterized by analytical and physico-chemical techniques such as magnetic susceptibility measurements, elemental and thermal analyses, electronic, ESR and IR spectral studies. Room temperature ESR spectra of Cu(II) complexes yield {g} values characteristic of distorted octahedral and pseudo-tetrahedral geometry. Infrared spectra indicate that complexes contain six-coordinate uranium atom with the ligand atoms arranged in an equatorial plane around the linear uranyl group. Effects of these complexes on the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60 and their antibacterial activity (against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 strains) were studied comparatively with that of free ligands.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
AB  - The crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of Dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Preliminary screening showed inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different R(f) values against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. The MIC of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. The non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the MBC of the fractions.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Isolation, structure elucidation and antibacterial activities of streptothricin acids.
AB  - Five streptothricin acids (compounds 1-5) were isolated by ion-exchange resin chromatography and preparative RP-HPLC from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis. Their structures were elucidated mainly by analyses of the IR, HR-EIS-MS and NMR spectral data. They were deduced as two known compounds, streptothricin F acid (1) and streptothricin D acid (2), and three new compounds, 12-carbamoylstreptothricin E acid (3), 12-carbamoylstreptothricin D acid (4) and N-acetyl-streptothricin D acid (5), respectively. The antibacterial activities of 1-5 against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were assayed by micro-broth dilution. Comparison of the MICs with streptothricin F and D showed that the antimicrobial activities of 1-5 were decreased significantly but varied with the structures.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some macrophytes from Lake Manzalah (Egypt).
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of aqueous and organic solvents (chloroform, ethanol and methanol) extracts of four plants Ceratophyllum demersum L., Eichhornia crassipes, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton pectinatus were tested in vitro against seventeen different microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Nine of these identified organisms were obtained from different sources, Bacillus subtilis 1020, Bacillus cereus 1080, Staphylococcus aureus, Erwinia carotovora NCPPB 312, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium italicum. The other eight organisms were isolated from Manzalah lake water and identified using API 20E strip system (BioMereux). One hundred pathogenic bacterial isolates representing eight genera were identified to species level. These organisms are Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Salmonella colerasuis (13%), Shigella sp. (11%), Serratia liquefaciens (10%), Proteus vulgaris (9%) and Brenneria nigrifluens (7%). The extracts of all tested plants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the used organisms. The efficiency of the extracts varied with, solvent used in the extraction as well as plant species and the part of plant used. The aqueous extract appeared to be the highly effective extract against all tested organisms especially Fusarium oxysporum causing inhibition zone 48 +/- 0.01 mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 59 +/- 0.02 mm and Salmonella cholerasuis 55 +/- 0.01 mm when using P. crispus, P. pectinatus and C. demersum, respectively. Ethanol extracts of C. demersum, P. crispus and E. crassipes root showed antimicrobial activities against all tested organisms except Aspergillus niger. At the same time the extract of P. pectinatus had no effect also on Fusarium oxysporum and the extract of E. crassipes leaves have no effect on Penicillium italicum. On using chloroform extracts Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum showed resistance. Comparing the effect of different plants extracts C. demersum appeared to be the most effective followed by P. pectinatus. Furthermore, the extracts of E. crassipes leaves being more effective than that, of its roots. Elemental analysis were also takes place in water and plant samples and the results revealed the presence of Mn and Pb in higher concentration in P. pectinatus (Mn 603 +/- 4.243 ppm and Pb 44 +/- 2.828 ppm), at the same time the highest values of Fe 1680 +/- 2.2 ppm, Zn 31.5 +/- 2.1 ppm and Cu 26.5 +/- 2.1 ppm were recorded for C. demersum. Comparing the two parts of E. crassipes (leaves and roots), the roots have the highest values of all studied metals.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aerial parts of Thymus kotschyanus Boiss. and Hohen. (Lamiaceae) and flower buds of Dianthus caryophyllus L. (Caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: Two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. The isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thymol MIC values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and B. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a MIC value of 15.6 microg/ml. Eugenol achieved stronger MIC values against most tested pathogens and the best MIC value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and K. pneumoniae whereas, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and E. coli were inhibited with a MIC value of 31.2 microg/ml. Combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against P. mirabilis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of two antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - [Effect of phytosubstances with antioxidant activity on persistence properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The in vitro effect of phytosubstances containing flavonoids and phenylpropanoids on the antilysozyme activity of varioous groups of microorganisms, such as staphylococci, bacilli, enterobacteria and nonfermenting bacteria was studied. The second fraction of the pink carbonic acid extract showed high antioxidant activity and most efficiently inhibited the ability of various microorganisms to inactivate the host lysozyme. The selected phytosubstance could be useful in clinical practice as an additional antimicrobial agent in etiotropic therapy or prophylaxis of some infections.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of Kenyan medicinal plants.
AB  - Seven medicinal plant extracts traditionally used in Kenya, mainly for management of infectious conditions, were chosen and screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was tested using the broth dilution method. Harrisonia abyssinica and Terminalia kilimandscharica extracts showed significant activity against Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. The methanolic extracts of T. kilimandscharica bark and H. abyssinica bark and leaves showed minimum inhibitory activity against all tested bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 25-150 mg/mL. Ajuga remota and Amaranthus hybridus, which are lethal to brine shrimp nauplii, showed significantly lower antibacterial activity than those that were relatively non-toxic.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Pentanema divaricatum and its active constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ethanol and chloroform extracts of Pentanema divaricatum Cass. was studied using the conventional disk diffusion method. The extracts' highest antimicrobial activity was observed against Aspergillus niger. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract by preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) showed one antimicrobial fraction which was especially effective against Aspergillus niger. By conventional spectroscopy the active fraction was identified as 4alpha,5alpha-epoxy-10alpha,14H-1-epi-inuviscolide. This compound represented the most potent antimicrobial candidate, with MIC values of <25 microg/disk against A. niger strains and 200 microg/disk against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - One-pot synthesis of 5-phenylimino, 5-thieno or 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles and evaluation of their antimicrobial and antitumor activity.
AB  - We here report the synthesis and biological evaluation of rare 4-substituted-5-phenylimino, 5-thieno- and 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles. Dithiazoles were selectively obtained in moderate to high yields (25-73%) via a one-pot reaction from various ethanoneoximes with sulfur monochloride, pyridine in acetonitrile followed by treatment by corresponding nucleophiles (aniline, thioacetamide and formic acid). All the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (against bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonellaenterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus and Listeria inocua), antifungal (against pathogenic strains Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Issatchenkia orientalis) and antitumor (on human cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) activity. 4-(2-Pyridinyl)-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione and 4-ethylcarboxyl-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione (5d, 5h) that are active against Gram-positive bacteria are significantly active against fungi. 4-(2-Benzofuranyl)-5-phenylimino-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole (4e) exerts antiproliferative activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of antibacterial chalcones.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of 31 chalcones was tested against bacterial strains,  Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Some of the tested chalcones showed fair to significant activity against Gram-positive bacteria. By comparison of the results obtained, the antibacterial activity can be related to features such as the presence of a C-4 hydroxyl group, a C-4' oxygenated substituent or a C-3' isoprenoid side chain, while the C-2' hydroxyl group might have importance for the stability of the molecule. The inhibitory effect of chalcones on human pathogenic microorganisms can be correlated with the substitution patterns of the aromatics rings.
TI  - Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos in soil by enriched cultures.
AB  - Three aerobic bacterial consortia, AC, BC, and DC, developed from pesticide-contaminated soils of Punjab were able to degrade chlorpyrifos after 21 days of incubation in basal medium by 54, 46, and 61% and chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in soil after 30 days by 50, 56, and 64%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella sp., and Serratia marscecens obtained from these consortia showed 84, 84, 81, and 80% degradation of chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in liquid medium after 20 days and 92, 60, 56, and 37% degradation of chlorpyrifos (50 mg/L) in soil after 30 days. Populations of Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella sp., and Serratia marscecens remained steady in soil experiments except for P. aeruginosa, where the population showed a substantial increase. Formation of 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol, the major metabolite of chlorpyrifos degradation, was observed during the degradation of chlorpyrifos by P. aeruginosa, which disappeared to negligible amounts.
TI  - Comparative survey of putrescine production from agmatine deamination in different bacteria.
AB  - This article aims to study putrescine production in Lactobacillus hilgardii strain X(1)B, an agmatine degrader isolated from wine, and to compare it with three other different species, previously reported as putrescine producers from agmatine: Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC11700 and Bacillus cereus CECT 148(T). The effect of different biogenic amines, organic acids, cofactors, amino acids and sugars on putrescine production was evaluated. In some cases, a similar effect was found in all the strains studied but the magnitude differed. Arginine, glucose and fructose showed an inhibitory effect, whereas the presence of agmatine induced the production of putrescine in all microorganisms. In other cases, the effect differed between P. aeruginosa PAO1 and the other microorganisms. Histamine and tyramine poorly influenced the utilization of agmatine, although a small increase in putrescine production was observed in P. aeruginosa PAO1. Succinate, spermidine and spermine also led to an increase in putrescine production in P. aeruginosa PAO1, whereas the succinate had no effect in the other microorganisms. Spermine and spermidine always produced a diminution in agmatine deamination. In this work, we have also demonstrated that pyridoxal 5-phosphate, Mg(2+) and Mn(2+) had no effect on putrescine production from agmatine. Results presented in this paper indicate differences in regulation mechanisms of agmatine deiminase pathway among P. aeruginosa PAO1 and L. hilgardii X(1)B, E. faecalis ATCC11700 and B. cereus CECT 148(T). These results are significant from two points of view, first food quality, and second the toxicological and microbiological aspects. It should be taken into account that putrescine, whose origin is still controversial, is quantitatively the main biogenic amine found in food.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial studies of novel 1-benzhydryl-piperazine sulfonamide  and carboxamide derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-benzhydryl-piperazine sulfonamide 8(a-f) and benzamides 9(a-h) were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities evaluated in vitro by paper disc diffusion and micro dilution method against standard strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Staphylococcus epidermis 25212, Bacillus cereus 11778, Bacillus substilis 6051) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 2853 and Salmonella typhi ATCC 9484) bacteria. Among the synthesized new compounds 8d, 8e, 9c, 9e, 9f and 9 h showed potent antimicrobial activities compared to the standard drug streptomycin.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oil of  Foeniculum vulgare Mill.
AB  - In our study, four samples of volatile oil from Foeniculum vulgare, cultivated in different pedoclimatic conditions, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity and chemical composition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Organisms. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans were included in the report. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The comparative inhibitory activity of volatile oil samples with other antimicrobial agents was quantitative determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Oil samples are the volatile oils extracted by steam distillation, from two ecological vegetative populations of Foeniculum vulgare. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the chemical composition of the essential oils. RESULTS: All oil samples have a good activity against E. coli and S. aureus at low concentrations. Against B. cereus and P. aeruginosa these oil samples are less active. The oil samples were generally bactericidal at a concentration up to twofold or fourfold higher than the MIC value. Significantly synergic activity with amoxicillin or tetracycline showed all fennel samples against E. coli, Sarcina lutea and B. subtilis strains. Fennel oil samples have shown high activity against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: No significant antimicrobial activity variations were observed for Foeniculum vulgare volatile oil samples obtained after two or three years cultivation period. The most important identified compounds in all samples of fennel volatile oils were trans-anethole, estragole, fenchone, limonene, alpha-pinene and gamma-terpinene.
TI  - Screening of some Tanzanian medicinal plants from Bunda district for antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - Extracts from 50 plant parts obtained from 39 different plants belonging to 22 families used to treat infectious diseases in Bunda district, Tanzania, were screened against twelve microorganisms, including the bacteria Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium, the fungi Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, and the viruses Herpes Simplex Virus type 1, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus T2, Coxsackie B2 and Semliki Forest A7. The highest activity was obtained for the n-hexane extract of Elaeodendron schlechteranum root bark against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus (MIC 0.97 microg/ml and MBC 1.95 microg/ml) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 3.90 microg/ml and MBC 31.25 microg/ml). Gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive. Only Balanites aegyptiaca stem bark exhibited a high antifungal activity against Candida albicans (MIC 125 microg/ml and MFC 250 microg/ml). Extracts from four plants; Lannea schweinfurthii, Combretum adenogonium, Ficus sycomorus and Terminalia mollis showed strong antiviral activity with RF values of 10(3) and 10(4) against Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 at various concentrations. Our results support, at least in part, the use of most plants as claimed by traditional healers/informants especially against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Challenge testing the lactoperoxidase system against a range of bacteria using different activation agents.
AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LP) exerts antimicrobial effects in combination with H(2)O(2) and either thiocyanate (SCN(-)) or a halide (e.g., I(-)). Garlic extract in the presence of ethanol has also been used to activate the LP system. This study aimed to determine the effects of 3 LP activation systems (LP+SCN(-)+H(2)O(2); LP+I(-)+H(2)O(2); LP + garlic extract + ethanol) on the growth and activity of 3 test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus). Sterilized milk was used as the reaction medium, and the growth pattern of the organisms and a range of keeping quality (KQ) indicators (pH, titratable acidity, ethanol stability, clot on boiling) were monitored during storage at the respective optimum growth temperature for each organism. The LP+I(-)+ H(2)O(2) system reduced bacterial counts below the detection limit shortly after treatment for all 3 organisms, and no bacteria could be detected for the duration of the experiment (35 to 55 h). The KQ data confirmed that the milk remained unspoiled at the end of the experiments. The LP + garlic extract + ethanol system, on the other hand, had no effect on the growth or KQ with P. aeruginosa, but showed a small retardation of growth of the other 2 organisms, accompanied by small increases (5 to 10 h) in KQ. The effects of the LP+SCN(-)+H(2)O(2) system were intermediate between those of the other 2 systems and differed between organisms. With P. aeruginosa, the system exerted total inhibition within 10 h of incubation, but the bacteria regained viability after a further 5 h, following a logarithmic growth curve. This was reflected in the KQ indicators, which implied an extension of 15 h. With the other 2 bacterial species, LP+SCN(-)+H(2)O(2) exerted an obvious inhibitory effect, giving a lag phase in the growth curve of 5 to 10 h and KQ extension of 10 to 15 h. When used in combination, I(-) and SCN(-) displayed negative synergy.
TI  - Method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  - Many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. Like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. The efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. The method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in their original packaging. Dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. The method is applicable to bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), Bacillus cereus spores and fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). These inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. The test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. After incubation at 22.5 degrees C for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. The membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a Stomacher. The supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. The repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the Pharmacopoeias. The lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). The recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = T(0)) is around 90%, regardless of the strain or the test. The number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (W(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (T(0)) and may be considered negligible. Application of this method to different types of wipes demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. The results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. The differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of plant essential oil combinations and interactions with food ingredients.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of plant essential oils  (EOs) in combination and to investigate the effect of food ingredients on their efficacy. The EOs assessed in combination included basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme. Combinations of EOs were initially screened against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the spot-on-agar test. The influence of varying concentrations of EO combinations on efficacy was also monitored using E. coli. These preliminary studies showed promising results for oregano in combination with basil, thyme or marjoram. The checkerboard method was then used to quantify the efficacy of oregano, marjoram or thyme in combination with the remainder of selected EOs. Fractional inhibitory concentrations (FIC) were calculated and interpreted as synergy, addition, indifference or antagonism. All the oregano combinations showed additive efficacy against B. cereus, and oregano combined with marjoram, thyme or basil also had an additive effect against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The mixtures of marjoram or thyme also displayed additive effects in combination with basil, rosemary or sage against L. monocytogenes. The effect of food ingredients and pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of oregano and thyme was assessed by monitoring the lag phase and the maximum specific growth rate of L. monocytogenes grown in model media. The model media included potato starch (0, 1, 5 or 10%), beef extract (1.5, 3, 6 or 12%), sunflower oil (0, 1, 5 or 10%) and TSB at pH levels of 4, 5, 6 or 7. The antimicrobial efficacy of EOs was found to be a function of ingredient manipulation. Starch and oils concentrations of 5% and 10% had a negative impact on the EO efficacy. On the contrary, the EOs were more effective at high concentrations of protein, and at pH 5, by comparison with pH 6 or 7. This study suggests that combinations of EOs could minimize application concentrations and consequently reduce any adverse sensory impact in food. However, their application for microbial control might be affected by food composition, therefore, careful selection of EOs appropriate to the sensory and compositional status of the food system is required. This work shows that EOs might be more effective against food-borne pathogens and spoilage bacteria when applied to ready to use foods containing a high protein level at acidic pH, as well as lower levels of fats or carbohydrates.
TI  - The electrostatic driving force for nucleophilic catalysis in L-arginine deiminase: a combined experimental and theoretical study.
AB  - L-arginine deiminase (ADI) catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine to form L-citrulline and ammonia via two partial reactions. A working model of the ADI catalytic mechanism assumes nucleophilic catalysis by a stringently conserved active site Cys and general acid-general base catalysis by a stringently conserved active site His. Accordingly, in the first partial reaction, the Cys attacks the substrate guanidino C zeta atom to form a tetrahedral covalent adduct, which is protonated by the His at the departing ammonia group to facilitate the formation of the Cys- S-alkylthiouronium intermediate. In the second partial reaction, the His activates a water molecule for nucleophilic addition at the thiouronium C zeta atom to form the second tetrahedral intermediate, which eliminates the Cys in formation of the L-citrulline product. The absence of a basic residue near the Cys thiol suggested that the electrostatic environment of the Cys thiol, in the enzyme-substrate complex, stabilizes the Cys thiolate anion. The studies described in this paper explore the mechanism of stabilization of the Cys thiolate. First, the log(k(cat)/K(m)) and log k(cat) pH rate profiles were measured for several structurally divergent ADIs to establish the pH range for ADI catalysis. All ADIs were optimally active at pH 5, which suggested that the Cys pKa is strongly perturbed by the prevailing electrostatics of the ADI active site. The p K a of the Bacillus cereus ADI (BcADI) was determined by UV-pH titration to be 9.6. In contrast, the pKa determined by iodoacetamide Cys alkylation is 6.9. These results suggest that the negative electrostatic field from the two opposing Asp carboxylates perturbs the Cys pKa upward in the apoenzyme and that the binding of the iodoacetamide (a truncated analogue of the citrulline product) between the Cys thiol and the two Asp carboxylates shields the Cys thiol, thereby reducing its pKa. It is hypothesized that the bound positively charged guanidinium group of the L-arginine substrate further stabilizes the Cys thiolate. The so-called "substrate-assisted" Cys ionization, first reported by Fast and co-workers to operate in the related enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase [Stone, E. M., Costello, A. L., Tierney, D. L., and Fast, W. (2006) Biochemistry 45, 5618-5630], was further explored computationally in ADI by using an ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics method. The energy profiles for formation of the tetrahedral intermediate in the first partial reaction were calculated for three different reaction scenarios. From these results, we conclude that catalytic turnover commences from the active configuration of the ADI(L-arginine) complex which consists of the Cys thiolate (nucleophile) and His imidazolium ion (general acid) and that the energy barriers for the nucleophilic addition of Cys thiolate to the thiouronium C zeta atom and His imidazolium ion-assisted elimination from the tetrahedral intermediate are small.
TI  - Bioactive properties and chemical composition of six walnut (Juglans regia L.) cultivars.
AB  - The chemical composition, antioxidant potential and antimicrobial activity were studied in six walnuts (Juglans regia L.) cultivars (cv. Franquette, Lara, Marbot, Mayette, Mellanaise and Parisienne) produced in Portugal. Concerning their chemical composition the main constituent of fruits was fat ranging from 78.83% to 82.14%, being the nutritional value around 720kcal per 100g of fruits. Linoleic acid was the major fatty acid reaching the maximum value of 60.30% (cv. Lara) followed by oleic, linolenic and palmitic acids. The aqueous extracts of walnut cultivars were investigated by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. All the walnut extracts exhibited antioxidant capacity in a concentration-dependent manner being the lowest EC(50) values obtained with extracts of cv. Parisienne. Their antimicrobial capacity was also checked against gram positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans), revealing activity against the different tested microorganisms.
TI  - Chemical composition, and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of three hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cultivars.
AB  - Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is a very popular dry fruit in the world being consumed in different form and presentations. In the present work, three hazelnut cultivars (cv. Daviana, Fertille de Coutard and M. Bollwiller) produced in Portugal, were characterized in respect to their chemical composition, antioxidant potential and antimicrobial activity. The samples were analysed for proximate constituents (moisture, fat, crude protein, ash), nutritional value and fatty acids profile by GC/FID. Antioxidant potential was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. Their antimicrobial capacity was also checked against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Results showed that the main constituent of fruits was fat ranging from 56% to 61%, being the nutritional value around 650 kcal per 100 g of fruits. Oleic was the major fatty acid varying between 80.67% in cv. F. Coutard and 82.63% in cv. Daviana, followed by linoleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. Aqueous hazelnut extract presented antioxidant activity in a concentration-dependent way, in general with similar behaviour for all cultivars. Hazelnut extracts revealed a high antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (MIC 0.1 mg/mL) showing a good bioactivity of these fruits.
TI  - Antimicrobial triterpenoids from Vladimiria muliensis.
AB  - A new triterpenoid with a rearranged ursane skeleton, 3beta-acetoxyl-11alpha-methoxybauer-8-en-7alpha-ol ( 1), two new ursane triterpenoids, 1alpha,5alpha-dioxy-11alpha-hydroxyurs-12-en-3-one ( 2) and urs-3beta,13alpha,18beta-triol ( 3), together with three known ursane triterpenoids ( 4- 6) were isolated from the rhizome of Vladimiria muliensis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods (IR, EIMS, HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and X-ray crystallography diffraction). Compounds 2 and 4 exhibited modest antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Two new members of streptothricin class antibiotics from Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov.
AB  - Four streptothricin-group antibiotics (1~4) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov. Along with the known antibiotics streptothricins F (1) and D (3), two new members of this class (2, 4) were identified as 12-carbamoyl derivatives of 1 and 3, respectively, mainly by analysis of the IR, HR-MS and NMR spectral data. The antibacterial activities of 1~4 against Escherichia coli (MICs 3.1, 25.0, 3.1 and 12.5 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (MICs 6.3, 25.0, 3.1 and 50 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 12.5, >100.0, 6.3, >100.0 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MICs 25.0, 50.0, 25.0 and 50.0 microg/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 50.0, >100.0, 50.0, >100.0 microg/ml) were assayed by micro-broth dilution. The results based on MIC data indicated that 2 and 4 exhibited significantly less potent antibacterial activities when compared to that of 1 and 3.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of different parts of Tribulus terrestris L. growing in Iraq.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of organic and aqueous extracts from fruits, leaves and roots of Tribulus terrestris L., an Iraqi medicinal plant used as urinary anti-infective in folk medicine, was examined against 11 species of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans using microdilution method in 96 multiwell microtiter plates. All the extracts from the different parts of the plant showed antimicrobial activity against most tested microorganisms. The most active extract against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was ethanol extract from the fruits with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.15 mg/ml against B. subtilis, B. cereus, P. vulgaris and C. diphtheriae. In addition, the same extract from the same plant part demonstrated the strongest antifungal activity against C. albicans with an MIC value of 0.15 mg/ml.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity between Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum  essential oils and methanol extracts.
AB  - Essential oils (EOs) and methanol extracts obtained from aerial parts of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum seeds were evaluated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against nine Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The essential oils and methanol extracts revealed promising antibacterial activities against most pathogens using broth microdilution method. Maximum activity of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum essential oils and methanol extracts (MIC 15.6 and 62.5mug/ml) were observed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris. Combinations of essential oils and methanol extracts showed an additive action against most tested pathogens especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - High incidence of plant growth-stimulating bacteria associated with the rhizosphere of wheat grown on salinated soil in Uzbekistan.
AB  - Soil salinization is increasing steadily in many parts of the world and causes major problems for plant productivity. Under these stress conditions, root-associated beneficial bacteria can help improve plant growth and nutrition. In this study, salt-tolerant bacteria from the rhizosphere of Uzbek wheat with potentially beneficial traits were isolated and characterized. Eight strains which initially positively affect the growth of wheat plants in vitro were investigated in detail. All eight strains are salt tolerant and have some of the following plant growth-beneficial properties: production of auxin, HCN, lipase or protease and wheat growth promotion. Using sequencing of part of the 16S rDNA, the eight new isolates were identified as Acinetobacter (two strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter hormaechei, Pantoae agglomerans and Alcaligenes faecalis. All these strains are potential human pathogens. Possible reasons for why these bacteria present in the rhizosphere and establish there are discussed.
TI  - Inactivation of microbial arginine deiminases by L-canavanine.
AB  - Arginine deiminase (ADI) catalyzes the hydrolytic conversion of L-arginine to ammonia and L-citrulline as part of the energy-producing L-arginine degradation pathway. The chemical mechanism for ADI catalysis involves initial formation and subsequent hydrolysis of a Cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate. The structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa ADI-(L-arginine) complex guided the design of arginine analogs that might react with the ADIs to form inactive covalent adducts during catalytic turnover. One such candidate is L-canavanine, in which an N-methylene of L-arginine is replaced by an N-O. This substance was shown to be a slow substrate-producing O-ureido-L-homoserine. An in depth kinetic and mass spectrometric analysis of P. aeruginosa ADI inhibition by L-canavanine showed that two competing pathways are followed that branch at the Cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate. One pathway leads to direct formation of O-ureido-L-homoserine via a reactive thiouronium intermediate. The other pathway leads to an inactive form of the enzyme, which was shown by chemical model and mass spectrometric studies to be a Cys-alkylisothiourea adduct. This adduct undergoes slow hydrolysis to form O-ureido-L-homoserine and regenerated enzyme. In contrast, kinetic and mass spectrometric investigations demonstrate that the Cys-alkylthiouronium ion intermediate formed in the reaction of L-canavanine with Bacillus cereus ADI partitions between the product forming pathway (O-ureido-L-homoserine and free enzyme) and an inactivation pathway that leads to a stable Cys-alkylthiocarbamate adduct. The ADIs from Escherichia coli, Burkholderia mallei, and Giardia intestinalis were examined in order to demonstrate the generality of the L-canavanine slow substrate inhibition and to distinguish the kinetic behavior that defines the irreversible inhibition observed with the B. cereus ADI from the time controlled inhibition observed with the P. aeruginosa, E. coli, B. mallei, and G. intestinalis ADIs.
TI  - Comparative analysis of polyphenolic profiles and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of tunisian pome fruit pulp and peel aqueous acetone extracts.
AB  - Pome trees, apple, pear, and quince, are classified into the subfamily Pomoideae, belonging to the Rosaceae family. Their autumnal fruits are consumed worldwide in different forms, that is, fresh or transformed into jams, jelly, juices, etc. Their well-established beneficial properties to human health were found mainly related to their phenolic content. Pulp and peel aqueous acetone extracts obtained from Tunisian fruits at commercial maturity were comparatively evaluated for their phenolic profiles and antioxidant and antimicrobial potentials. The phenolic compounds present in the extracts were identified and quantified using RP-HPLC-DAD and ESI-MS techniques. Significant differences in the chromatographic profiles among these fruits, as well as between pulp and peel extracts of each fruit, were observed. Quince, followed by 'Red Delicious', peel extracts showed the highest phenolic content (160.33 and 110.90 mg/100 g of fresh weight). The stronger inhibitory effect on DPPH radicals corresponded to those obtained from peel materials. A comparative analysis of the antimicrobial potential against a range of microorganism strains was also carried out. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus were the most sensitive to the active extracts. Among the examined phenolic extracts, 'Red Delicious' and quince peels showed the highest effects for inhibiting bacteria growth. Minimum inhibitory and bactericide concentrations ranged from 10(2) to 10(4) microg of polyphenol/mL. Red skin apple and quince peels could be of great interest as important antioxidant and antimicrobial polyphenol sources.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of polyphenolic compounds isolated from plants of Geraniaceae and Rosaceae families].
AB  - Polyphenolic compounds present in extracts of plants belonging to the families Geraniaceae (blood-red cranesbill, wood cranesbill, meadow cranesbill, and alfilaria) and Rosaceae (red raspberry, European dewberry, and tormentil) have been tested for their activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the genera Azotobacter, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. The bacteriostatic activity exhibited some species-related features and depended on the polarity of the extracting agent. The bacteriostatic activity of plant-derived phenolic compounds correlated with their antioxidant potential. The plants of the families Geraniaceae and Rosaceae offer promise as a source of raw material for isolation of polyphenolic compounds exhibiting bactericidal activity, including against opportunistic pathogens (B. cereus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus strains).
TI  - Biodegradability of commercial and weathered diesel oils.
AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the capability of different microorganisms to degrade commercial diesel oil in comparison to a weathered diesel oil collected from the groundwater at a petrol station. Two microbiological methods were used for the biodegradability assessment: the technique based on the redox indicator 2,6 -dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) and soil respirometric experiments using biometer flasks. In the former we tested the bacterial cultures Staphylococcus hominis, Kocuria palustris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI, Ochrobactrum anthropi and Bacillus cereus, a commercial inoculum, consortia obtained from soil and groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons and a consortium from an uncontaminated area. In the respirometric experiments it was evaluated the capability of the native microorganisms present in the soil from a petrol station to biodegrade the diesel oils. The redox indicator experiments showed that only the consortia, even that from an uncontaminated area, were able to biodegrade the weathered diesel. In 48 days, the removal of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in the respirometric experiments was approximately 2.5 times greater when the commercial diesel oil was used. This difference was caused by the consumption of labile hydrocarbons, present in greater quantities in the commercial diesel oil, as demonstrated by gas chromatographic analyses. Thus, results indicate that biodegradability studies that do not consider the weathering effect of the pollutants may over estimate biodegradation rates and when the bioaugmentation is necessary, the best strategy would be that one based on injection of consortia, because even cultures with recognised capability of biodegrading hydrocarbons may fail when applied isolated.
TI  - Human chitotriosidase is expressed in the eye and lacrimal gland and has an antimicrobial spectrum different from lysozyme.
AB  - Chitotriosidase is a chitinolytic enzyme expressed by maturing macrophages and preformed in neutrophil granules, suggesting a role in antimicrobial defence. Although available evidence supports a role in anti-fungal immunity, there is a lack of an obvious phenotype in humans homozygous for a mutation which renders chitotriosidase inactive. This may be explained by compensatory effects of enzymes co-expressed with chitotriosidase, such as lysozyme. We have found that chitinase is highly expressed in mouse and human eye, particularly in lacrimal glands. Chitotriosidase is the only member of the chitinase/chilectin gene cluster expressed in the murine eye. As lacrimal glands also produce lysozyme, we have asked whether chitotriosidase, in addition to its documented anti-fungal effects, has synergistic anti-bacterial properties with lysozyme. The effect of recombinant chitotriosidase on the growth of five Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus aureus OatA(+/-)) and two Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), were tested in a luminometric assay. Recombinant chitotriosidase did not inhibit bacterial growth and did not synergize with lysozyme. Though the expression of chitotriosidase in the eye supports a role in innate immunity, the antimicrobial spectrum appears to be complementary to lysozyme and may indeed be limited to fungi.
TI  - Biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial Streptomycetes.
AB  - The strain ANU 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as Streptomyces sp. closely related to Streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16S rRNA analysis. The cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain were recorded. The strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. It had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. A bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-PPA) by FT-IR, EI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral studies. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. flourescens, Staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, F. udum and Penicillium citrinum. The antifungal activity of 3-PPA of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro conditions against Fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. The compound 3-PPA is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide) to control wilt caused by F. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.
TI  - Bioactivity and chemical composition of the leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium and Zanthoxylum setulosum from Monteverde, Costa Rica.
AB  - The leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium and Zanthoxylum setulosum (Rutaceae) from Monteverde, Costa Rica have been obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The principal constituents of Z. rhoifolium leaf oil were germacrene D (14.6%), limonene (12.5%), trans-2-hexenal (11.3%), beta-elemene (9.2%), 2-undecanone (9.2%), myrcene (7.9%), bicyclogermacrene (7.5%), and germacrene A (5.2%). The leaf oil of Z. setulosum was composed largely of beta-phellandrene (37.5%), beta-caryophyllene (13.7%), alpha-pinene (11.9%), germacrene D (10.9%), myrcene (5.9%), and nerolidol (5.4%). The essential oils were screened for in-vitro cytotoxic activity against Hep G2, MCF-7, and PC-3 human tumor cell lines; antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli; and for Artemia salina (brine shrimp) lethality. Neither Z. rhoifolium nor Z. setulosum leaf oils exhibited cytotoxicity or antibacterial activity. Both oils showed activity against A. salina.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Culture-based bacterial detection systems for platelets: the effect of time prior to sampling and duration of incubation required for detection with aerobic culture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) products occurs at low concentrations requiring a period of incubation for growth to minimize sampling error. Culture-based detection methods also need sufficient incubation time; together these periods may limit the useful life of PLTs. This study characterizes the impact of sampling and detection times with two commercially available bacteria detection products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis PLTs inoculated with nine bacterial species at low concentrations were sampled immediately and 24 hours after inoculation. Test results were analyzed after incubation at 16, 20, and 24 hours after sampling with two bacterial detection systems. RESULTS: When sampled immediately after inoculation, two commercially available bacterial detection systems (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux; and eBDS, Pall Corp.) failed to detect some PLTs inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia liquefaciens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. epidermidis, S. liquefaciens, Bacillus cereus, or P. aeruginosa, respectively. The BacT/ALERT was better at 20 hours (p<0.02), but not at 16 or 24 hours for Time 0 sampling. When sampling occurred 24 hours after inoculation, there were no difference between the two systems. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that for either bacteria detection system, holding PLTs for 24 hours before sampling improves the detection sensitivity for PLTs contaminated with low concentrations of bacteria, and longer incubation periods improve detection.
TI  - Effect of natural preservatives on the growth of histamine producing bacteria.
AB  - Present study deals with the hampering of the growth of histamine producing bacteria (HPB), by using NaCl and spices which are easily available and cheaper cost wise. For this experiment, four strains of HPB viz. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis were tested against 1 to 10% concentrations of NaCl and 1 to 5% concentrations of natural preservatives (turmeric, ginger and garlic) in a basal medium. HPB showed different growth rates at different concentrations of NaCl and natural preservatives. V. parahaemolyticus, B. cereus and Ps. aeruginosa showed no growth at 10% concentration. When the HPB growth was tested with garlic, turmeric and ginger extracts, growth of all the bacteria was inhibited by garlic and turmeric extracts at 5% concentration. In ginger, V. parahaemolyticus, B. cereus and P. mirabilis were totally inhibited at 5% concentration. But Ps. aeruginosa showed very less growth at this concentration.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, methanol, and petroleum ether extracts of the lichen Parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent have been screened against twenty eight food-borne bacteria and fungi. All of the extracts with the exception of the petroleum ether extract showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Penicillium notatum. Salazinic acid did not show antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes, P. vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica, and S. faecalis but showed activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium as well. The MIC values of the extracts and the acid for the bacteria and fungi have also been determined.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and related compounds.
AB  - A systematic survey of the antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and some related aromatic aldehydes is reported. A total of 23 different compounds, each at four different concentrations, were studied using a panel of seven microbes (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and employing the paper disc agar diffusion method. Several aldehydes, most notably halogenated, nitro-substituted and hydroxylated salicylaldehydes, displayed highly potent activity against the microbes studied, giving inhibitory zones up to 49 mm in diameter (paper disc diameter 6 mm), while unsubstituted benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde had minimal activity. Further, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde had considerable activity against C albicans and slight activity against S. cerevisiae, while displaying minimal activity against bacteria. Also two aromatic dialdehydes had interesting activity. In general, P. aeruginosa was the least sensitive microbe, a result that is in line with observations from a large screening project, in which this microbe was the one against which the least number of active substances was found. Interestingly, the structure-activity relationships of the aldehydes studied were clearly different for different microbes. Many of the aldehydes tested had such high antimicrobial activity that they are noteworthy candidates for practical applications as well as interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. The structure-activity relationships are discussed in detail. For high activity, substituents are required in benzaldehyde as well as in its 2-hydroxy derivative salicylaldehyde. One hydroxy group alone (at the 2-position) is not enough, but further hydroxylation may produce high activity. The effects of substituents are in some cases dramatic. Halogenation, hydroxylation and nitro substitution may produce highly active compounds, but the effects are not easily predicted nor can they be extrapolated from one microbe to another.
TI  - Carbohydrazones of substituted salicylaldehydes as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials.
AB  - Certain substituted salicylaldehydes are known to have highly potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, but the mechanism underlying this remarkable activity is not known, and almost nothing has been reported on the effects of further modification of the structures, such as the formation of hydrazone-type derivatives. We report now a study on the antimicrobial properties of the carbohydrazone derivatives of several substituted salicylaldehydes. The compounds studied were synthesized from ring-substituted salicylaldehydes and carbohydrazide in the mole ratio 2:1. They were tested against Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus epidermidis using the agar diffusion method. The carbohydrazone derived from 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde had distinctly higher activity than the parent aldehyde in the same molar concentration. This activity was limited to one test organism (S. epidermidis), while the free aldehyde had at least some (in some cases even high) activity against all of the microbes studied. All other ones of the effective carbohydrazone compounds were distinctly less active than the parent salicylaldehydes as such. The hydrazones studied had in general a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the free aldehydes and are thus of interest as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum anti-microbial drugs. The mechanism of action of the aldehydes as well as that of the carbohydrazones is discussed.
TI  - Development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (PE/EVOH) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( Origanum vulgare), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis; the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis; the molds Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium nalgiovense, Eurotium repens, and A spergillus flavus and the yeasts Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Zigosaccharomyces rouxii. Films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria. PP films were more effective than PE/EVOH films. The atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside Petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses showed that the oregano-fortified PP films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified PP films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding PE/EVOH films. Shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. In addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet EU regulations regarding food contact materials. Following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (DI-SDME) and then analyzed by GC-MS. The fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.
TI  - Phenolic compounds and antimicrobial activity of olive (Olea europaea L. Cv. Cobrancosa) leaves.
AB  - We report the determination of phenolic compounds in olive leaves by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and the evaluation of their in vitro activity against several microorganisms that may be causal agents of human intestinal and respiratory tract infections, namely gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). Seven phenolic compounds were identified and quantified: caffeic acid, verbascoside, oleuropein, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, apigenin 7-O-glucoside and luteolin 4'-O-glucoside. At low concentrations olive leaves extracts showed an unusual combined antibacterial and antifungal action, which suggest their great potential as nutraceuticals, particularly as a source of phenolic compounds.
TI  - Diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  - The diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of Eudrilus eugeniae, Lampito mauritii, Eisenia fetida and Perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. While actinomycetes (Streptomyces albus, S. somaliensis, Nocardia asteroides, N. caviae and Saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (Amoeba proteus, A. terricola, Paramecium trichium, Euglena viridis, E. orientalis, Vorticella picta and Trichomonas hominis) and yeast (Candida tropicalis, C. krusei C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. Certain species of fungi (Saksenae vasiformis, Mucor plumbeus, Cladosporium carrionii, C. herbacium, Alternaria sp., Cunninghamella echinulata, Mycetia sterila, Syncephalostrum racemosum, Curvalaria lunata, C. geniculata and Geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacterium antitratum, Mima polymorpha, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. rettgeri, Escherichia coli, Staphylococus citreus, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococci and Micrococci) were completely digested. Certain other species were not digested fungi like Aspergillus fumigatus, A. flavus, A. ochraceous, Trichoderma koningii (except by Eeugeniae), Fusarium moniliforme (except by E. eugeniae) and Rhizopus sp., and bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. The microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in the casts.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by Manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  - Although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. Here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. After being treated with Manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of Pichia pastoris was slightly affected. Microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. Viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed E. coli and B. subtilis cells. Under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) were killed. In the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than L-dopa, N-acetyldopamine (NADA) or N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD) did, suggesting that DHI and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. The antifungal activity of DHI was detected using P. pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Beauveria bassiana. These results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
TI  - Risk factors for post-traumatic endophthalmitis in patients with positive intraocular cultures.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the risk factors for post-traumatic endophthalmitis in patients with positive intraocular culture. METHODS: An institutional-based prospective nonrandomized interventional study of patients older than 15 years who presented for primary repair of open globe injury between June 2003 and April 2005 was undertaken. The main outcomes measured were initial and final visual acuity, type of injury, presence of uveal and vitreous prolapse, time interval between injury and primary repair of the globe, length of wound, location of wound, and virulence of organism. Statistical analysis tests used were Student t-test, Fisher exact test, and chi-square test. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included in the study. They were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=19) patients, who developed clinically significant endophthalmitis; and Group 2 (n=31) patients, who did not develop clinically significant endophthalmitis. Delay in primary repair more than 36 hours (p=0.042), length of wound more than 8 mm (p=0.050), and isolation of organisms like fungus (p=0.006, OR=14), Bacillus cereus (p=0.01, OR=11.25), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p=0.05-0.10, OR=11.3) significantly increased the risk of endophthalmitis. Mean initial and final visual acuity was better in Group 2 but was not statistically significant (p=0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Final visual outcome in the presence of positive intraocular culture is poor. Isolation of virulent organisms, longer length of laceration, and delayed primary repair of open globe injuries have high risk of developing endophthalmitis. Prophylactic intraocular antibiotics should be considered in cases with longer length of wound and delayed primary closure.
TI  - Walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves: phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity and  antioxidant potential of different cultivars.
AB  - Different cultivars of walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves (Cv. Lara, Franquette, Mayette, Marbot, Mellanaise and Parisienne) grown in Portugal, were investigated in what concerns phenolic compounds and antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Phenolics analysis was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD and 10 compounds were identified and quantified: 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3- and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid, quercetin 3-galactoside, quercetin 3-pentoside derivative, quercetin 3-arabinoside, quercetin 3-xyloside and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. The antimicrobial capacity was screened against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Walnut leaves selectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria, being B. cereus the most susceptible one (MIC 0.1mg/mL). Gram negative bacteria and fungi were resistant to the extracts at 100mg/mL. Lara walnut leaves were also submitted to antibacterial assays using 18 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus sp. Antioxidant activity was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. In a general way, all of the studied walnut leaves cultivars presented high antioxidant activity (EC(50) values lower than 1mg/mL), being Cv. Lara the most effective one.
TI  - Nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). METHODS: Several FDA-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. These genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dNK-deficient E. coli strain to various analogues. We overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from S. enterica and B. cereus. RESULTS: The tested Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microM except for a single E. coli isolate and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested AZT concentrations. Purified recombinant S. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated AZT efficiently with a Km of 73.3 microM and k(cat)/Km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-Difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microM. The B. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a Km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microM and k(cat)/Km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) M(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. S. enterica and B. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dNK enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial dNKs efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. Therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of bis[2-amino-4-phenyl-5-thiazolyl] disulfides.
AB  - Different dimeric disulfides, having the basic skeleton of bis[2-amino-4-phenyl-5-thiazolyl] disulfides were synthesized in a straightforward manner from acetophenones. 2-Amino-4-phenyl-1,3-thiazoles were prepared by the reaction of thiourea with substituted acetophenones in the presence of iodine which were then converted to the title compounds. All the compounds were subjected to preliminary evaluation for their biological activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Some of the assayed compounds showed marked activity against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The identification of antibacterial compounds for the development of enhanced media for the detection of foodborne fungi.
AB  - In an effort to identify a more suitable antibiotic for utilization in mycological media, 12 food borne fungal species from various genera including Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Eurotium chevalieri, Fusarium moniliforme, Penicillium sp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida tropicalis, Geotrichum candidum, Rhodotorula glutinis and Kluyveromyces thermotolerans along with 21 chloramphenicol-resistant bacterial isolates from fresh produce and ATCC cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, E. coli, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus spp. were tested for their abilities to grow on dichloran rose bengal agar containing various levels of gentamicin, chlortetracycline or chloramphenicol. Results indicated that all fungal isolates except for Rh. glutinis and R. stolonifer grew well on all media tested. Rh. glutinis did not grow on media containing gentamicin whereas R. stolonifer produced very restricted or no growth on these media. All bacterial isolates from fresh produce, P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and P. fluorescens (ATCC BAA-477) grew well at 100, 125 and 150 mg chloramphenicol/liter medium, but they did not grow on media containing chlortetracycline (100, 125, or 150 mg/L) or gentamicin (15, 25, or 35 mg/L). P. aeruginosa (ATCC 10145) grew well on media containing chloramphenicol or gentamicin, but not in the presence of chlortetracycline. P. carotovorum, E. coli, B. cereus and Staphylococcus spp. did not grow on any of the selective media tested.
TI  - Vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. Finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the EOs (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon EO.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and pollen composition of honey samples collected from different provinces in Turkey.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples from different sources were collected and investigated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736, Morganella morganii, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, and Candida albicans. Pathogens exhibited different sensitivities towards the honey samples. The results showed that majority of the honey samples (75%) generally inhibitied the bacteria tested. The honey samples which were obtained from Izmir (samples 1 and 2) proved more effective as inhibitors against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. The honey which was obtained from Mugla (sample 5) exhibited high anticandidal activity on C. albicans. A comparison of the honey samples on the basis of pollen content revealed that they were heterofloral, and samples which had highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus were dominated by pollen from Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (sample 1), and Trifolium, Trigonella, Cyperaceae, Zea mays and Anthemis taxa (sample 2). The honey proved more effective on bacteria than antibiotics.
TI  - Ceramidase enhances phospholipase C-induced hemolysis by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - We previously reported the purification, molecular cloning, and characterization  of a neutral ceramidase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain AN17 (Okino, N., Tani, M., Imayama, S., and Ito, M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14368-14373; Okino, N., Ichinose, S., Omori, A., Imayama, S., Nakamura, T., and Ito, M. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36616-36622). Interestingly, the gene encoding the enzyme is adjacent to that encoding hemolytic phospholipase C (plcH) in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a well known pathogen for opportunistic infections. We report here that simultaneous production of PlcH and ceramidase was induced by several lipids and PlcH-induced hemolysis was significantly enhanced by the action of the ceramidase. When the strain was cultured with sphingomyelin or phosphatidylcholine, production of both enzymes drastically increased, causing the increase of hemolytic activity in the cell-free culture supernatant. Ceramide and sphingosine were also effective in promoting the production of ceramidase but not that of PlcH. Furthermore, we found that the hemolytic activity of a Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase was significantly enhanced by addition of a recombinant Pseudomonas ceramidase. TLC analysis of the erythrocytes showed that ceramide produced from sphingomyelin by the sphingomyelinase was partly converted to sphingosine by the ceramidase. A ceramidase-null mutant strain caused much less hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes than did the wild-type strain. Sphingosine was detected in the erythrocytes co-cultured with the wild-type strain but not the mutant strain. Finally, we found that the enhancement of PlcH-induced hemolysis by the ceramidase occurred in not only sheep but also human erythrocytes. These results may indicate that the ceramidase enhances the PlcH-induced cytotoxicity and provide new insights into the role of sphingolipid-degrading enzymes in the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbial composition in bioaerosols of a high-throughput chicken-slaughtering facility.
AB  - The microbial composition of the air in various areas of a high-throughput chicken-slaughtering facility was investigated. Over a 4-mo period, 6 processing areas were sampled, and the influence of environmental factors was monitored. The highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, comprising the receiving-killing and defeathering areas, whereas counts decreased toward the evisceration, air-chilling, packaging, and dispatch areas. Maximum microbial counts were as follows: coliforms, 4.9 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); Escherichia coli 3.4 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); Bacillus cereus, 5.0 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Staphylococcus aureus, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7.0 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); presumptive Salmonella spp., 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Listeria monocytogenes, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); and fungi, 1.4 x 10(4) cfu/m(3). Higher counts of airborne microorganisms found in the receiving-killing and defeathering areas indicate the importance of controlling microbial levels before processing to prevent the spread of organisms downstream. This should limit the risk of carrying over contaminants from areas known to generate high counts to areas where the final food product is exposed to air and surface contamination.
TI  - Table olives from Portugal: phenolic compounds, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The phenolic compounds composition, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial activity of different table olives from Portugal, namely, natural black olives "Galega", black ripe olive "Negrinha de Freixo", Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) "Azeitona de Conserva Negrinha de Freixo" olives, and "Azeitona de Conserva de Elvas e Campo Maior" Designation of Origin (DO) olives, were investigated. The analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and seven compounds were identified and quantified: hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, 5-O-caffeoilquinic acid, verbascoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, and luteolin. The antioxidant activity was assessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals, and the beta-carotene linoleate model system. The antioxidant activity was correlated with the amount of phenolics found in each sample. The antimicrobial activity was screened using Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). PDO and DO table olives revealed a wide range of antimicrobial activity. C. albicans was resistant to all the analyzed extracts.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II)] is described. The nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. In all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-O and endocyclic-N of the beta-lactam ring. The new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (a), Klebsiella pneumonae (b), Proteus mirabilis (c), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), Salmonella typhi (e), Shigella dysentriae (f), Bacillus cereus (g), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), Staphylococcus aureus (j) and Streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. All compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.
TI  - Bacteriocin-like inhibitor substances produced by Mexican strains of Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides synthesized and secreted by bacteria and  could potentially be used as natural food preservatives. Here, we report the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitor substances (Bt-BLIS) by five Mexican strains of Bacillus thuringiensis. Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. morrisoni (LBIT 269), B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (LBIT 287), B. thuringiensis subsp kenyae (LBIT 404), B. thuringiensis subsp. entomocidus (LBIT 420) and B. thuringiensis subsp. tolworthi (LBIT 524) produced proteinaceous Bt-BLIS with high levels of activity against Bacillus cereus and other gram-positive bacteria. Although none was active against the gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, Shigella species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the five Bt-BLIS demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera. Biochemical and biophysical studies demonstrated that the five Bt-BLIS could be categorized into two groups, those produced by LBIT 269 and 287 (Group A) and LBIT 404, 420, 524 (Group B), based on relative time of peptide synthesis, distinctive bacterial target specificity and stability in a wide range of temperatures and pH. Because of their stability and bactericidal activities against B. cereus and V. cholerae agents of emetic, diarrheal and lethal syndromes in humans, these Bt-BLIS could potentially be used as biodegradable preservatives in the food industry.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. Nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Penicillium notatum. There was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhimurium, Alternaria citri, Alternaria tenuissima, and Gaeumannomyces graminis. Chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. Physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. Also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.
TI  - Phenolics and antimicrobial activity of traditional stoned table olives 'alcaparra'.
AB  - In the present work, we report the determination of phenolic compounds in 'alcaparra' table olives by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and the evaluation of their extract in vitro activity against several microorganisms that may be causal agents of human intestinal and respiratory tract infections, namely Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). Three flavonoidic compounds were identified and quantified: luteolin 7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, and luteolin. At low concentrations (0.05mg/mL) 'alcaparra' extract revealed significant inhibition of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria growth, with exception of P. aeruginosa. Nevertheless, no antifungal activity was observed at the tested concentrations.
TI  - Preparation and use of media for protease-producing bacterial strains based on by-products from Cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) and wastewaters from marine-products processing factories.
AB  - Cuttlefish powder (CFP) from Sepia officinalis by-products was prepared and tested as a fermentation substrate for microbial growth and protease production by several species of bacteria: Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus BG1, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. All microorganisms studied grew well and produced protease activity when cultivated in medium containing only CFP indicating that the strains can obtain their carbon and nitrogen source requirements directly from whole by-product proteins. Moreover, it was found that the addition to the cuttlefish medium of diluted fishery wastewaters (FWW), generated by marine-products processing factories, enhanced the production of protease. Maximum activity was obtained when cells were grown in cuttlefish media containing 5-times or 10-times diluted FWW. Five-times diluted FWW enhanced protease production by B. cereus BG1 and B. subtilis by 467% and 75% more than control media, respectively. The enhancement could have been due to the high organic content or high salts in FWW. As a result, cuttlefish by-products powder enriched with diluted FWW was found to be a suitable growth media for protease-producing strains. This new process, which converts underutilized wastes (liquid and solid) into more marketable and acceptable forms, coupled with protease production, can be an alternative way to the biological treatment of solid and liquid wastes generated by the cuttlefish processing industry.
TI  - Bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  - Between April 2000 and May 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. Two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by Gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to Gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. Of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were Bacillus licheniformis, three were Bacillus cereus and two were Bacillus pumilus. Seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. B. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. This outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. B. cereus and B. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but B. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except for quinolones and vancomycin. Two deaths were observed. In conclusion, Bacillus spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. Both B. cereus and B. licheniformis may be among the 'new' Gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity studies of ortho-chlorodiarylamines and heteroaromatic tetracyclic systems in the benzo[b]thiophene series.
AB  - ortho-Chlorodiarylamines in the 2,3,7-trimethylbenzo[b]thiophene series were prepared in high yields (70-85%) by C-N palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling using P(t-Bu)(3) as ligand and NaOt-Bu as base. A palladium-assisted C-C intramolecular cyclization of the coupling products gave thienocarbazoles and the dechlorinated diarylamines. Studies of antimicrobial activity of the compounds obtained, against representative species of bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis) and fungi (Candida albicans), were performed. We have also included in the biological assays some pyridine derivatives previously prepared by us, and it was possible to establish some structure-activity relationships (SARs).
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of silver-doped phosphate-based glasses.
AB  - In this study a range of phosphate-based glasses (PBG) doped with silver have been investigated for their antimicrobial activities. In disk diffusion assays, these compositions demonstrated microbistatic effects against a range of organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The data obtained from the above studies allowed for an additional range of PBG containing lower amounts of silver to be studied for their effects on the growth and viability of S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans. PBG containing 3 and 5 mol % Ag were bactericidal for S. aureus and E. coli and significantly decreased the growth rate of C. albicans. A decrease in the dissolution rates of the glasses was seen with increasing Ag content over the range of concentrations investigated. Overall, 3 mol % Ag incorporated into the PBG investigated was sufficient to mount a potent antibacterial effect against the test organisms, and these compositions also gave excellent long-term release of Ag ions into the medium.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial studies of medicinally important novel N-alkyl and N-sulfonyl derivatives of 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]piperazine.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]piperazine derivatives (4a-g) and (5h-m) have been synthesized. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR and 1H NMR. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro for their efficacy as antimicrobial agents against representative strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Bacillus cereus 11778, and Bacillus subtilis 6051) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 2853, and Salmonella typhi ATCC 9484) by paper disc diffusion and microdilution methods. Among the newly synthesized compounds 4e, 5l, and 5m showed potent antimicrobial activities, when compared to the standard drug.
TI  - Biochemical characteristics of chitosanase from the Indonesian Bacillus licheniformis MB-2.
AB  - Bacillus licheniformis MB-2, isolated from a hot spring water in Manado, Indonesia, secreted a unique chitosanase. Media consisted of 0.24% chitosan, 0.25% casiton, 1% MgSO4, 1.4% K2HPO4, 0.02% CaCl2 x 2H2O, 0.002% FeSO4 x 7H2O (w/v) was used for enzyme production. Purification of the enzyme through the hydrophobic interaction chromatography system (butyl Sepharose 4 FF) resulted in two major active fractions; the F2 fraction was shown as a single band at both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymogram analysis with apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. The enzyme worked best at 70 degrees C and pH between 6.0 and 7.0. When incubated at 70, 80, and 90 degrees , the t(1/2) values were 26.56, 18.44, and 16.74 min, respectively with the k constant being at 0.026, 0.037, and 0.04/min. When heated at 90 degrees C, the enzyme retained its activity up to 8 h in the presence of 1 mM MnCl2. The enzyme's activity was unaffected by the presence of 1 M NaCl and 6 M urea but was decreased by 2 M of guanidine hydrochloride. Albeit the enzyme did not degrade colloidal and glycol chitin, it hydrolyzed glycol chitosan up to 0.8% and colloidal chitosan up to 11%. The 85% deacetylated (DDA) soluble chitosan was the most susceptible to this enzyme, followed by 90% and 100% DDA chitosan. The K(m app) values of the 85, 90, and 100% DDA soluble chitosans were found as 0.23, 0.24, and 0.58 mg/mL, whereas the Vmax values were 843, 668, and 261 U/mg, respectively. The hydrolysis products of F2 chitosanase at 24 h incubation (70 degrees C) were pentasaccharide (GlcN)5 and hexasaccharide (GlcN)6. The preliminary test showed inhibitory effect of chitooligosaccharides resulted from enzymatic degradation toward Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) bacterial contamination (PBC) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. It is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PBC was studied by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from July 1991 to December 2004. Active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old PLTs at issue and intermittent use of Gram stain, pH measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (SDP) units. RESULTS: Active surveillance detected 38 instances of PBC, 7 in SDP units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor PLT units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). Contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS; n = 27), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Bacillus cereus (1), Serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 S. bovis, 1 S. uberis), and CONS with viridans group streptococcus (1). Only one instance of contamination, caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. Colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per mL at time of issue. PBC was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through Gram stain screening. Transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). pH testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of SDP units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. CONCLUSION: Improved active surveillance methods for detecting PBC are needed to improve the safety of PLT transfusions.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Screening for antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants used in Colombian folkloric medicine: a possible alternative in the treatment of non-nosocomial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the extracts of Bidens pilosa L., Bixa orellana L., Cecropia peltata L., Cinchona officinalis L., Gliricidia sepium H.B. & K, Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don, Justicia secunda Vahl., Piper pulchrum C.DC, P. paniculata L. and Spilanthes americana Hieron were evaluated against five bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus beta hemolitic, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli), and one yeast (Candida albicans). These plants are used in Colombian folk medicine to treat infections of microbial origin. METHODS: Plants were collected by farmers and traditional healers. The ethanol, hexane and water extracts were obtained by standard methods. The antimicrobial activity was found by using a modified agar well diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MIC was determined in the plant extracts that showed some efficacy against the tested microorganisms. Gentamycin sulfate (1.0 microg/ml), clindamycin (0.3 microg/ml) and nystatin (1.0 microg/ml) were used as positive controls. RESULTS: The water extracts of Bidens pilosa L., Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don, and Piper pulchrum C.DC showed a higher activity against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli than gentamycin sulfate. Similarly, the ethanol extracts of all species were active against Staphylococcus aureus except for Justicia secunda. Furthermore, Bixa orellana L, Justicia secunda Vahl. and Piper pulchrum C.DC presented the lowest MICs against Escherichia coli (0.8, 0.6 and 0.6 microg/ml, respectively) compared to gentamycin sulfate (0.9 8 g/ml). Likewise, Justicia secunda and Piper pulchrum C.DC showed an analogous MIC against Candida albicans (0.5 and 0.6 microg/ml, respectively) compared to nystatin (0.6 microg/ml). Bixa orellana L, exhibited a better MIC against Bacillus cereus (0.2 microg/ml) than gentamycin sulfate (0.5 microg/ml). CONCLUSION: This in vitro study corroborated the antimicrobial activity of the selected plants used in folkloric medicine. All these plants were effective against three or more of the pathogenic microorganisms. However, they were ineffective against Streptococcus beta hemolytic and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their medicinal use in infections associated with these two species is not recommended. This study also showed that Bixa orellana L, Justicia secunda Vahl. and Piper pulchrum C.DC could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Acceleration of epithelial cell syndecan-1 shedding by anthrax hemolytic virulence factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been recently reported that major pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accelerate a normal process of cell surface syndecan-1 (Synd1) ectodomain shedding as a mechanism of host damage due to the production of shedding-inducing virulence factors. We tested if acceleration of Synd1 shedding takes place in vitro upon treatment of epithelial cells with B. anthracis hemolysins, as well as in vivo during anthrax infection in mice. RESULTS: The isolated anthrax hemolytic proteins AnlB (sphingomyelinase) and AnlO (cholesterol-binding pore-forming factor), as well as ClnA (B. cereus homolog of B. anthracis phosphatidyl choline-preferring phospholipase C) cause accelerated shedding of Synd1 and E-cadherin from epithelial cells and compromise epithelial barrier integrity within a few hours. In comparison with hemolysins in a similar range of concentrations, anthrax lethal toxin (LT) also accelerates shedding albeit at slower rate. Individual components of LT, lethal factor and protective antigen are inactive with regard to shedding. Inhibition experiments favor a hypothesis that activities of tested bacterial shedding inducers converge on the stimulation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Syk family, ultimately leading to activation of cellular sheddase. Both LT and AnlO modulate ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, while JNK pathway seems to be irrelevant to accelerated shedding. Accelerated shedding of Synd1 also takes place in DBA/2 mice challenged with Bacillus anthracis (Sterne) spores. Elevated levels of shed ectodomain are readily detectable in circulation after 24 h. CONCLUSION: The concerted acceleration of shedding by several virulence factors could represent a new pathogenic mechanism contributing to disruption of epithelial or endothelial integrity, hemorrhage, edema and abnormal cell signaling during anthrax infection.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Antioxidant and biocidal activities of Carum nigrum (seed) essential oil, oleoresin, and their selected components.
AB  - In the present study, chemical constituents of the essential oil and oleoresin of the seed from Carum nigrum obtained by hydrodistillation and Soxhlet extraction using acetone, respectively, have been studied by GC and GC-MS techniques. The major component was dillapiole (29.9%) followed by germacrene B (21.4%), beta-caryophyllene (7.8%), beta-selinene (7.1%), and nothoapiole (5.8%) along with many other components in minor amounts. Seventeen components were identified in the oleoresin (Table 2) with dillapiole as a major component (30.7%). It also contains thymol (19.1%), nothoapiole (15.2.3%), and gamma-elemene (8.0%). The antioxidant activity of both the essential oil and oleoresin was evaluated in mustard oil by monitoring peroxide, thiobarbituric acid, and total carbonyl and p-anisidine values of the oil substrate. The results showed that both the essential oil and oleoresin were able to reduce the oxidation rate of the mustard oil in the accelerated condition at 60 degrees C in comparison with synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene at 0.02%. In addition, individual antioxidant assays such as linoleic acid assay, DPPH scavenging activity, reducing power, hydroxyl radical scavenging, and chelating effects have been used. The C. nigrum seed essential oil exhibited complete inhibition against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2000 and 3000 ppm, respectively, by agar well diffusion method. Antifungal activity was determined against a panel of foodborne fungi such as Aspergillus niger, Penicillium purpurogenum, Penicillium madriti, Acrophialophora fusispora, Penicillium viridicatum, and Aspergillus flavus. The fruit essential oil showed 100% mycelial zone inhibition against P. purpurogenum and A. fusispora at 3000 ppm in the poison food method. Hence, both oil and oleoresin could be used as an additive in food and pharmaceutical preparations after screening.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Characterization of contamination in and toxicities of a shipyard area in Hong Kong.
AB  - This is the first integrated study on the contaminant characterization and toxicities of a shipyard area. This site in Hong Kong contained 3.6-33.4 mg kg(-1) dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and 5-79 g kg(-1) oil and grease. Other pollutants exceeding the Dutch intervention values were total polyaromatic hydrocarbons, total petroleum hydrocarbons, and metals Cu, Pb and Zn. These pollutants persisted partially owing to the poor fertility with <125 mg N kg(-1) and <530 mg P kg(-1) typical of coastal soil. Sediments collected within 100 m also showed contamination exceeding the China and Hong Kong intervention levels. The shipyard soil killed two bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri and Acinetobacter sp. isolated from a clean coastal soil, inhibited germination of three exogenous plants Triticum aestivum, Brassica chinense and Lolium perenne, and inhibited proliferation of three indigenous bacteria: Methylobacterium sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Thus, ex situ remediation was needed.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of coumarins.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of coumarin per se and other 45 coumarin derivatives was tested against strains of Bacillus cereus MIP 96016, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The inhibitory effects of coumarins were affected by their substitution patterns. Osthenol (44) showed the most effective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria with MIC values ranging between 125 and 62.5 microg/ml. These results suggested that the prenyl chain of 44 at position 8 and the presence of OH at position 7 of the benzenic ring are required for the antibacterial activity against these strains.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Use of oligonucleotide array for identification of six foodborne pathogens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on selective media.
AB  - Identification of presumptive foodborne pathogens grown on selective media may take one to several days and requires a different battery of biochemical tests for each microorganism. A molecular identification method was developed in which universal primers were used to amplify the 16S to 23S rDNA intergenic spacer of target microorganisms, and PCR products were hybridized to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides that were immobilized on a nylon membrane. The seven target microorganisms were Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. After testing a large collection of target bacteria (29 to 51 strains) and nontarget bacteria (> 500 strains), the performances (sensitivity and specificity) of the oligonucleotide array were as follows: B. cereus (100 and 77%), E. coli (100 and 100%), L. monocytogenes (100 and 90%), P. aeruginosa (100 and 100%), Salmonella (100 and 100%), S. aureus (100 and 100%), and V. parahaemolyticus (100 and 94.2%). Other species in the B. cereus group cross-hybridized to the probes used for identification of B. cereus, and positive results should be confirmed by additional morphological observation of colonies. Listeria innocua cross-reacted with probes used to identify L. monocytogenes, but a simple hemolysis test was used to differentiate the two species. Some strains of Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio mimicus cross-hybridized with probes used for identification of V. parahaemolyticus and caused false-positive reactions. The advantage of the array is that a common protocol was used to identify the seven target microorganisms and multiple different microorganisms could be simultaneously identified on a single array.
TI  - Optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on bacterial 16S rDNA, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. In the present study, this real-time PCR method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routinely prepared PCs were spiked with suspensions of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. The presence of bacteria in these PCs was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR. As a reference method (additional control), BacT/Alert automated culturing was used. For PCR, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) PCs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. As a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic BacT/Alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. RESULTS: With quantitative real-time PCR, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml. Bacteria were also detected on day 1 from PCs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 CFU/ml, except for E. coli, which was detected in only one of the three samples and P. aeruginosa, for which analysis was not performed on day 1. With the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of P. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PCR enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in PCs. For reliable detection, our results support that sampling of PCs for real-time PCR screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). Importantly, the real-time PCR approach has the potential to be used before the release of PCs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.
TI  - Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
AB  - Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevis FMC3, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 5, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Bacillus cereus EU, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Yersinia enterocolytica, Listeria monocytogenes scoot A, Bacillus megaterium EU, Bacillus megaterium DSM32, Klebsiella oxytocica, Staphylococcus aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. The LPO--100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon (Cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), basil (Ocimum basillicum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), dill (Anethum graveolens), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Rare trisubstituted sesquiterpenes daucanes from the wild Daucus carota.
AB  - Phytochemical and biological investigation of the roots of the wild Daucus carota ssp. carota afforded three new and four known compounds, including four sesquiterpenes daucane esters (1-3 [new], and 4), one polyacetylene (5), one sesquiterpene coumarin (6), and sitosterol glucoside. The structures of the new compounds were determined by comprehensive NMR studies, including DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HMQC and HMBC analyses. Based on an agar diffusion assay, 1, 2 and 4-6 were screened and found to contain a range of low antibacterial activities against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces scabies, Bacillus subtilus, Bacillus cereus) and two gram negative species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) as well as antifungal against Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger using cup agar diffusion assay.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin 217 produced by natural isolate Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16.
AB  - The strain Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (Bac217; approximately 7 kDa). The onset of Bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees C, respectively, when culture entered the early stationary phase. Biochemical characterization showed that Bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of pH 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees C for 6 months or -20 degrees C for up to 12 months. However, Bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. BGBUK2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. Plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for Bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. Bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Interestingly, Bac217 showed activity against Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853. The inhibitory effect of BGBUK2-16 on the growth of S. aureus in mixed culture was observed. S. aureus treatment with Bac217 led to a considerable decrease (CFU/ml) within a short period of time. The mode of Bac217 action on S. aureus was identified as bactericidal. It should be noted that the strain BGBUK2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.
TI  - Biologically active traditional medicinal herbs from Balochistan, Pakistan.
AB  - The biological activities of the following four important medicinal plants of Balochistan, Pakistan were checked; Grewia erythraea Schwein f. (Tiliaceae), Hymenocrater sessilifolius Fisch. and C.A. Mey (Lamiaceae), Vincetoxicum stocksii Ali and Khatoon (Asclepiadaceae) and Zygophyllum fabago L. (Zygophyllaceae). The methanolic extracts were fractionated into hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, butanol and water. The antifungal and antibacterial activities of these plants were determined against 12 fungal and 12 bacterial strains by agar well diffusion and disk diffusion assays. The extract of Zygophyllum fabago was found to be highly effective against Candida albicans and Escherichia coli. The extract of Vincetoxicum stocksii was also found to be significantly active against Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Extracts of Hymenocrater sessilifolius and Grewia erythraea showed good activity only against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Detection and identification of bacteria in a juice matrix with Fourier transform-near infrared spectroscopy and multivariiate analysis.
AB  - The use of Fourier transform-near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate pattern recognition techniques was evaluated to address the need for a fast and senisitive method for the detection of bacterial contamination in liquids. The complex cellular composition of bacteria produces FT-NIR vibrational transitions (overtone and combination bands), forming the basis for identification and subtyping. A database including strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus thuringiensis was built, with special care taken to optimize sample preparation. The bacterial cells were treated with 70% (vol/vol) ethanolto enhance safe handling of pathogenic strains and then concentrated on an aluminum oxide membrane to obtain a thin bacterial film. This simple membrane filtration procedure generated reproducible FT-NIR spectra that allowed for the rapid discrimination among closely related strains. Principal component analysis and soft independent modeling of class analogy of transformed spectra in the region 5,100 to 4,400 cm(-1) were able to discriminate between bacterial species. Spectroscopic analysis of apple juices inoculated with different strains of E. coli at approximately 10(5) CFU/ml showed that FT-NIR spectralfeatures are consistent with bacterial contamination and soft independent modeling of class analogy correctly predicted the identity of the contaminant as strains of E. coli. FT-NIR in conjunction with multivariate techniques can be used for the rapid and accurate evaluation of potential bacterial contamination in liquids with minimal sample manipulation, and hence limited exposure of the laboratory worker to the agents.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - Screening of antimicrobial activity of diarylamines in the 2,3,5-trimethylbenzo[b]thiophene series: a structure-activity evaluation study.
AB  - Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis), Gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) bacteria, and Candida albicans as a representative of fungi were used for screening the in vitro antimicrobial activity of diarylamines in the 2,3,5-trimethylbenzo[b]thiophene series bearing different substituents, synthesized by us using the palladium-catalyzed C-N coupling methodology. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and structure-activity relationships (SARs) were evaluated.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Mesophilic aerobic degradation of a metal lubricant by a biological consortium.
AB  - The metal-forming industries require the use of greases to lubricate metal surfaces during manufacturing operations, and the residues of these lubricants must be removed prior to finishing processes to protect and improve the appearance of the final product. An aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process operating under mild conditions (pH 9, 42 degrees C) eliminates the use of environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. This process was characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. The metal lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. The maximum degradation rate Vmax and the apparent Km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein) and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day l) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis, respectively. Mineralization of the metal lubricant was shown by analyzing the evolved CO2 and Cl-, and the bacterial consortium utilized the metal lubricant as a sole carbon and energy source (micro=0.05+/-0.01 h(-1) at 0.5 vol% lubricant concentration). The active bacteria in the biological metal-cleaning process were identified as Bacillus licheniformis for the higher lubricant concentrations (3, 5, and 7.5 vol%), Bacillus cereus at 1 vol%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhizobiaceae strain M100, and Achromobacter sp. LMG 5431 at 0.3 vol%.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Influence of the cell wall on ciprofloxacin susceptibility in selected wild-type  Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The susceptibility of several wild-type bacteria to ciprofloxacin and accumulation of the drug in these bacteria were evaluated. Species studied included Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was measured for each strain using two different methods: the minimal inhibitory concentration and the bactericidal index. Significant differences were observed between the results derived from these two methods. Whereas the minimal inhibitory concentration was low in all strains tested, ciprofloxacin's bactericidal activity, as indicated by the bactericidal index, varied with the species studied. To determine whether this finding was due to variations in cell envelope permeability to ciprofloxacin (i.e. to combined cell uptake and efflux), we studied ciprofloxacin accumulation using spectrofluorometry. In Gram-negative bacteria, differences in permeability can lead to altered susceptibility to antibiotics. In fact, the combination of slow uptake and efficient efflux seems to be crucial to the characteristic poor susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. However, the low level of activity of ciprofloxacin against S. aureus and two Bacillus species may have resulted from the drug's interaction with its target enzymes (i.e. topoisomerase IV in S. aureus and DNA gyrase in Bacillus spp.) rather than diminished permeability.
TI  - Evaluation of the sanitization effectiveness of a denture-cleaning product on dentures contaminated with known microbial flora. An in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To see if dentures contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, and herpes simplex virus 1 could be effectively decontaminated by using Medical Tabs for Dentures. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Ten methylmethacrylate dentures with processed soft liners (soft-liner dentures) and 10 methylmethacrylate dentures without processed soft liners (hard dentures) were aseptically fragmented and individually incubated with a target microorganism. Test denture fragments were immersed in Medical for 5 minutes, vortexed for 5 minutes, and serially diluted onto media. The control denture fragments were similarly treated in sterile water. For virus contamination, denture fragments were contaminated with 1.2 x 10(9) tissue culture infective dose (TCID)50/mL. They were treated with either Medical for 5 minutes (test fragments) or water (controls) for 5 minutes. Serial dilutions were performed and viral (TCID)50/mL titers were calculated using the Reed-Muench method. RESULTS: Medical treatments effectively eliminated C. albicans, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa from soft-liner dentures. Treatment of hard dentures eradicated C. albicans and reduced the numbers of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to < 10. B. cereus showed a reduction of 10 microorganisms in hard dentures while the soft-liner dentures did not show an appreciable reduction. Viral analyses found that both types of dentures retained large amounts of virus when washed with water, but no virus was recovered from any of the 40 samples treated with Medical. CONCLUSION: A single use of Medical Tabs for Dentures is effective in eliminating certain species of microorganisms, including selected viruses, in vitro.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Composition and bioactivity of the leaf essential oil of Heteropyxis dehniae from Zimbabwe.
AB  - The leaf oil of Heteropyxis dehniae Suess. (Heteropyxidaceae) was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/MS. The most abundant essential oil components are linalool (58.3%), 4-terpineol (9.8%), alpha-terpineol (3.6%), and caryophyllene oxide (3.1%). The antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger, and the in vitro cytotoxicity of the oil on PC-3, MDA-MB-231, Hs 578T, MCF7, SK-MEL-28, and 5637 human tumor cells were also examined. Caryophyllene oxide shows notable cytotoxic activity with LC50 values of 147-351 microM.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe Carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. Cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees C. Extracts of immature, mature and ripe Carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. Sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. The inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. Anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. Seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: B cereus > E coli > S faecalis > S aureus > P vulgaris > S flexneri. No significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. No inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. Carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. Carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Artemisia douglasiana leaf essential oil.
AB  - Artemisia douglasiana leaf has been shown to be efficacious complementary herbal  treatment for chronic bladder infection in a paraplegic youth. The leaf oil has been analyzed by GC-MS and the major components found to be camphor (29%), artemisia ketone (26%), artemisia alcohol (13%), alpha-thujone (10%), 1,8-cineole (8%), and hexanal (5%). The leaf oil and the major components have been tested for antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. The essential oil shows limited antimicrobial activity in vitro, so it is unclear if the oil exerts a direct antimicrobial effect in vivo, or plays some role in stimulation of host defenses.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
AB  - A water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against Escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. This 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (LMWC), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kDa, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. LMWC has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does LMWC. Accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against E. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of LMWC.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Cetraria aculeata and its protolichesterinic acid constituent.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activity of the acetone, diethyl ether and ethanol extracts of the lichen Cetraria aculeata has been investigated. The extracts were tested against twelve bacteria and eight fungi and found active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes. No antimicrobial activity against the fungi was detected. It was determined that only one substance in the extracts has antimicrobial activity and it was characterized as protolichesterinic acid. The MICs of the extracts and protolichesterinic acid were also determined.
TI  - Detection and characterization of the novel bacteriocin entomocin 9, and safety evaluation of its producer, Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. entomocidus HD9.
AB  - AIMS: To identify and characterize new bacteriocins from a collection of 41 strains belonging to 27 subspecies of Bacillus thuringiensis, and to evaluate the safety of the producers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. entomocidus HD9 produced in the culture supernatant an antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including Listeria monocytogenes, one of four pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several fungi. Production of the antibacterial activity, named entomocin 9, started during mid-logarithmic growth reaching its maximum at the early stationary phase. Entomocin 9 retained more than 72% of activity after incubation for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Activity was lost after proteinase K treatment, it was stable in a pH range between 3 and 9, and resistant to lyophilization. After partial purification with ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by gel-filtration and anion-exchange chromatography, an active protein of ca 12.4 kDa was isolated. The mode of action of entomocin 9 was bactericidal and caused cell lysis of growing cells. Despite the presence of a range of virulence related genes, including haemolysin BL, nonhaemolytic enterotoxin, cytotoxin K and several hydrolytic activities, B. thuringiensis HD9 was not toxic against Vero cells. CONCLUSIONS: Entomocin 9 is a novel heat-stable, bacteriocin produced by B. thuringiensis HD9. The absence of toxicity against Vero cells suggests the suitability of strain HD9 for a safe application in antimicrobial treatments. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: New finding on entomocin 9 would make B. thuringiensis attractive in biotechnological applications as an antimicrobial agent in agriculture and food industry.
TI  - Microbial and copper adsorption by smectitic clay--an experimental study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantify copper-, bacteria- and bacteriophage-binding capacities of natural clay with the aim of predicting the adsorption of heavy metals, human pathogenic bacteria and viruses by a clayey landfill liner. X-ray diffraction analysis of six natural clays showed that the dominant phase in all deposits consists of smectites together with illite, kaolin and, sometimes, palygorskite and sepiolite. The specific surface areas of different clay substrates were very high ranging from 293 to 351 m2 g(-1), and indicating a high proportion of phyllosilicates, consisting especially of smectites. The physico-chemical identification of separated smectites showed a high potential adsorbent character indicative of a large industrial use. The Kb12 smectite substrate chosen arbitrarily among six separated substrates, appeared as an excellent copper adsorbent. Copper was adsorbed to clay in a proportion ranging from 94.6 to 96.0% with an average of 95.1% and its adsorption occurred rapidly in less than 30 min. Organic contents of the clay substrate, evaluated as 17% of dry mass, may contribute and enhance copper adsorption. Different elution protocols using distilled water, 2 and/or 5% nitric acid revealed that while nitric acid resulted in the removal of more than 59% of the metal at the lower concentration and its complete depletion with a further elution at the higher concentration, distilled water alone was unable to remove more than 1% of adsorbed copper. This finding suggested that copper ions form high-energy bonds with layer-silicate surfaces. Interestingly, the use of a regenerated substrate as copper adsorbent subsequent to abundant washings of the used substrate consecutively, with 0.1 N HNO3 and distilled water, reduced copper adsorption by approximately 14%, suggesting a slight disturbance of clay initial structure. Batch adsorption experiments with phage T7 and raw clay Kb12 showed that the tested clay substrate appeared as a relatively moderate phage adsorbent since the quantity of adsorbed phage averaged 98.2 +/- 0.88% (2 log10 retention) as measured by infectivity for Escherichia coli ATCC 11303. As shown by two types of separating procedures, natural sedimentation and a low speed centrifugation, bacteriophage particles were bound essentially to fine and not to relatively coarse particles of the clay suspension. The retention capacity of purified clay Kb12 appeared low, with average values lower than 60 and 50%, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 1135, respectively. A significant increase of retention, in the order of 30%, was found for both bacteria when the mixture clay-bacteria was incubated at laboratory temperature for 6 hours.
TI  - Microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  - Bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. It is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum-sensing signals. In this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of AHL-producing and AHL-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. We showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter agglomerans, produced AHL signals. We also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., Agrobacterium tumefaciens XJ01, Bacillus cereus XJ08, and Ralstonia sp. XJ12, expressed AHL degradation enzymes. Furthermore, we showed that P. aeruginosa isolate HL43 was virulent against animal model Caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than P. aeruginosa strains PA01 and PA14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. These data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - Aerobic tryptophan degradation pathway in bacteria: novel kynurenine formamidase.
AB  - While a variety of chemical transformations related to the aerobic degradation of L-tryptophan (kynurenine pathway), and most of the genes and corresponding enzymes involved therein have been predominantly characterized in eukaryotes, relatively little was known about this pathway in bacteria. Using genome comparative analysis techniques we have predicted the existence of the three-step pathway of aerobic L-tryptophan degradation to anthranilate (anthranilate pathway) in several bacteria. Based on the chromosomal gene clustering analysis, we have identified a previously unknown gene encoding for kynurenine formamidase (EC 3.5.1.19) involved with the second step of the anthranilate pathway. This functional prediction was experimentally verified by cloning, expression and enzymatic characterization of recombinant kynurenine formamidase orthologs from Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Ralstonia metallidurans. Experimental verification of the inferred anthranilate pathway was achieved by functional expression in Escherichia coli of the R. metallidurans putative kynBAU operon encoding three required enzymes: tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (gene kynA), kynurenine formamidase (gene kynB), and kynureninase (gene kynU). Our data provide the first experimental evidence of the connection between these genes (only one of which, kynU, was previously characterized) and L-tryptophan aerobic degradation pathway in bacteria.
TI  - Essential oil analysis and antimicrobial activity of eight Stachys species from Greece.
AB  - The volatile composition of eight Stachys species has been studied. The investigated taxa were St. alopecuros (L.) Bentham., St. scardica (Griseb.) Hayek, St. cretica L. ssp. cretica, St. germanica L. ssp. heldreichii (Boiss.) Hayek, St. recta L., St. spinulosa L., St. euboica Rech. and St. menthifolia Vis., growing wild in Greece. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation in a modified Clevenger-type apparatus, and their analyses were performed by GC and GC-MS. Identification of the substances was made by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices with literature records. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were shown to be the main group of constituents of all taxa. Furthermore, the obtained essential oils were tested against the following six bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35210), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 10907), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 2228), as well as against the following five fungi: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Penicillium ochrochloron (ATCC 9112), Epidermophyton floccosum (clinical isolates), Candida albicans (clinical isolates) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (clinical isolates). The tested essential oils showed better activity against bacterial species than against fungi. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant strain, as none of the essential oils was active against this strain. The essential oil of St. scardica has been proven most active against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae) is reported. Four oils from plants growing in different environmental conditions were characterized by GC and GC-MS methods; the oils seem to indicate a new chemotype in the genus Thymus. Influences of soil and altitude characteristics on the essential oil composition are discussed. The oils showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimuium Ty2, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria.
TI  - Thiols as classical and slow-binding inhibitors of IMP-1 and other binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of a variety of thiol compounds on the function of binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases, with a particular focus on IMP-1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been investigated. Thiol inhibitors, depending on their structural features, fall into two categories, one in which inhibition at neutral pH was instantaneous and the other in which inhibition was time-dependent. While mercaptans with anionic substituents in the vicinity of their SH groups exhibited the former type of inhibition, neutral thiols appear to induce a slow, time-dependent isomerization of the initially formed EI complex to a tighter EI complex. Kinetic parameters describing the latter process were obtained by fitting progress curves of substrate hydrolysis using standard and numerical procedures. The failure of charged thiols to exhibit slow binding is suggested to be due to a rapid isomerization of the initial EI complex. Slow binding in the case of neutral thiols was observed only below pH 8. Studies on the pH dependence of catalysis by IMP-1 revealed that (i) enzyme inactivation at low pH is a slow process with presumably two groups with a pK(a) of approximately 5.2 in the protein being responsible for the loss of activity, (ii) inhibition by thiols is independent of pH between pH 5 and 9, and (iii) an apparent enhancement of the catalytic activity of IMP-1 by thiols occurs at pH <5. The last mentioned phenomenon is explained by a model in which mercaptans retard the proton-dependent isomerization of the enzyme. Studies on the thiol-mediated inhibition of the binuclear forms of Bacteroides fragilis (CcrA) and Bacillus cereus (BcII strain 5/B/6) metallo-beta-lactamase have revealed that while CcrA was instantaneously albeit moderately inhibited by mercaptans, BcII mimicked IMP-1 in its interaction with thiols. These differences are proposed to be due partly to the structural divergence of these proteins in the vicinity of Zn2.
TI  - Eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  - This study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. The electrophoretic profile of SDS-PAGE showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. Three bacteria species, Pseudomonas aureginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/mL). On the other hand, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. The present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.
TI  - Application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - A spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. The system (termed LEXSAS, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. We studied the LEXSAS as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. If successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. In this study, we used the LEXSAS for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. The results indicate that the LEXSAS could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.
TI  - A novel class of microbial phosphocholine-specific phospholipases C.
AB  - In this report we describe the 1,500-fold purification and characterization of the haemolytic phospholipase C (PLC) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the paradigm member of a novel PLC/phosphatase superfamily. Members include proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bordetella spp., Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei. Purification involved overexpression of the plcHR1,2 operon, ion exchange chromatography and native preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of two proteins in the purified sample with sizes of 17,117.2 Da (PlcR2) and 78,417 Da (PlcH). Additionally, liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LCMS) revealed that PlcH and PlcR2 are at a stoichiometry of 1 : 1. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the enzyme purifies as a heterodimeric complex, PlcHR2. PlcHR2 is only active on choline-containing phospholipids. It is equally active on phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) and is able to hydrolyse plasmenylcholine phospholipids (plasmalogens). Neither PlcHR2 nor the M. tuberculosis homologues are inhibited by D609 a widely used, competitive inhibitor of the Bacillus cereus PLC. PlcH, PlcR2, and the PlcHR2 complex bind calcium. While calcium has no detectable effect on enzymatic activity, it inhibits the haemolytic activity of PlcHR2. In addition to being required for the secretion of PlcH, the chaperone PlcR2 affects both the enzymatic and haemolytic properties of PlcH. Inclusive in these data is the conclusion that the members of this PC-PLC and phosphatase family possess a novel mechanism for the recognition and hydrolysis of their respective substrates.
TI  - Simultaneous multiple substrate tag detection with ESI-ion trap MS for in vivo bacterial enzyme activity profiling.
AB  - A bacterial identification method in which multiple enzyme activities are measured simultaneously and in vivo with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) is described. Whole-cell bacteria are immobilized onto a filter support and incubated with a mixture of substrates. Each substrate is chosen to measure a specific enzyme activity of a targeted bacterium and to produce a tag of unique molecular weight. After a predetermined incubation time, the solution is filtered, and the supernatant consisting of a mixture of released tags and unhydrolyzed substrates is directly analyzed, without chromatographic separation, by ESI-MS. Bacteria remain viable on the filter for further analyses. The method was tested by measuring the aminopeptidase activity of the bacteria Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The resulting aminopeptidase enzyme profiles allowed the differentiation between the four bacteria tested. The method is rapid, since a multiplex advantage is realized when assaying for multiple enzymes, and it is amenable to automation via a flow injection analysis setup.
TI  - Screening of some Siberian medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extracts of 16 Siberian medicinal plants was tested against five species of microorganisms: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. Of the 16 plants tested, 12 showed antimicrobial activity against one or more species of microorganisms. The most active antimicrobial plants were Bergenia crassifolia, Chelidonium majus, Rhaponticum carthamoides, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Tussilago farfara.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids haminol and pulo'upone and related compounds.
AB  - The marine alkaloids haminol A, haminol B and pulo'upone as well as 17 related compounds (twelve 2-substituted pyridine derivatives, four 3-substituted ones and one analogue of the bicyclic terminus of pulo'upone) were tested for antimicrobial activity against a panel of six microbes (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using the paper disc agar diffusion method. Six compounds were tested also against the mold Aspergillus niger. Some of the compounds displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity, only one congener being completely devoid of activity. Nearly all compounds had activity against B. cereus and S. epidermidis. The growth of E. coli, C albicans and S. cerevisiae was also distinctly inhibited by many compounds. In contrast, most compounds were inactive or had minimal activity against P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, most of the compounds tested against the opportunistic pathogen A. niger were active, one of them having noteworthy inhibitory potency.
TI  - New labdene iterpenes from Eupatorium glutinosum.
AB  - The new diterpene glucoside 3,15-dihydroxy-ent-labd-7-en-17-oic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (1) and its aglycone (2) have been isolated from Eupatorium glutinosum. The structures were determined by IR, one- and two-dimensional NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, chemical transformations, and comparison of spectroscopic data with closely related diterpenes. Crude extracts showed antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, but compounds 1 and 2 showed only antimicrobial activity. These results support the vernacular medicinal use of the plant as an antimicrobial.
TI  - Identification of a series of tricyclic natural products as potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  - This work describes the discovery and characterization of a novel series of tricyclic natural product-derived metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. Natural product screening of the Bacillus cereus II enzyme identified an extract from a strain of Chaetomium funicola with inhibitory activity against metallo-beta-lactamases. SB236050, SB238569, and SB236049 were successfully extracted and purified from this extract. The most active of these compounds was SB238569, which possessed K(i) values of 79, 17, and 3.4 microM for the Bacillus cereus II, Pseudomonas aeruginosa IMP-1, and Bacteroides fragilis CfiA metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively, yet none of the compounds exhibited any inhibitory activity against the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia L-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (50% inhibitory concentration > 1,000 microM). The lack of activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme and serine beta-lactamases demonstrated the selective nature of these compounds. The crystal structure of SB236050 complexed in the active site of CfiA has been obtained to a resolution of 2.5 A. SB236050 exhibits key polar interactions with Lys184, Asn193, and His162 and a stacking interaction with the indole ring of Trp49 in the flap, which is in the closed conformation over the active site groove. SB236050 and SB238569 also demonstrate good antibacterial synergy with meropenem. Eight micrograms of SB236050 per ml gave rise to an eightfold drop in the MIC of meropenem for two clinical isolates of B. fragilis producing CfiA, making these strains sensitive to meropenem (MIC < or = 4 microg/ml). Consequently, this series of metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibit the most promising antibacterial synergy activity so far observed against organisms producing metallo-beta-lactamases.
TI  - Recent developments in carbapenems.
AB  - Carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics characterised by the presence of a beta-lactam ring with a carbon instead of sulfone in the 4-position of the thyazolidinic moiety. The first carbapenem to be utilised in therapy was imipenem, the N-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin. Imipenem is coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of human renal dehydropeptidase I, as imipenem is hydrolysed by this enzyme. Meropenem was the first carbapenem with a 1-beta-methyl group and 2-thio pyrrolidinyl moiety, which renders this antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase I. Other carbapenems for parenteral administration later discovered include biapenem, panipenem, ertapenem, lenapenem, E-1010, S-4661 and BMS-181139. Carbapenems which are orally administered include sanfetrinem, DZ-2640, CS-834 and GV-129606. Carbapenems have an ultra-broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and stability to almost all clinically relevant beta-lactamases. This differentiates them from all other currently available classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. However, Class B beta-lactamases, along with some rare Class A and D enzymes, are able to hydrolyse these antibiotics. Although Class B enzymes are generally chromosomally-encoded (isolated from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas spp., Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Flavobacterium spp. and Legionella gormanii), plasmid-metallo-beta-lactamases now are appearing in B. fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and members of Enterobacteriaceae such as Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The number of these enzymes compared to the number of other beta-lactamase types is still low, however, it is likely that they will spread due to the increased selective pressure of carbapenem use. The very broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity associated with a good clinical efficacy and a favourable safety profile makes the carbapenems valuable as 'first-line' antibiotics in initial empirical therapy for the treatment of severe infections.
TI  - Rheological characteristics of microbial suspensions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The rheological properties of the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus have been investigated. The apparent viscosity of the bacterial suspensions has been measured at different conditions. The results showed that the bacterial suspensions' apparent viscosity increased with increasing biomass concentration of each of these strains. The P. aeruginosa suspension followed shear thinning behavior while B. cereus suspension followed shear thickening behavior. The shear stress versus shear rate experimental data were best represented by the Herschel-Bulkley model. The apparent viscosity of the P. aeruginosa and B. cereus suspensions decreased with increasing temperature. The relationship between the apparent viscosity and the shearing time highlighted the rheopectic behavior of the suspensions used in this work.
TI  - Gas sensor arrays for early detection of infection in mammalian cell culture.
AB  - The detection of bacterial infections in a mammalian cell culture process is realised using a gas sensor array. In production-scale and laboratory-scale cultivations of a perfused recombinant CHO-cell culture producing human blood coagulation Factor VIII, we show that the gas sensor array identifies bacterial contamination earlier than conventional methods. The sensitivity of the instrument is verified by inoculation of a blank cell culture medium with defined bacterial cell counts.
TI  - Functional control of the binuclear metal site in the metallo-beta-lactamase-like fold by subtle amino acid replacements.
AB  - At present there are three protein families that share a common structural domain, the alphabeta/betaalpha fold of class B beta-lactamases: zinc beta-lactamases, glyoxalases II, and A-type flavoproteins. A detailed inspection of their superimposed structures was undertaken and showed that although these proteins contain binuclear metal sites in spatially equivalent positions, there are some subtle differences within the first ligand sphere that determine a distinct composition of metals. Although zinc beta-lactamases contain either a mono or a di-zinc center, the catalytically active form of glyoxalase II contains a mixed iron-zinc binuclear center, whereas A-type flavoproteins contain a di-iron site. These variations on the type of metal site found within a common fold are correlated with the subtle variations in the nature of the ligating amino acid residues and are discussed in terms of the different reactions catalyzed by each of the protein families. Correlation of these observations with sequence data results in the definition of a sequence motif that comprises the possible binuclear metal site ligands in this broad family. The evolution of the proteins sharing this common fold and factors modulating reactivity are also discussed.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus sake as starter culture in dry sausages.
AB  - One hundred and fifty-two strains of Lactobacillus spp and Micrococcus spp, isolated from dry sausages, were screened for inhibitory activity. Two of the strains assayed of the genus Lactobacillus showed bactericidal activity. They were able to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria seeligeri, Listeria innocua, Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus bavaricus. The strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella bradford and Salmonella newlands, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens were resistant. Their antimicrobial activity was due to peptides detectable in the culture broths and inactivated by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Using bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus sake as starter cultures in dry sausages could be promising in the food industry.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of triclosan-impregnated storage boxes against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Shewanella putrefaciens in conditions simulating domestic use.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance has increased over the past decade causing concern for public health. Domestic antimicrobial products containing triclosan (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether), a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, were introduced in 1997 and have become popular among consumers. Cross-resistance to other antibacterial agents has been suggested as a possible consequence of their widespread use. Triclosan-impregnated plastic storage boxes were tested for activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Shewanella putrefaciens in various conditions, including some designed to simulate usual storage conditions. Results showed inhibition up to a factor of 106 of bacteria grown in direct contact with triclosan-impregnated plastic at 30 and 22 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. Triclosan resistance was not found to increase after repeated exposure in triclosan-impregnated boxes. Further investigation into the effect of triclosan-impregnated products on bacteria will increase understanding of domestic antimicrobial products and implications of their overuse.
TI  - Challenge testing of the lactoperoxidase system in pasteurized milk.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the role of lactoperoxidase (LP) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (LP)-enriched ultra-heat treated (UHT) milk after subsequent pasteurization. Milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. Pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees C/15 s and 80 degrees C/15 s to determine the effect of the LP system on the micro-organisms. An active LP system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (KQ) of milks inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees C, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees C, presumably due to virtual inactivation of LP at 80 degrees C. However, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the KQ of milks challenged with Bacillus cereus spores. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the LP system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater KQ of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees C/15 s compared with 80 degrees C/15 s. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Determination of the antibacterial and antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata (Griseb.) Epling].
AB  - The in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV). The viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. The antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects PrV and HSV-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells were observed at the concentrations assayed. The therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for HSV-1 and PrV, respectively. The antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil of M. verticillata was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) technique. Of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. The antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. Results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define the mechanisms of action are warranted.
TI  - New antioxidant and antimicrobial ellagic acid derivatives from Pteleopsis hylodendron.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of two new compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O-glucoside ellagic acid (1) and the pteleoellagic acid derivative (2), from the stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron is reported along with 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (3), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (4) and 3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (5), which were obtained for the first time from this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with the help of spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to have significant antioxidant activity, while compounds 1-4 showed antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Changes in the disintegration properties of some brands of paracetamol tablets inoculated with four bacterial species.
AB  - Four most common brands of paracetamol (4-aceta-midophenol) tablets were examined for the changes in their disintegration properties after inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and incubating for 5 weeks. The disintegration times varied from one brand to the other, reaching maximum values of 72 min., 82 min., 110 min. and 120 min. for S. aureus, B. cereus, P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella aerogenes, respectively. All brands of paracetamol tablets revealed the presence of cotton wool-like fibrils which were seen to be interwoven within the tablets' matrices and these were believed to have caused the higher disintegration times.
TI  - Microbiological status of commercially available medicinal herbal drugs--a screening study.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-eight medicinal herbal drugs obtained from different suppliers were examined for microbial contaminants and for the detectability of pathogenic microorganisms. For this purpose, several microbiological standard parameters (total aerobic mesophilic count, enterobacteria, coliforms, aerobic sporeformers, yeasts and moulds, enterococci, lactobacilli, pseudomonades and aeromades) and selective methods for the detection of indicator microorganisms and pathogens (E. coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC], Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Candida albicans, potentially aflatoxigenic moulds) were applied. The microbial load of the samples varied considerably. While none of the samples contained EHEC, Salmonellae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeriae, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans, four samples were E. coli positive, two samples were presumptively Campylobacter jejuni positive and nine herbal drugs contained a potentially aflatoxigenic mould flora. Further details regarding different viable count classes as well as preparation techniques are discussed.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Rapid detection and identification of bacterial strains by Fourier transform near-infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - The use of Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy and multivariate pattern recognition techniques for the rapid detection and identification of bacterial contamination in liquids was evaluated. The complex biochemical composition of bacteria yields FT-NIR vibrational transitions (overtone and combination bands) that can be used for classification and identification. Bacterial suspensions (Escherichia coli HB101, E. coli ATCC 43888, E. coli 1224, Bacillus amyloliquifaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria innocua) were filtered to harvest the cells and eliminate the matrix, which has a strong NIR signal. FT-NIR measurements were done using a diffuse reflection-integrating sphere. Principal component analysis showed tight clustering of the bacterial strains at the information-rich spectral region of 6000-4000 cm(-1). The method reproducibly distinguished between different E. coli isolates and conclusively identified the relationship between a new isolate and one of the test species. This methodology may allow for the rapid assessment of potential bacterial contamination in liquids with minimal sample preparation.
TI  - [Effect of increased pressure and changed gaseous media on biological properties  of microorganisms].
AB  - Bacterial contamination of diving outfit and inner surfaces of pressure complex increases at the expense of expansion of gram-negative microflora during long exploitation of undersea complexes. Gram-negative bacteria were hypothesized to effectively adapt to hyperbaric conditions. We investigated the effect of hyperbaric conditions and changed gaseous environment on the cultural and morphological characteristics of colonies, growth rate and time of generation of test cultures (P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, E. coli Tg1, and Bac. subtilis GB2036). Phenotypically modified clones were selected for subsequent analysis of changes at a genetic level. Experiments revealed no essential changes in the studied properties under the effect of extreme conditions.
TI  - Isolation and identification of bacteria associated with adult laboratory Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae).
AB  - From the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Vibrionaceae, Micrococcaceae, Deinococcacea, Bacillaceae, and the genus Listeria. Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with Citrobacter, Streptococcus, Aerococcus, and Listeria found less frequently. We found Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. We also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as Enterobacter cloacae, E. sakazakii, K. pneumoniae spp., Providencia rettgeri, P. aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus. Isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). Antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.
TI  - Synthesis and biological studies of some benzopyran.
AB  - 3-Chlorobenzopyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole (2) was prepared and reacted with sodium azide to give compound 3, whereas its reaction with benzoyl hydrazide, ethyl glycinate, anthranilic acid or o-phenylenediamine afforded the products 4-7, respectively. Compounds 8 and 9 were synthesized by the reaction of compound 2 with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole or piperidine. 3-Hydrazinobenzopyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole (10) was obtained and subjected to cyclization with different reagents such as CS2, benzoic acid, acetyl acetone and diethyl malonate to give compounds 11-14, respectively. Compound 10 was cyclized also with phenacyl cyanide, ylidenemalononitriles to afford the products 15-20, respectively. On the other hand, compound 10 was cyclized with 3-[bis(methylthio)methylene]pentane-2,4-dione or 1,1-dicyano 2,2-dimethylthioethylene to give the corresponding compounds 22 and 23 which in turn were reacted with some compounds containing active methylene groups to afford the corresponding compounds 24-27, respectively. The biological activities of someselected compounds were given.
TI  - Growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports from Europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on Day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. To assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) CFU/mL) by day of storage. RESULTS: All examples of B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL by Day 3 after inoculation. By Day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) CFU per mL. Units contaminated with S. epidermidis showed slower and more varied growth. By Day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) CFU per mL. By Day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL. CONCLUSION: These experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) CFU per mL on Day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. It would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of bacteria and HIV in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates (BC PCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: BC PCs in 35% CPD plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (PAS III) were exposed to photochemical treatment (PCT) with 150 microM of the psoralen S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA, 320-400 nm). Platelet function was evaluated following PCT using a panel of in vitro assays. RESULTS: This PCT process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens). No viable bacteria were detected following PCT and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control BC PCs. Complete inactivation of the gram-positive Bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with BC PCs. PCT was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 in BC PCs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (TCID(50)/ml) of cell-associated HIV-1. Rapid inactivation was observed with increasing UVA doses: with 150 microM S-59 and a 1 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA. No physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control BC PCs during 7 days of storage. CONCLUSION: PCT with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) UVA treatment does not adversely affect in vitro properties of BC PCs stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. The PCT process inactivated bacteria and HIV-1 inoculated into the BC PCs. These results extend the earlier reported efficacy of PCT apheresis PCs to BC PCs.
TI  - Kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. The pH decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the OD of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. The counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. The antimicrobial activity of Kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacterpylori, and Listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to Kombucha. According to the literature on Kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and this is also valid in the present study. However, in this study, Kombucha proved to exert antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Sh. sonnei, Sal. typhimurium, Sal. enteritidis, and Cm. jejuni, even at neutral pH and after thermal denaturation. This finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in Kombucha.
TI  - Biological screening of Brazilian medicinal plants.
AB  - In this study, we screened sixty medicinal plant species from the Brazilian savanna ("cerrado") that could contain useful compounds for the control of tropical diseases. The plant selection was based on existing ethnobotanic information and interviews with local healers. Plant extracts were screened for: (a) molluscicidal activity against Biomphalaria glabrata, (b) toxicity to brine shrimp (Artemia salina L.), (c) antifungal activity in the bioautographic assay with Cladosporium sphaerospermum and (d) antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Forty-two species afforded extracts that showed some degree of activity in one or more of these bioassays.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Characterization of VIM-2, a carbapenem-hydrolyzing metallo-beta-lactamase and its plasmid- and integron-borne gene from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate in France.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa COL-1 was identified in a blood culture of a 39-year-old-woman treated with imipenem in Marseilles, France, in 1996. This strain was resistant to beta-lactams, including ureidopenicillins, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and meropenem, but remained susceptible to the monobactam aztreonam. The carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase gene of P. aeruginosa COL-1 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli DH10B. The deduced 266-amino-acid protein was an Ambler class B beta-lactamase, with amino acid identities of 32% with B-II from Bacillus cereus; 31% with IMP-1 from several gram-negative rods in Japan, including P. aeruginosa; 27% with CcrA from Bacteroides fragilis; 24% with BlaB from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum; 24% with IND-1 from Chryseobacterium indologenes; 21% with CphA-1 from Aeromonas hydrophila; and 11% with L-1 from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. It was most closely related to VIM-1 beta-lactamase recently reported from Italian P. aeruginosa clinical isolates (90% amino acid identity). Purified VIM-2 beta-lactamase had a pI of 5.6, a relative molecular mass of 29.7 kDa, and a broad substrate hydrolysis range, including penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamycins, oxacephamycins, and carbapenems, but not monobactams. As a metallo-beta-lactamase, its activity was zinc dependent and inhibited by EDTA (50% inhibitory concentration, 50 microM). VIM-2 conferred a resistance pattern to beta-lactams in E. coli DH10B that paralleled its in vitro hydrolytic properties, except for susceptibility to ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, and cefepime. bla(VIM-2) was located on a ca. 45-kb plasmid that in addition conferred resistance to sulfamides and that was not self-transmissible either from P. aeruginosa to E. coli or from E. coli to E. coli. bla(VIM-2) was the only gene cassette located within the variable region of a novel class 1 integron, In56, that was weakly related to the bla(VIM-1)-containing integron. VIM-2 is the second carbapenem-hydrolyzing metalloenzyme characterized from a P. aeruginosa isolate outside Japan.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of J-111,225, a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem, against transferable IMP-1 metallo-beta-lactamase producers.
AB  - IMP-1 beta-lactamase, a class B zinc metallo-enzyme encoded by the transferable bla(IMP) gene, is known to confer high-level resistance to carbapenems as well as to penicillins and cephalosporins. J-111, 225 is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with a structurally unique side chain comprising a trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio moiety at the C2 position. It inhibited 17 Serratia marcescens and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa IMP-1-producing clinical isolates at a concentration of 32 mg/L (range 4-32 mg/L). It showed synergy with imipenem against IMP-1-producing S. marcescens BB5886 and P. aeruginosa GN17203 with minimal FIC indices of 0.38 and 0.5, respectively. J-111,225 was more resistant than imipenem to hydrolysis by class B metallo-beta-lactamases. In kinetic studies, J-111,225 inhibited the IMP-I enzyme with a K(i) of 0.18 microM when imipenem was used as a substrate. In contrast, J-111,225 was the substrate for hydrolysis by other class B beta-lactamases such as Bacteroides fragilis CcrA, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia L1 and Bacillus cereus type II enzyme with respective K(m) values of 11, 10 and 148 microM. The greater antibacterial activity of J-111,225 against IMP-1-producing bacteria may result from its unique interaction with the beta-lactamase.
TI  - Aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical S-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after one or two doses 12 hours apart. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between February 1997 and June 1997 at the UIC Eye Center. METHODS: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). RESULTS: Group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. Group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous MIC90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), Bacillus cereus (vitreous), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. Mean MIC90 levels were obtained in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of turmeric oil: a byproduct from curcumin manufacture.
AB  - Curcumin, the yellow color pigment of turmeric, is produced industrially from turmeric oleoresin. The mother liquor after isolation of curcumin from oleoresin contains approximately 40% oil. The oil was extracted from the mother liquor using hexane at 60 degrees C, and the hexane extract was separated into three fractions using silica gel column chromatography. These fractions were tested for antibacterial activity by pour plate method against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fraction II eluted with 5% ethyl acetate in hexane was found to be most active fraction. The turmeric oil, fraction I, and fraction II were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. ar-Turmerone, turmerone, and curlone were found to be the major compounds present in these fractions along with other oxygenated compounds.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of several parts of Pinus brutia, Juniperus oxycedrus, Abies cilicia, Cedrus libani and Pinus nigra.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. Chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of Pinus brutia Ten., Juniperus oxycedrus L., Abies cilicia Ant. & Kotschy Carr., Cedrus libani A. Rich. and Pinus nigra Arn. were prepared and tested against Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Bacillus cereus FMC 19, Escherichia coli DM, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 3, Enterobacter aerogenes CCM 2531, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Proteus vulgaris FMC 1, Listeria monocytogenes Scoot A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 5007, Candida albicans CCM 314, Candida tropicalis MDC 86 and Penicillium italicum K. The results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, E. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of A. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. All the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. When the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. On the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of Juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
TI  - Decontamination of human sclera: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The human sclera is frequently used in ophthalmic surgeries and must be  preserved in disinfectants that prevent its contamination. In this study the efficiency of glycerin, absolute alcohol (ethanol), and benzalkonium chloride (1:5,000) as human sclera disinfectants were compared. METHODS: Fresh human scleras were trephined, the scleral disks divided into three groups and contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), or Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) for 24 h. Thereafter they were transferred to preservation vials each containing glycerin, absolute alcohol, benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000) or Trypticase Soy Broth (control), respectively, and stored at room temperature. From each vial, two scleral disks were removed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days of immersion. Both were plated on blood agar, one being macerated, and both incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and B. cereus were recovered from the glycerin-immersed scleral disks until the second, fourth, and fourteenth days, respectively. Bacillus cereus was recovered from those immersed in absolute alcohol until the fourteenth day, whereas disks infected with the other microorganisms and immersed in absolute alcohol presented no growth since the very first day of immersion. Bacillus cereus was recovered from scleral disks immersed in benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000) only on the first day. CONCLUSION: Resistant microorganisms can survive in scleral tissue preserved in glycerin and absolute alcohol. We conclude that benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000) in vitro is the best disinfectant for human sclera after 24 h.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of blaVIM, a new integron-borne metallo-beta-lactamase gene from a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate.
AB  - Production of a metallo-beta-lactamase activity was detected in a carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate (isolate VR-143/97) from an Italian inpatient at the Verona University Hospital (northern Italy). The metallo-beta-lactamase determinant was isolated from a genomic library of VR-143/97, constructed in an Escherichia coli plasmid vector, by screening for clones with reduced susceptibility to imipenem. Sequencing of the cloned gene revealed that it encoded a new class B beta-lactamase that was named VIM-1. At the sequence level VIM-1 was rather divergent from the other class B enzymes (16.4 to 38.7% identity), overall being more similar to members of subclass B1 including the beta-lactamase II of Bacillus cereus (Bc-II), the Bacteroides fragilis CcrA, the Chryseobacterium meningosepticum BlaB, and the cassette-encoded IMP-1 enzymes. Among these, VIM-1 showed the highest degree of similarity to Bc-II. Similarly to blaIMP, blaVIM was also found to be carried on a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron. The blaVIM-containing integron was located on the chromosome of P. aeruginosa VR-143/97, and the metallo-beta-lactamase-encoding determinant was not transferable to E. coli by conjugation. Expression of the integron-borne blaVIM gene in E. coli resulted in a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefepime, and carbapenems), revealing a very broad substrate specificity of the VIM-1 enzyme.
TI  - Pulsed-light inactivation of food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The effects of high-intensity pulsed-light emissions of high or low UV content on the survival of predetermined populations of Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were investigated. Bacterial cultures were seeded separately on the surface of tryptone soya-yeast extract agar and were reduced by up to 2 or 6 log10 orders with 200 light pulses (pulse duration, approximately 100 ns) of low or high UV content, respectively (P < 0.001).
TI  - Synergist effect of sucrose fatty acid esters on nisin inhibition of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Nisin in combination with the sucrose fatty acid esters, sucrose palmitate (P-1570 and P-1670) or sucrose stearate (S-1570 and S-1670) was tested against a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Initial liquid culture investigation showed that the sugar ester P-1670 resulted in a synergist enhancement of the bacteriostatic activity of nisin against Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram-negative bacteria. Some enhancement of the bactericidal activity of nisin against Listeria monocytogenes was also observed. This increased nisin inhibitory effect was confirmed on solid media using plates with gradients of pH and NaCl. Synergism was observed with all four sucrose fatty acid esters, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity of nisin against several strains of L. monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus (both cells and spores), Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus. The combination of nisin and the sucrose fatty acid esters showed no inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enteritidis, Salm. typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
TI  - Amino-acid sequence and three-dimensional structure of the Staphylococcus aureus  metalloproteinase at 1.72 A resolution.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aureolysin is an extracellular zinc-dependent metalloproteinase from  the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This enzyme exhibits in vitro activity against several molecules of biological significance for the host, indicating that it is involved in the pathology of staphylococcal diseases. RESULTS: Here we report the amino-acid sequence and inhibitor-free X-ray crystal structure of aureolysin, a member of the thermolysin family of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases. This enzyme, which binds one zinc and three calcium ions, comprises a single chain of 301 amino acids that consists of a beta-strand-rich upper domain and an alpha-helix-rich lower domain. CONCLUSIONS: The overall structure of aureolysin is very similar to that of the other three members of this family whose structures are known - thermolysin (TLN) from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, neutral protease (NP) from Bacillus cereus and elastase (PAE) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. But an important difference has been encountered: in contrast to what has been observed in the other three members of this family (TLN, NP and PAE), inhibitor-free aureolysin displays a 'closed' active site cleft conformation. This new structure therefore raises questions about the universality of the hinge-bending motion model for the neutral metalloproteinases.
TI  - Involvement of a rhamnolipid-producing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by a bacterial community.
AB  - A rhamnolipid-producing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa GL1 was isolated from a  bacterial community growing on a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as sole carbon source. Strain GL1 did not grow on PAH but grew on known degradation metabolites of phenanthrene (O-phthalic acid) and of naphthalene (salicylic acid). In co-culture with a phenanthrene-degrading strain, Ps. aeruginosa GL1 accelerated the degradation of phenanthrene. Strain GL1 was resistant to toxic amphiphilic compounds such as cationic and anionic detergents. Rhamnolipid production took place in a late stage growth in cultures of strain GL1 on glycerol or n-hexadecane. It coincided with a substantial decrease in cell hydrophobicity and with morphological changes of the outer membrane as observed by transmission electronic microscopy. The rhamnolipids produced inhibited the growth of bacteria such as Rhodococcus erythropolis, Bacillus cereus and Ps. fluorescens. The overall results suggested an outer membrane origin for the rhamnolipids. They also indicate that the utilization of PAH metabolites by strain GL1 is important for the stability of the PAH-degrading community.
TI  - Insights into the mechanism of catalysis by the P-C bond-cleaving enzyme phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase derived from gene sequence analysis and mutagenesis.
AB  - Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (phosphonatase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphonoacetaldehyde to acetaldehyde and inorganic phosphate. In this study, the genes encoding phosphonatase in Bacillus cereus and in Salmonella typhimurium were cloned for high-level expression in Escherichia coli. The kinetic properties of the purified, recombinant phosphonatases were determined. The Schiff base mechanism known to operate in the B. cereus enzyme was verified for the S. typhimurium enzyme by phosphonoacetaldehyde-sodium borohydride-induced inactivation and by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic lysine 53. The protein sequence inferred from the B. cereus phosphonatase gene was determined, and this sequence was used along with that from the S. typhimurium phosphonatase gene sequence to search the primary sequence databases for possible structural homologues. We found that phosphonatase belongs to a novel family of hydrolases which appear to use a highly conserved active site aspartate residue in covalent catalysis. On the basis of this finding and the known stereochemical course of phosphonatase-catalyzed hydrolysis at phosphorus (retention), we propose a mechanism which involves Schiff base formation with lysine 53 followed by phosphoryl transfer to aspartate (at position 11 in the S. typhimurium enzyme and position 12 in the B. cereusphosphonatase) and last hydrolysis at the imine C(1) and acyl phosphate phosphorus.
TI  - Antibacterial and chemical evaluation of Chromolaena moritziana.
AB  - Chromolaena moritziana (Sch. Bip. ex Hieron.) King & Robin. (Asteraceae) is used  in local ethnomedicine as an anticatarrhal, a depurative and in the treatment of skin diseases. This ethnopharmacological information has a direct correlation with that reported for other Chromolaena species. Dichloromethane and aqueous extracts from the leaves as well as ethyl acetate extracts from the flowers have shown antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and a UV-V light effect was not observed against this bacterium. These results may justify the ethnomedical use in skin infections. The flavonoids kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, rutin and isoquercitrin as well as the triterpene alpha-amyrin were isolated.
TI  - [Combined effect of temperature a(W) and pH on proteases from Pseudomonas and Bacillus spp].
AB  - The factors affecting protease activity were investigated on certain media. Five  strains of Bacillus (B.) cereus, four strains of B. subtilis, five strains of Pseudomonas (Ps.) aeruginosa and two strains of Ps. fluorescens produced the proteases that were tested. The enzyme activity was evaluated under 32 different combinations of temperature (2 and 7 degrees C), water activity (aw) (0.80-0.98) and pH (4.0-7.3). A decrease in water activity and pH and/or temperature caused a decrease in protease activity. It appeared that the combined effect of temperature, aw and pH influences enzyme production significantly compared with the influence of single environmental factors. Temperature plays the crucial role in these reactions. Enzyme activities could be observed even at low temperature. Although the exoprotease of Ps. spp. showed intense activity at refrigeration temperature, low pH and aw, Bacillus proteases were comparably less active under the same conditions, but nevertheless proved to be significant.
TI  - In-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
AB  - The toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. In several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 J/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. Derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
TI  - A xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, Xanthium sibiricum Patr er Widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). By monitoring antibacterial activity against MRSA strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3aR-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2H-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against S. aureus species, including MRSA; its activity against MRSA and MSSA strains was similar. Other bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including Escherichia coli. The results show that xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of S. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.
TI  - Synthesis of some biologically active agents derived from thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives.
AB  - The key compound 1-amino-8-iminocyclopenta[b]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine (5g) was prepared by reaction of 2-amino-3-cyano cyclopenta[b]thiophene (1) with triethyl orthoformate followed by cyclization with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol. Refluxing of 1 with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of acetic anhydride gave an unexpected product 2. while reaction with aromatic amines gave the condensation products 4a-c. Reaction of 5g with formic acid, other formate derivatives, ethoxymethylenemalononitrile and ethyl ethoxymethylenecyanoacetate gave the same product cyclopentathieno-[2,3-d]-1,2,4-triazolo[3,2-f]pyrimidine 6. Compound 7 was prepared by different methods. Treatment of 5g with dicarbonyl compounds gave the triazol derivatives 8-11. Reaction of 5g with phenyl isothiocyanate, carbon disulphide and ethyl chloroformate gave the corresponding derivatives 12-14, respectively. Condensation of 5g with some selected aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes, acetone, N-acetyl isatin and isatin gave the condensation products 15a-e, 16-18, respectively in good yields. Many of the synthesized compounds were tested in vitro for their inhibitory activity against a variety of bacteria such as: Serratia rhodnii, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus citreus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and fungi such as: Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium chrysogenum and Alternaria alternarta. Some compounds showed modest activity.
TI  - Inhibition, reactivation, and determination of metal ions in membrane metalloproteases of bacterial origin using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled on-line with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.
AB  - High-performance liquid chromatography coupled on-line with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) was used for the characterization of metal ions in several metalloproteases of bacterial origin. The different components of the bacterial extracts were separated on a size-exclusion column. The eluent of the HPLC system was continuously transported to the ICP-MS system for rapid, reproducible, and sensitive analyses of trace elements in the metalloproteases. Two different membrane proteases from Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were characterized to be zinc metalloproteases using enzymological methods and HPLC-ICP-MS. The zinc content was determined to be three molecules of zinc per protein molecule for the B. cereus protease and one molecule of zinc per protein molecule for the P. aeruginosa protease. For another purified protease, a periplasmic alanyl aminopeptidase of P. aeruginosa, the lack of protein-bound metal ions could be clearly determined-a confirmation that this main aminopeptidase of P. aeruginosa belongs to the cysteine protease family. The presence of nonionic detergents can influence the distribution of trace elements during the HPLC separation. Therefore, the use of these substances should be avoided during enzyme purification for metal analyses or they should be exchanged later for zwitterionic and ionic detergents with more strongly dissociating properties.
TI  - A study of photobactericidal activity in the phenothiazinium series.
AB  - The photodynamic antibacterial properties of a closely related series of commercially available phenothiazinium dyes were tested against a range of pathogenic strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The photosensitisers were illuminated using a non-laser light source at a fluence of 1.75 mW cm-2 and this resulted in the enhancement of antibacterial activity in liquid culture. In several cases, illumination resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal concentrations required, giving up to 100-fold increases in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Acquired carbapenemases.

TI  - Antibacterial effect of the adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The spent culture supernatant of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. It decreased the in vitro viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. The antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. Activity against S. typhimurium SL1344 infecting human cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional C3H/He/oujco mouse model with S. typhimurium C5 infection and oral treatment with the LB spent culture supernatant.
TI  - Sterilisation of surgical instruments with formaldehyde gas.
AB  - Haemostatic forceps contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Aspergillus flavus were exposed to formaldehyde gas for up to 48 hours at different temperatures and relative humidities. After 24 hours at 22 to 24 degrees C and a relative humidity of 73 per cent they were sterilised reliably and completely.

TI  - Role of hemolytic and nonhemolytic phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for inflammatory mediator release from human granulocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa phospholipase C (PLC) is a critical component  in the pathogenesis of severe P. aeruginosa infections. However, P. aeruginosa can produce a hemolytic (PLC-H) as well as a nonhemolytic (PLC-N) variant, both having a MW of about 77 kD. In the past, studies did not distinguish between both types of PLC with regard to the induction of inflammatory mediators from human cells. METHODS: We compared the ability of P. aeruginosa PLC-H and PLC-N to generate leukotriene B4 (by HPLC) and oxygen (O2-) metabolites (luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence), and to release beta-glucuronidase and histamine (fluorophotometry from human granulocytes. Therefore, human neutrophilic granulocytes (PMN; 1 x 10(7)) or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (5 x 10(6)) were treated with purified P. aeruginosa PLC-H (up to 10 units) as well as culture supernatants (cutoff: MW > 50,000) of P. aeruginosa PAOl capable of producing both PLC-H and PLC-N, and PAOl mutant strains deficient in the production of either or both phospholipases. Controls were PLC-H from Clostridium perfringens and PLC-N from Bacillus cereus. RESULTS: PLC-H-containing P. aeruginosa culture supernatant, purified P. aeruginosa PLC-H as well as PLC-H from P. perfringens activated human leukocytes for a significant (p < 0.05) increase in inflammatory mediator release. In this regard, purified PLC-H (10 units) from P. aeruginosa activated human PMN for a significant increase in the generation of oxygen metabolites (30 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cpm) and in leukotriene B4 (6.1 +/- 2.0 ng), in the release of beta-glucuronidase (15.8 +/- 1.1%) and of histamine (25.8 +/- 6.2%) as compared to the corresponding control values (3 +/- 1 x 10(3) cpm; 0.2 +/- 0.1 ng; 5.1 +/- 1.0%, 5.1 +/- 1.5%). Culture supernatants containing no PLC or only PLC-N, as well as PLC-N from B. cereus, failed to activate or only slightly stimulated human granulocytes for inflammatory mediator release. CONCLUSION: The data thus provide evidence that P. aeruginosa PLC-H can be a potent inducer of inflammatory mediator release, at least in vitro. Our results therefore contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological role of P. aeruginosa PLCs.
TI  - Methods for increasing survivability during storage of exponentially growing bacteria.
AB  - A protocol has been developed for storing Gram (-) bacterial cells at 0 degrees C, which allows greater than 90% of stored cells to retain colony-forming ability for up to 60 days. The protocol, which yields essentially identical results when used with Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, does not enhance survivability of Bacillus cereus. The greatest and longest survival is enjoyed when exponentially growing cells in minimal-glucose medium are deprived of carbon for about 9 h, supplemented with 750 microg/ml chloramphenicol, and immediately placed at 0 degrees C. By decreasing the period of carbon starvation from 9 to 5 h, or increasing the period of carbon starvation from 9 to 12 h, both the ultimate survival rate and kinetics of loss of culturability are affected. Survival enhancement induced by chloramphenicol is not similarly induced by kanamycin.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptomyces strains isolated from soils in two landfill areas in north Jordan.
AB  - A total of 114 Streptomyces strains were isolated and purified from soils collected from Al Akider (53) and from Al Kafeer (61) landfill areas in north Jordan. The Al Akider strains were classified into 5 colour series gray (27), white (18), yellow (3), violet (3) and green (2); while the Al Kafeer strains were classified into 6 colour series white (26), gray (16), yellow (9), red (2), green (7) and blue (1). Melanin pigment was produced by 21 and 25% of the Al Akider and Al Kafeer strains, respectively, while soluble pigment was produced by 15% of the A; Akider and 21% of the Al Kafeer strains; 17% of Al Akider strains and 23% of Al Kafeer strains showed distinctive reverse side pigment. Forty, 32, 19, and 9% of the Al Akider strains had spiral, rectus, flexous and retinaculum apertum spore-chains, respectively, while the distribution of the Al Kafeer strains in the same spore-chain forms was equally 25% each. Arabinose, xylose, inositol, fructose, rhamnose, sucrose, raffinose, and mannitol were utilized by 91, 53, 89, 60, 30, 25 and 79% of the Al Akider strains and by 84, 59, 62, 64, 70, 75, 41 and 26% of the Al Kafeer strains, respectively, while only 2% of the Al Kafeer strains were found to utilize cellulose. Thirty-six percent of the Al Akider strains showed, in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus followed by Aspergillus niger (26%), Bacillus cereus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25% each), Fusarium monilliforme (21%), Candida albicans (15%), Escherichia coli (8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), while 51, 49, 46, 34, 25, 15, 7 and 2% of the Al Kafeer strains exhibited activity against A. niger, S. cerevisiae, B. cereus, S. aureus, F. monilliforme, C. albicans, P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Helichrysum aureonitens (Asteraceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts from Helichrysum aureonitens was investigated. The dichloromethane extract was active against all five gram positive bacteria tested and the methanol extract was active only against Bacillus cereus, B. pumilus and Micrococcus kristinae, while the water extract had no activity against any of the organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of the five gram negative bacteria tested.
TI  - Studies on microbial aerobic flora of skin in leprosy patients.
AB  - This study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. These include 56 paucibacillary (PB) and 73 multibacillary (MB) cases. Thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. The non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically PB leprosy (TT/BT/I) patients were: (1) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus(1), Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Bacillus subtilis(1), Corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(1), Proteus mirabilis(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). The isolates from clinically MB leprosy (BB/BL/LL) patients were: (a) Gram-positive cocci: Micrococci(1), Staphylococcus aureus(1) and Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1); Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1). (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Proteus mirabilis(2). The specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. These were (a) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus albus(2), Staphylococcus aureus(2) and Micrococci(2); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1), Bacillus subtilis(2), Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(3), Proteus vulgaris(1) and Proteus mirabilis(1). While these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and PB/MB types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out subtypes if any.
TI  - An antibacterial vitamin E derivative from Tovomitopsis psychotriifolia.
AB  - The crude ethanol extract from the leaves of Tovomitopsis psychotriifolia (Clusiaceae) exhibits antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The biologically active agent in the extract has been isolated by chromatographic techniques and identified by NMR spectroscopy as trans-delta-tocotrienoloic acid.
TI  - Antimicrobial mode of action of secretions from the metapleural gland of Myrmecia gulosa (Australian bull ant).
AB  - Secretions from exocrine metapleural glands of Myrmecia gulosa (Australian bull ant) exhibit broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Treatment of the yeast Candida albicans with metapleural secretion resulted in the rapid and total leakage of K+ ions from cells within 10 min. Ultrastructural analysis of the bacteria Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and cells and protoplasts of Candida albicans demonstrated gross damage of the cell membrane and aggregation of the cytoplasmic matrix of treated cells. Degradation of membrane-bound organelles was also observed in Candida albicans. The antimicrobially active components of metapleural secretions were nonpolar and interacted with the phospholipid bilayer, causing damage to the structural integrity of liposomes and the release of carboxyfluorescein. The data suggest that the antimicrobial agents in metapleural secretion act primarily by disrupting the structure and function of the phospholipid bilayer of the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Microbial counts and characteristics of Streptoverticillium strains isolated from soils in the Jordan valley.
AB  - A microbial survey of total bacterial count, agrobacteria, streptomycetes, and fungi was carried out in six locations in the Jordan Valley. The highest microbial counts for the four populations were in spring, the lowest mostly in autumn. No significant differences at p < 0.05 were observed either in the counts between the six locations, or in the seasonal counts of agrobacteria and streptomycetes between the six locations as well as within each location. The total bacterial counts (at p < 0.01) and fungi (at p < 0.05) differed significantly in the six locations. Microbial counts and the studied environmental conditions showed no significant regression. Of 552 streptomycetes strains isolated from soils collected from these locations, 58 belonged to the genus Streptoverticillium. They were distributed in five colour series grey (41%), red (31%), green (17%), blue (7%) and white (3%). Forty-eight strains had biverticillium spore bearing hyphae while only 10 had monoverticillium. While 28 strains produced distinctive reverse side pigment, only 8 and 6 strains produced soluble pigment and melanin pigment, respectively. Most strains utilized arabinose followed by fructose, mannitol, rhamnose, xylose, sucrose, inositol, and raffinose. Sixty-nine per cent of the strains exhibited activity in vitro test against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 45, 41, 28, and 7% against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Escherichia coli, respectively.

TI  - Inhibition of spoilage and food-borne pathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated  from fermenting tef (Eragrostis tef) dough.
AB  - A study was carried out at the Department of Biology, Addis Abeba University, in  1991 to determine the inhibitory potential of fermenting tef and the lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermenting tef dough on Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. The test bacteria grew in the fermenting tef uptill 30 hr or till the pH dropped to 4.7. Thereafter, growth was inhibited and decreases in population were apparent. The results showed that the spent media from all of the four lactic acid bacterial isolates, namely, Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp. and Streptococcus spp. inhibited the test bacteria. Acidity on its own was not responsible for the inhibition of the test bacteria. The spent medium from Streptococcus spp. showed the best inhibitory activity amongst the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Anti-bacterial antibodies in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed oligoclonal B-cell lines established from normal persons and autoimmune disease patients.
AB  - We have established 950 and 430 oligoclonal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from two normal persons and eight autoimmune disease patients, respectively by using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced transformation. To re-evaluate the EBV technique for production of human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) related to infectious disease, we screened these oligoclonal LCLs for antibodies against 31 bacterial strains systematically. A total of 74 cultures out of 1380 were reactive to a total of 18 strains out of 31. Among these, eight cultures showed 10(-3) antibody (Ab) titers to Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotypes C, E, F and I, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens and Bacillus cereus. Ten cultures showed 10(-2) Ab titers to Ps. aeruginosa serotypes D, E, F and I, Ps. maltophilia, Staph. epidermidis, Klebsiella ozaenae, Ser. marcescens and B. subtilis. The results reveal the further possibilities for the EBV technique to produce various infectious disease-related human mAbs.
TI  - Platelet bacterial contamination and the use of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial ribosomal RNA gene probe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the maximum outdate for platelets is 5 days, because of the increasing chance of bacterial growth over time. Various methods for rapid detection of bacterial contamination of blood components have been described, with mixed results and no general acceptance. A recently described, molecular biologic approach for the detection of bacterial contamination involves a chemiluminescence-linked universal DNA bacterial probe to a highly conserved bacterial region of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicenter trial of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial rRNA probe for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates is described. At each of five sites, platelet concentrates (no older than 1 day from date of phlebotomy) were inoculated in triplicate with isolates of four bacterial species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus) to a final concentration of 10 to 50 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL and in triplicate to a final concentration of 1000 CFUs per mL. At one site, an additional 6 platelet concentrates were inoculated with sterile saline to serve as controls. Inoculated units were then subjected periodically to quantitative cultures and probe analyses. A total of 126 platelet concentrates were studied over a period of 7 days (120 inoculated with bacteria and 6 with sterile saline). RESULTS: This assay was, in some cases, able to detect S. aureus bacterial contamination in the range of 100 to 1000 CFUs per mL; the majority of samples (B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis) with contamination exceeding 10(4) CFUs per mL; and all samples with contamination of 2.1 x 10(5) CFUs per mL or greater. Increasing the sample size from the recommended 0.4 mL to 1.0 mL resulted in an unacceptable loss of specificity (83.3%). CONCLUSION: The routine use of this assay would be expected to result in a decreased risk of septic platelet transfusion reactions and could lead to a lengthening of the current 5 day storage period for platelets. Further, the pooling of random-donor platelet concentrates before storage instead of immediately before transfusion may be possible if this rRNA probe is employed to detect bacteria in the pool.
TI  - Survival and growth of selected pathogens in fermented kocho (Ensete ventricosum).
AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the antagonistic potential of fermented kocho, aqueous extract of fermented kocho and spent media from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from it on Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Fermented kocho (pH 4.3) inhibited growth of the test bacteria soon after their introduction into the food. The spent media from all of the four LAB, isolated from fermented kocho, namely Pediococcus sp, Leuconostoc sp, Lactobacillus sp and Streptococcus sp prevented the survival and growth of the test bacteria. The spent medium from Streptococcus sp showed the best antagonistic effect amongst all the LAB isolates. In all cases the inhibitory effects were independent of pH.
TI  - Modes of inhibition of foodborne non-Salmonella bacteria by selenite cystine selective broth.
AB  - Various cell densities of six common foodborne non-Salmonella bacteria were exposed to selenite cystine (SC) Salmonella selective medium. The insensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris to SC was confirmed. Selenite cystine selective medium was effective against the sensitive bacteria up to certain cell densities, beyond which the bacteria survived. As judged from the minimum cell number required for survival in SC, Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive to SC, followed by Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii. When sensitive bacteria were grown in SC, they enriched resistant variants which exhibited no or reduced sensitivity to SC. The change in density of sensitive cells after exposure to SC suggested that bacterial sensitivity to SC depended on the efficiency of killing and growth inhibition by SC as well as the fraction of resistant variants in the bacterial population. Since Salmonella samples generally contain unknown numbers and types of sensitive bacteria, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of their selective inhibition by SC.
TI  - Responses of diverse heterotrophic bacteria to elevated copper concentrations.
AB  - The influence of copper on the growth of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyticus (three strains), and an unidentified Vibrio sp. was examined in batch cultures. The effects of copper at micromolar concentrations varied from undetectable to complete growth inhibition. Each strain was able to recover from a growth lag observed after copper addition at a characteristic concentration. Copper concentrations that allowed recovery ranged from 25 to 150 microM. Extracellular proteins in the medium of cultures that had recovered from copper stress were compared with those from control cultures. Protein profiles were analyzed for the presence of proteins similar to extracellular copper-binding proteins (CuBP) previously reported in V. alginolyticus. CuBP-like proteins were found in each Vibrio sp. examined. A protein of similar molecular mass was also detected in copper-stressed cultures of P. aeruginosa and not in control cultures. Escherichia coli and Bacillus spp. did not produce CuBP-like proteins. The data show that CuBP-like proteins are not produced by all bacteria in response to copper stress and indicate that such proteins are common in marine Vibrio spp.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of platelets at a university hospital: increased identification due to intensified surveillance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cluster of bacterial contamination of platelets occurred at a university hospital in a one-month period. This unusual clustering allowed us to examine the likely mechanism of contamination and clinical sequelae. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of patients receiving random donor platelet transfusions to determine numbers of platelets transfused, reactions reported, and episodes of bacterial contamination. We also reviewed procedures at the collecting blood agencies and the hospital blood bank. RESULTS: Four patients received bacterially contaminated platelets during June and July 1991. The rates of reported platelet transfusion reactions increased significantly (P < 0.001) from September 1989 through July 1991 (study period); in addition, the rate of contamination of platelets during June and July 1991 was 23-fold higher than during the previous 21 months (P < 0.001). Surveillance methodology changed dramatically during the study period, contributing to the recognition of the current cluster. Pathogens isolated from the contaminated platelet pools were Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in titers ranging from 10(6) to 10(8) colony forming units/mL. Four constituent individual platelet units identified as the probable cause of the outbreak (including one postepidemic episode) were significantly older (mean age, 4.8 days) than 106 randomly selected individual platelet units (mean age, 3.7 days; P = 0.04). Platelet pools were transfused an average of 2.5 hours after pooling. Review of blood collection and platelet preparation practices did not identify breaks in procedure or technique that could have caused contamination. CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness of platelet transfusion reactions by clinical staff and routine culturing of all platelets associated with transfusion reactions will identify contaminated platelets. Identification of contaminated platelets is necessary to treat affected patients appropriately and to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for contaminated platelets (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 1994;15:82-87).
TI  - Novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  - The recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (PC) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (BacT/Alert) with two traditional methods. Full-scale experiments were performed with a total of 33 units of PC (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. Six strains known as possible PC contaminants were tested: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, E. aerogenes, and S. sanguis. Using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml, bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 PCs on 132 sampling occasions. With a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all PCs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. All of 11 uninoculated PC controls were negative. With the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive PC was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two manual-visual systems. The new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. This would increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.
TI  - Studies of one invasive and two noninvasive methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates.
AB  - Recently, a new method for noninvasive detection of bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates was described [Arpi et al.: Vox Sang 1993;65:335-336]. A CO2-sensitive label is applied on the outer surface of the plastic container of the platelet concentrate. When any contaminating bacteria have increased the pCO2 to a certain level the label changes color, indicating bacterial growth. We have studied this technique and applied such sensitive labels both directly onto PCs and onto plastic bags with culture medium into which platelet contents have been transferred. However, in both cases the sensitivity of the technique was found insufficient for practical quality control of PCs. There seem to be two problems with this principle: (1) platelets produce CO2 and (2) a considerable amount of the gas passes beside the detection label, in this way decreasing the sensitivity of detection by the label. This noninvasive technique was compared with an invasive method using automated bacterial culture, which was found sensitive and rapid.

AB  - Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus laterosporus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. The effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
TI  - Phase separation of nonionic detergents by salt addition and its application to membrane proteins.
AB  - By adding salts (sodium chloride, ammonium sulfate), it is possible to induce phase separation in membrane-protein solubilisates containing Triton X-100 or Nonidet P-40 at temperatures between 0 and 20 degrees C. Other nonionic detergents of the Brij, Lubrol, and Tween series can also be used for this procedure. The salt concentration required for induction of phase separation is dependent on the hydrophobicity of the detergent used. For detergents of the Triton series it seems that detergents with lower hydrophilic lipophilic balance numbers need lower salt concentrations to separate the phases than those with larger hydrophilic parts. Ammonium sulfate precipitation as an initial purification step for membrane proteins should be avoided in the presence of the nonionic detergents tested. Instead of this procedure, phase separation induced by sodium chloride or ammonium sulfate can be recommended, as was proved for membrane-bound proteases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and for bacteriorhodopsin.
TI  - The penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  - We examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. We obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. These vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the MIC70 of S. aureus and Bacillus cereus. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Detection by in vitro amplification of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) gene from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus is described for the specific amplification of the phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) gene of Clostridium perfringens. A set of primers selected for their high specificity could detect Cl. perfringens in stools with a detection limit of approximately 5 x 10(2) bacteria, after bi-amplification. A modified PCR without thermal steps was performed to rapidly amplify, with a yield of 60%, the DNA template. With this PCR method Cl. perfringens alpha-toxin gene could be detected within 2 h. The PCR method detected alpha-toxin positive Cl. perfringens but did not react with phospholipase C-producing Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cl. sordellii and Cl. bifermentans. The amplified PCR products were screened through ethidium bromide agarose gel electrophoresis or, in only 1 h, with the PhastSystem (Pharmacia). This PCR satisfies the criteria of specificity, sensitivity and rapidity required for a useful tool in epidemiology and for the diagnosis of the pathogen Cl. perfringens as it may be used directly on stool samples.
TI  - A study of purified pyocyanine produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: properties and grouping.
AB  - A study of more than one thousand strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed. These were collected from different sources, i.e. humans, animals, environment and food. Cumulative results revealed the existence of three different groups of pyocyanine. The biological importance of grouping this pigment is due to its activity against other bacteria in comparison with other antibiotics such as cyanomycin produced by Streptomyces cyanoflavus. No such grouping or any other classification was found in the literature. Stability test and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) measurements revealed the priority of group (I); also isolates of animal origin were found preferable. This may be due to the resistance of strains isolated from animals to antibiotics especially to carbenicillin and gentamycine. Observations indicate differences in optical properties of the blue pigment, i.e. absorption centres in the UV region. Some differences in their physical properties were also noted.
TI  - Structural comparison suggests that thermolysin and related neutral proteases undergo hinge-bending motion during catalysis.
AB  - Crystal structures are known for three members of the bacterial neutral protease  family: thermolysin from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus (TLN), the neutral protease from Bacillus cereus (NEU), and the elastase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAE), both in free and ligand-bound forms. Each enzyme consists of an N-terminal and C-terminal domain with the active site formed at the junction of the two domains. Comparison of the different molecules reveals that the structure within each domain is well conserved, but there are substantial hinge-bending displacements (up to 16 degrees) of one domain relative to the other. These domain motions can be correlated with the presence or absence of bound inhibitor, as was previously observed in the specific example of PAE [Thayer, M.M., Flaherty, K.M., & McKay, D.B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2864-2871]. The binding of inhibitor appears to be associated with a reduction of the domain hinge-bending angle by 6-14 degrees and a closure of the "jaws" of the active site cleft by about 2 A. Crystallographic refinement of the structure of thermolysin suggests that electron density seen in the active site of the enzyme in the original structure determination probably corresponds to a bound dipeptide. Thus, the crystal structure appears to correspond to an enzyme-inhibitor or enzyme-product complex, rather than the free enzyme, as has previously been assumed.
TI  - The role of the pro-sequence in the processing and secretion of the thermolysin-like neutral protease from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The Bacillus cereus cnp gene coding for the thermolysin-like neutral protease (TNP) has been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Bacillus subtilis. The protease is first produced as a pre-pro-protein (M(r) = 61,000); the pro-peptide is approximately two-thirds of the size of the mature protein. The pro-sequence has been compared with those of six other TNPs, and significant homologies have been found. Additionally, the TNP pro-sequences are shown to be homologous to the pro-sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase. A mutant has been constructed from cnp, in which 23 amino acids upstream from the pro-protein processing site have been deleted. This region has no homologous analogue in any of the other TNP pro-sequences. The deletion results in a delay of six to eight hours in detection of active protease in the growth medium, as well as a 75% decrease in maximum protease production. N-terminal analysis of the mutant mature protein demonstrates that the processing site is unaltered by the pro-sequence deletion. The deletion must, therefore, modulate the kinetics of processing and/or secretion of the pro-protein.
TI  - Critical micelle concentration and hemolytic activity--a correlation suggested by the marine sterol, halistanol trisulfate.
AB  - The marine natural product, halistanol trisulfate, has a relatively low critical  micelle concentration of 0.001% m/v (14.5 microM) and strong hemolytic potency with an EC50 of 0.00046% m/v (6.67 microM). As expected of a detergent, it inhibits the growth of gram-positive but not gram-negative bacteria. The hemolytic activity of halistanol trisulfate and other detergents has been shown to correlate with critical micelle concentration. This correlation may have important implications in the mechanism of membranolytic bioactivity.
TI  - [Microbial contamination of twenty drugs of plant origin].
AB  - Twenty drugs of plant origin were analysed in order to determine the microbial contamination level. A light homogenizing method was used to avoid an increase in the antimicrobial capacity of certain drugs, which would falsify the analytical results. The total viable aerobic count (TVC) varied from 10(1) to 10(7) CFU/g and in 11 samples out of 21 was equal to or higher than 10(5) CFU/g. The number of fungi varied from one drug to another, but was generally lower than the aerobic TVC to the power of 10. No cases containing Aspergillus flavus were found. The total viable anaerobic count consisted mainly of facultative anaerobic germs. Aerobic spores and facultative anaerobic bacteria were abundant. They often represented more than 50% of the aerobic TVC and among them, Bacillus cereus was found. Concerning specified micro-organisms, Escherichia coli was found 3 times, Staphylococcus aureus 2 times and Pseudomonas (not aeruginosa) a few times. Salmonella was never found. The Enterobacteriaceae, on the other hand, were often found and in some cases their number can be greater than 10(4) CFU/g. The typed bacteria corresponded to Enterobacter spp. Some drug samples in bags were analysed. The level of contamination was identical to that found in the bulk drugs. The analysis in parallel of a black tea sample showed an aerobic TVC of 4.10(3) CFU/g. Specified micro-organisms were not found in the infusions. In comparison with non-boiled drugs, the survivors can represent up to 30% of the aerobic TVC.
TI  - Metabolism of nitric oxide in denitrifying Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nitrate-respiring Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Suspensions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were continuously sparged with nitrogen to remove gaseous products of nitrate reduction. Under these conditions, P. aeruginosa denitrified nitrate to 4% NO, 47% N2O and 49% N2. B. cereus reduced nitrate to 94% nitrite, 2% NO and 5% N2O. B. cereus was unable to reduce NO or N2O as sole electron acceptor, whereas P. aeruginosa reduced NO stoichiometrically to N2O when the N2O reductase was inhibited by acetylene or when the formed N2O was immediately flushed out of the incubation vessel. The mechanism and the reason for NO production in nitrate-respiring B. cereus are unknown, but the amounts of NO released were in a similar range as in the denitrifying P. aeruginosa and thus may be of similar environmental importance.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Mureidomycin A, a new inhibitor of bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis.
AB  - Mureidomycin A (MRD), a novel peptidylnucleoside antibiotic with antipseudomonal  activity, inhibited not only peptidoglycan synthesis but also lipid-intermediate formation from UDP-N-acetylmuramyl (MurNAc)-pentapeptide and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine in an in vitro peptidoglycan-synthesizing system, using ether-treated cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both types of inhibition by MRD disappeared when UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was preincubated with ether-treated cells. Moreover, MRD completely inhibited lipid-intermediate I (undecaprenyl-p-p-MurNAc-pentapeptide) formation at a concentration below the MIC. From these results, it was concluded that the real target of MRD's action was translocase, which catalyzes lipid-intermediate I formation from UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and a lipid carrier.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - [The effect of glutaraldehyde on mycobacteria and on selected types of bacteria].
AB  - The author tested the action of 2% alkalinized glutaraldehyde on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. avium, M. xenopi and M. fortuitum, as well as Staphyloccocus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, B. megatherium and B. subtilis. After 5-minute exposure devitalization of M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii and vegetative forms of the tested bacteria occurred. A sporicide effect was recorded already after 30 minutes or after more than 120 minutes. Most resistant were potentially pathogenic M. fortuitum, M. xenopi and M. avium where the disinfectant effect (a drop of CFU by 99.99%) was recorded after 7-63 minutes and their complete devitalization occurred after 3 (M. fortuitum) to 20 hours' (M. avium) action. The author recommends therefore exposure for 24 hours for sterilization of objects contamined with the above species of mycobacteria. This pertains in particular to instruments which cannot be sterilized by heat (endoscopes, bronchoscopes, sigmoidoscopes etc.), used in the diagnosis of mycobacterioses in patients with compromised immunity, e.g. in AIDS.
TI  - Bacterial sorption of heavy metals.
AB  - Four bacteria, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were examined for the ability to remove Ag+, Cd2+, Cu2+, and La3+ from solution by batch equilibration methods. Cd and Cu sorption over the concentration range 0.001 to 1 mM was described by Freundlich isotherms. At 1 mM concentrations of both Cd2+ and Cu2+, P. aeruginosa and B. cereus were the most and least efficient at metal removal, respectively. Freundlich K constants indicated that E. coli was most efficient at Cd2+ removal and B. subtilis removed the most Cu2+. Removal of Ag+ from solution by bacteria was very efficient; an average of 89% of the total Ag+ was removed from the 1 mM solution, while only 12, 29, and 27% of the total Cd2+, Cu2+, and La3+, respectively, were sorbed from 1 mM solutions. Electron microscopy indicated that La3+ accumulated at the cell surface as needlelike, crystalline precipitates. Silver precipitated as discrete colloidal aggregates at the cell surface and occasionally in the cytoplasm. Neither Cd2+ nor Cu2+ provided enough electron scattering to identify the location of sorption. The affinity series for bacterial removal of these metals decreased in the order Ag greater than La greater than Cu greater than Cd. The results indicate that bacterial cells are capable of binding large quantities of different metals. Adsorption equations may be useful for describing bacterium-metal interactions with metals such as Cd and Cu; however, this approach may not be adequate when precipitation of metals occurs.
TI  - Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: purification properties and comparison with Bacillus cereus enzyme.
AB  - Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase (2-oxoethylphosphonate phosphonohydrolase, EC 3.11.1.1) has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa A 237 grown in a culture medium containing 2-aminoethylphosphonate as both phosphorus and carbon sources. The native Mr has been estimated to be 62,000 +/- 2000, using a gel filtration column equilibrated with standard proteins. A subunit of Mr 30,000 +/- 1000 determined in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gives evidence of a homodimeric structure. The enzyme, which catalyzes the C-P bond cleavage of phosphonoacetaldehyde, has a Km value of 210 microM. It is moderately inhibited by methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and butylphosphonic acids and activated by aminomethyl-, aminoethylphosphonic acids as well as by phosphonoformic, phosphonoacetic and phosphonopropionic acids. Inhibition by orthophosphite is a time-dependent process which exhibits first-order kinetics and is enhanced by the presence of acetaldehyde. Assays for phosphite removal by dilution or dialysis do not reverse the inhibition. Phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase inactivation by phosphite ion appears to be inconsistent with the concept of a Schiff base intermediate as proposed for Bacillus cereus enzyme.
TI  - Mortality in adult tsetse, Glossina morsitans morsitans, caused by entomopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Mortality in adult tsetse, Glossina morsitans morsitans, caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus sphaericus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis H-14, B. thuringiensis 1, B. thuringiensis 5, B. thuringiensis var. insraelensis, and Providentia rettgeri was determined. When bacteria were smeared on rabbit skin and tsetse allowed to feed only once on the contaminated area, mortality 8 days postingestion was significantly higher (P less than 0.01) in tsetse fed on P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens, B. thuringiensis 1, and P. rettgeri and increased when tsetse were allowed to feed for the second time on the contaminated skin. With this smear technique, however, mortalities were generally not remarkable. In artificial membrane feeding experiments using low concentrations of bacteria (-10(6)/ml of blood), the B. thuringiensis strains caused low mortality, except B. thuringiensis H-14, which caused 59% mortality. However, at this concentration, P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens, B. cereus, and P. rettgeri caused highly significant (P less than 0.01) mortality (64-96%). When higher concentrations of bacteria (10(7)/ml) were used, all the bacteria tested, except B. sphaericus, caused high mortality ranging from 70 to 98%. Thus, mortality depended on the species of bacteria, the dose ingested, and time postingestion.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A fragment of DNA containing the gene coding for the phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA appeared to code only for the alpha-toxin and contained both the coding region and its associated gene promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA was determined, and an open reading frame was identified which encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 42,528. By comparison of the gene sequence with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, a 28-amino-acid signal sequence was identified. The gene promoter showed considerable homology with the E. coli sigma 55 consensus promoter sequences, and this may explain why the gene was expressed by E. coli. The cloned gene product appeared to be virtually identical to the native protein. A 77-amino-acid stretch that was close to the N terminus of the alpha-toxin showed considerable homology with similarly located regions of the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine, preferring phospholipase C and weaker homology with the phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The migration of bacteria through gels in the presence of IUCD monofilament tails.
AB  - An in vitro model was developed to investigate the migration of a variety of bacteria of different characteristics through a gel system in the presence or absence of a wide range of polymer monofilament threads. The bacteria were unable to migrate through the gel from the point of inoculation in the absence of a solid substrate. Migration occurred along all thread types tested, including those used as IUCD marker tails and the extent of bacterial migration appeared to be determined primarily by the motility of the microorganisms. The implications of these findings in relation to the development of pelvic infections in IUCD wearers is discussed.
TI  - Germicidal effectiveness of Dialox, a new stable peroxyacetic acid solution, in the re-use of high-flux dialysers.
AB  - In this study we evaluate the effectiveness of a newly available peroxyacetic acid solution (Dialox) as a disinfecting agent in the re-use of highly permeable dialysers. The germicidal properties of Dialox were tested in an in vitro trial on previously used haemodiafilters (HF80, Fresenius) highly contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium smegmatis or sporulated Bacillus cereus. Complete freedom from bacterial contamination was observed 5 min after the reprocessing treatment on a Renatron reprocessing machine, using the currently marketed Dialox concentrate.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytotoxin: the influence of sphingomyelin on binding and cation permeability increase in mammalian erythrocytes.
AB  - A cytotoxic protein isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa damages the plasma membranes of many mammalian cells by forming pores. We studied binding of the 125I-cytotoxin and the resulting increase of cation permeability in erythrocytes of various mammalian species. The sensitivity of red blood cells was inversely related to the relative sphingomyelin content in their external surface. Thus, erythrocytes with a sphingomyelin to phosphatidylcholine ratio below 1 (dog, rat, rabbit and man) were sensitive, whereas red blood cells with a ratio above 1 (pig, cattle and sheep) were not attacked even with 100-fold higher cytotoxin concentrations. At 37 degrees C 6.8 +/- 1.2 x 10(3) molecules of 125I-cytotoxin were bound per rabbit erythrocyte (KD = 59 nM), whereas no binding occurred to cattle cells. Cleavage of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase C from Bacillus cereus (EC 3.1.4.12) triggered a dose-dependent enhancement in binding and permeability increase, particularly in red blood cells with a high proportion of sphingomyelin. The KDs for all animal species investigated were 53-60 nM. Pretreatment with mainly phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipases D from Streptomyces chromofuscus and cabbage (EC 3.1.4.4) or phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus (EC 3.1.4.3) did not influence the cytotoxin effect. The negative correlation between susceptibility and the proportion of sphingomyelin in plasma membranes suggests a binding site close to sphingomyelin.
TI  - Imipenem as substrate and inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
AB  - The interaction between imipenem, a carbapenem antibiotic, and two representative beta-lactamases has been studied. The first enzyme was beta-lactamase I, a class-A beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus; imipenem behaved as a slow substrate (kcat. 6.7 min-1, Km 0.4 mM at 30 degrees C and at pH 7) that reacted by a branched pathway. There was transient formation of an altered species formed in a reversible reaction; this species was probably an acyl-enzyme in a slightly altered, but considerably more labile, conformation. The kinetics of the reaction were investigated by measuring both the concentration of the substrate and the activity of the enzyme, which fell and then rose again more slowly. The second enzyme was the chromosomal class-C beta-lactamase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa; imipenem was a substrate with a low kcat. (0.8 min-1) and a low Km (0.7 microM). Possible implications for the clinical use of imipenem are considered.
TI  - Beta-lactamase inhibitors. The inhibition of serine beta-lactamases by specific boronic acids.
AB  - Many beta-lactamases have active-site serine residues, and are competitively inhibited by boronic acids. Hitherto, the boronic acids used have lacked any structural resemblance to the substrates of beta-lactamases. Phenylacetamidomethaneboronic acid, trifluoroacetamidomethaneboronic acid and 2,6-dimethoxybenzamidomethaneboronic acid have now been synthesized. The first of these contains the side-chain moiety of penicillin G, and the last that of methicillin. The pH-dependence of binding of the first inhibitor to beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus revealed pK values of 4.7 and 8.2 for (presumably) active-site groups in the enzyme. The kinetics of inhibition were studied by cryoenzymology and by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. These techniques provided evidence for a two-step mechanism of binding of the first two boronic acids mentioned above to beta-lactamase I, and for benzeneboronic acid to a beta-lactamase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The slower step is probably associated with a change in enzyme conformation as well as the formation of an O-B bond between the active-site serine hydroxy group and the boronic acid.
TI  - The influence of pyrithione on the growth of micro-organisms.
AB  - Pyrithione was active against a range of micro-organisms, the most resistant being Gram-negative bacteria. The growth curves for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus licheniformis showed a drug-dependent lag phase. Candida albicans grew with a drug-dependent growth rate. EDTA antagonized the effects of pyrithione.
TI  - In vitro activity of fleroxacin (Ro23-6240), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone against isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Fleroxacin (Ro23-6240; AM 833), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and A-56620, against 747 isolates from cancer patients. Fleroxacin inhibited more than 90% of Enterobacteriacea isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was also extremely active against Aeromonas hydrophila and Haemophilus influenzae isolates with MIC90 values of 0.12 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Acinetobacter spp. was 1.0 micrograms/ml, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.0 micrograms/ml, and for other Pseudomonas spp., 8.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus isolates including methicillin-resistant strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for three different species of coagulase-negative Staphylococci was 1.0 microgram/ml. Streptococcal species required 8-16 micrograms/ml for inhibition. Fleroxacin was also active against group JK-diphtheroids and Bacillus cereus. The overall activity of fleroxacin was similar to that of enoxacin and less than that of A-56620 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  - Two Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth  and a meat medium with Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both S. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of S. faecalis in BHI broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the S. aureus inoculum was greater than the S. faecalis inoculum. S. aureus FRI-100 grown with B. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the S. aureus inoculum was much higher than the B. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), whereas S. aureus FRI-196E produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. S. aureus grown with E. coli in BHI broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the E. coli inoculum was greater than the S. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the E. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), S. aureus FRI-100 grown with P. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the P. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) CFU). It can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.
TI  - Cryoenzymology of beta-lactamases.
AB  - The cryoenzymology of several different beta-lactamases has been investigated. Particular attention has been paid to the experimental pitfalls of the technique. These include such factors as false bursts at the start of the reaction, instability of the enzymes during turnover, and Km values so high that little of the enzyme is present as a complex. Many of the difficulties in cryoenzymology stem from the use of organic cryosolvents. A novel "salt" cryosolvent has been tested: ammonium acetate solutions can be used down to about -60 degrees C. The enzymes examined are readily soluble, and stable, in this solvent. Nevertheless, out of 17 beta-lactamase beta-lactam systems, only 4 proved suitable for detailed investigation. In two of these, the hydrolysis of nitrocefin or 7-(thienyl-2-acetamido)-3-[[2-[[4- (dimethylamino)phenyl]azo]pyridinio]-methyl]cephem-4-carboxylic acid (PADAC), by beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus, substrate was converted into product at a slow enough rate (at -60 or -55 degrees C, respectively) for it to be possible to do successive scans during the course of the reaction. The spectra were those of substrate and product, and no intermediate was detected. The results argue against the accumulation of intermediate acyl-enzyme. The hydrolysis of PADAC by the P99 beta-lactamase from Enterobacter cloacae again showed spectra characteristic of substrate and product, and there was, moreover, a break in the Arrhenius plot; it is possible that a conformational change is (at least partially) rate-determining. The hydrolysis of dinitrophenylpenicillin by the P99 beta-lactamase did show features suggesting the accumulation of acyl-enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Traumatic wound infection due to Bacillus cereus in an immunocompromised patient: a case report.
AB  - A young man recently responding to immunosuppressive therapy for acute myelocytic leukemia was admitted with fever and haemorrhagic blebs on both extremities after sustaining some scratch marks in a muddy pond. Gram stains of the hemorrhagic fluid in the blebs revealed many gram positive bacilli. B. cereus was identified from culture of tissue fluid. He did not respond to therapy despite bacteriological cure. Terminally, he developed Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia and generalized bleeding.
TI  - Bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  - The ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. Three oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. Exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. Complete recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. However, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. Using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 W for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.
TI  - Carboxy groups as essential residues in beta-lactamases.
AB  - Beta-lactamases are divided into classes A, B and C on the basis of their amino acid sequences. Beta-Lactamases were incubated at pH 4.0 with the carboxy-group reagent 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodi-imide plus a coloured nucleophile and the extents of inactivation and nucleophile incorporation were monitored. Two class A enzymes (from Bacillus cereus and Bacillus licheniformis) and two class C enzymes (from Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were examined. All four enzymes were inactivated, with total inactivation corresponding to the incorporation of approx. 2-3 mol of nucleophile/mol of enzyme. In the case of beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus, some 53% of the incorporated nucleophile was located on glutamic acid-168 in the amino acid sequence.
TI  - A preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in Nigeria.
AB  - The aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in Nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. In parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. The aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included Streptococcus salivarius, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermides. In general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. An analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. There was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load in mother's milk. Milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.
TI  - [Antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
AB  - This study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. The samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. The test microorganisms included Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium phlei, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus. Raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. The antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. However, green onion could inhibit P. aeruginosa and M. luteus, but onion could inhibit E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. faecalis, and B. cereus. Ginger and ginger root could only inhibit M. luteus. Chili pepper could inhibit V. parahaemolyticus and P. vulgaris. Brown pepper could also inhibit P. vulgaris. Sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. In general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. All the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees C.
TI  - beta-Casomorphin immunoreactive materials in cows' milk incubated with various bacterial species.
AB  - To obtain information about the possible release of beta-casomorphins from beta-casein under in vitro conditions, cows' milk was incubated with 13 strains of Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacterial species isolated from bovine milk. After incubation periods of 1-24 d, milk samples were assayed for beta-casomorphin-4, -5, -6 or -7 immunoreactive materials. In general, no beta-casomorphin immunoreactive material was found in samples incubated with non-caseolytic strains, e.g. Pseudomonas putida or Streptococcus faecalis subsp. faecalis; however, high levels were found in several samples incubated with caseolytic strains, e.g. Ps. aeruginosa or Bacillus cereus. When such materials were present, the amounts of beta-casomorphin-4, -6 or -7 greatly exceeded beta-casomorphin-5 immunoreactivity. It was concluded that while some of these materials probably represented authentic beta-casomorphins, others were more likely to be beta-casomorphin precursors.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
TI  - The pH-dependence of class B and class C beta-lactamases.
AB  - The classification by structure allots beta-lactamases to (at present) three classes, A, B and C. The pH-dependence of the kinetic parameters for class B and class C have been determined. They differ from each other and from class A beta-lactamases. The class B enzyme was beta-lactamase II from Bacillus cereus 569/H/9. The plots of kcat against pH for the hydrolysis of benzylpenicillin by Zn(II)-requiring beta-lactamase II and Co(II)-requiring beta-lactamase II were not symmetrical, but those of kcat/Km were. A similar feature was observed for the hydrolysis of both benzylpenicillin and cephalosporin C by a class C beta-lactamase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results have been interpreted by a scheme in which two ionic forms of an intermediate can give product, but do so at differing rates.
TI  - [Bacteria decomposing alpha-methylstyrol].
AB  - Two bacterial strains assimilating alpha-methylsterene as a sole carbon and energy source were isolated from the sewage of an industrial plant producing synthetic rubber. The morphological, cultural and physiologo-biochemical properties of the strains were studied and their taxonomic position was determined. One of the cultures was classified as Bacillus cereus and the other as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rate of alpha-methylsterene destruction in the chemically defined medium was shown to depend on the conditions of cultivation.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of dissociated and undissociated sorbic acid at different pH levels.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration of sorbic acid has been determined for Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The inhibition was shown to be due to both undissociated and dissociated acid, and the effect of each has been calculated in accordance with a proposed mathematical model. Although the inhibitory action of undissociated acid was 10-600 times greater than that of dissociated acid, the latter caused more than 50% of the growth inhibition at pH levels above 6 for most of the organisms tested.
TI  - [Bacillus cereus strain 147: producer of tetramethylpyrazine].
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial substance from Carica papaya fruit extract.
AB  - Ripe and unripe Carica papaya fruits (epicarp, endocarp, seeds and leaves) were extracted separately and purified. All the extracts except that of leaves produced very significant antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shigella flexneri. The MIC of the substance was small (0.2-0.3 mg/ml) for gram-positive bacteria and large (1.5-4 mg/ml) for gram-negative bacteria. The substance was bactericidal and showed properties of a protein. Other proteins previously found in C. papaya did not show antibacterial activity.
TI  - Penem derivatives: beta-lactamase stability and affinity for penicillin-binding proteins in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Penem derivatives, a new group of beta-lactam antibiotics with potent activities  against a wide range of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested for their stability against hydrolysis by beta-lactamases purified from clinical isolates of Morganella morganii. Proteus vulgaris, and Escherichia coli and by a penicillinase from Bacillus cereus. Penems having 6 alpha substituents, such as hydroxyethyl, hydroxymethyl, and ethyl groups, were very stable against hydrolysis by each of the enzymes. Penems having no 6 alpha substituents were easily hydrolyzed by P. vulgaris and E. coli enzymes, whereas they were rather stable against hydrolysis by M. morganii and B. cereus enzymes, a typical cephalosporinase and penicillinase, respectively. Affinity of the penems for E. coli penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) was also tested. beta-Lactamase-stable penems having a 6 alpha-hydroxyethyl group showed high affinity for PBP-4, -5, and -6 as well as for PBP-1A, -1Bs, and -2. However, the penems having no 6 alpha substituents showed a far lower affinity for PBP-4, -5, and -6 than that shown by the corresponding 6 alpha-hydroxyethyl penems. Among the penems tested, affinity for PBP-4, -5, and -6 was closely related to their beta-lactamase stability, as was the case among cephamycins and cephalosporins. Effects of the penems on the morphology of a strain of E. coli are also described.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity evaluation of cefodizime (HR221), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefodizime (HR221) is a new alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporin developed by Hoechst-Roussel with a reported serum half-life of over 2 h. In vitro susceptibility studies showed that the cefodizime spectrum includes all those Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp., and Neisseria spp. normally susceptible to cefotaxime (HR756) or ceftizoxime (FK749) or both. Cefodizime was less active (two- to eightfold) than cefotaxime or ceftizoxime against some enteric species, but was the most potent drug against some strains of Morganella spp. and Proteus vulgaris. Enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and most Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to cefodizime (median minimum inhibitory concentrations, greater than or equal to 64 microgram/ml). Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains required cefodizime concentrations of 32 microgram/ml to inhibit 50% of tested strains. Cefodizime was very stable to hydrolysis by Richmond-Sykes type I, II, III, and IV beta-lactamases, as well as the enzyme derived from Bacillus cereus. The reference PADAC and nitrocefin substrate hydrolysis by a type I beta-lactamase was markedly inhibited (greater than 80%) by cefodizime at concentrations 0.4 to 4% of substrate concentration. Cefodizime was active against 43% of bacteria which were resistant to cephalothin and cefamandole and against 58% of those resistant to aminoglycosides.
TI  - Ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the United States. A total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. Ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against Enterobacteriaceae. Of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had CTAZ MICs < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. Only Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime MIC(90S) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). Staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode MIC 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. Ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. In other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. Enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime MIC90 >8 mg/l. Only cefsulodin (mode MIC 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode MIC 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime MIC(50S) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. Ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the MIC, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). It perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of Types I-V and Bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. Ceftazidime inhibited only Type I Ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Quality control data are presented. Tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible MICs of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. Staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or MICs. We found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of street heroin.
AB  - Street heroin and injection paraphernalia have been implicated as sources of bacteria causing infections in drug abusers [1]. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus are common etiologic agents. In a previous study of the microbiology of street heroin and injection paraphernalia, Bacillus species was the predominant isolate [2]. We did not find S. aureus, but one study reported isolates of identical phage type from heroin powder and from an infected patient [3]. To reconcile the results of our recent investigation among drug abusers with panophthalmitis, we theorized that the drug mixture might have an antibacterial effect. Of the samples of street heroin tested, all except one were bactericidal against S. aureus. The single sample with no heroin content was not bactericidal against one isolate of S. aureus and was the only sample that exhibited some degree of inhibitory and bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa. All samples were bactericidal against the two isolates of B. cereus tested. Quinine exhibited bactericidal activity against S. aureus and B. cereus but was ineffective against P. aeruginosa. Our findings indicate that most samples of street heroin have antibacterial effects against S. aureus and B. cereus but no activity against P. aeruginosa. Such activity may be due to the quinine content of the mixture. The apparent lack of recovery of S. aureus from street heroin may be partially explained by this phenomenon.

TI  - Effect of dyes on the quantitative recovery of Yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  - A total of 69 dyes were incorporated separately at different concentrations into  an agar medium for evaluation of their effects on the quantitative recovery of five serotypes of Yersinia enterocolitica. One strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain of Bacillus cereus were included for comparative purposes. Certain dyes were evaluated further for their selective properties with five additional serotypes of Y. enterocolitica, three strains of P. aeruginosa, and two of Engerobacter spp. Metanil yellow was the only dye which was tolerated bettr by Y. enterocolitica than by P. aeruginosa. Dye sensitivity was variable amond strains of the same serotype of Y. enterocolitica. In general, Y. enterocolitica showed a tolerance to dyes greater than that of gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of other gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Toxicity of zinc to fungi, bacteria, and coliphages: influence of chloride ions.
AB  - A 10 mM concentration of Zn2+ decreased the survival of Escherichia coli; enhanced the survival of Bacillus cereus; did not significantly affect the survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Norcardia corallina, and T1, T7, P1, and phi80 coliphages; completely inhibited mycelial growth of Rhizoctonia solani; and reduced mycelial growth of Fusarium solani, Cunninghamella echinulata, Aspergillus niger, and Trichoderma viride. The toxicity of zinc to the fungi, bacteria, and coliphages was unaffected, lessened, or increased by the addition of high concentrations of NaCl. The increased toxicity of zinc in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl was not a result of a synergistic interaction between Zn2+ and elevated osmotic pressures but of the formation of complex anionic ZnCl species that exerted greater toxicities than did cationic Zn2+. Conversely, the decrease in zinc toxicity with increasing concentrations of NaCl probably reflected the decrease in the levels of Zn2+ due to the formation of Zn-Cl species, which was less inhibitory to these microbes than was Zn2+. A. niger tolerated higher concentrations of zinc in the presence of NaCl at 37 than at 25 degrees C.
TI  - [Microbial resistance to formaldehyde. I. Comparative quantitative studies in some selected species of vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, bacteriophages and viruses].
AB  - The resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. As test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi-B, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis), fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans), bacteriophages (Escherichia coli phages, T1, T2, T3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). For the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees C) and pH (7.0). The microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (N/N0); where: N0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; N equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). For all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. In all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella paratyphi-B were found to be more susceptible than Staphylococcus aureus (vf. Fig. 1 A). The strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. To obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. Streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than Staphylococcus aureus. In the case of Streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. For the killing of Candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. The conidia of Aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of Candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of Staphylococcus aureus (see Fig. 1 B). In the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. If the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees C, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). The spores of Bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. To reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...
TI  - [Possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  - In the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. As shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (Klebsiella ozanae, K. pneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus pneumoniae), Mycoplasma pneumoniae and M. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Brucella abortus, Erysipelothrix insidiosa, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, S. typhi). Consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the C-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. In modified Boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). Corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. Finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated ones (fig. 1).
TI  - Phospholipase D activity of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A phospholipase hydrolyzing cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl glycerol was characterized in gram-negative bacteria but was absent in preparations of gram-positive bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver mitochondria. In cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonase aeruginosa, this cardiolipin-hydrolyzing enzyme had similar pH and Mg2+ requirements and displayed a specificity which excluded phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine as substrates.
TI  - Comparison of methods for extraction of bacterial adenine nucleotides determined  by firefly assay.
AB  - Adenine nucleotides in Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were extracted using 10 different methods. Extracts were assayed for adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) by the firefly method using an improved procedure. Analytical interference by bacterial enzymes not inactivated during the extraction was found to be a major problem. However, these enzymes were inactivated to a considerable extent by the inclusion of ethylenediaminetetraacetate in the extraction reagent. The 10 extraction methods were compared with respect to yield of adenine nucleotides, interference with the enzymic assay, reproducibility of the method, and stability of the extracts. Results indicated that extraction with trichloroacetic acid was the method most closely reflecting actual levels of ATP, ADP and AMP in intact bacterial cells. However, for the extraction of ATP in some bacterial strains several other methods may be used and may be advantageous from a practical point of view.
TI  - Thin-layer chromatographic technique for rapid detection of bacterial phospholipases.
AB  - Silica gel thin-layer chromatography was employed to detect lecithinase activity  induced from bacterial resting cell preparations induced from bacterial resting cell preparations incubated at 37 C for 4 h in the presence of purified egg yolk lecithin. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa hydrolyzed lecithin with the formation of free fatty acids as the sole lipid-soluble product. In none of the Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii strains tested could lecithinase activity be detected. Four among eight strains of Enterobacter aerogenes and one among 12 strains of Proteus tested produced negligible amounts of free fatty acid.
TI  - [Occurrence and function of a proteinase inhibitor in the hemolymph of insects].
AB  - The presence of proteinase inhibitor has been proved in the hemolymph of a number of insect species from seven different insect orders. The amount of proteinase inhibitor in the hemolymph significantly increases after injection of inactivated bacteria into the hemocoelom of Galleria mellonella-larvae. Moreover the larvae show an increased resistance against normally lethal concentrations of trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase P and extracellular proteinase produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is discussed that the proteinase inhibitor is one of the factors acting in the antibacterial defense system in the hemolymph of Galleria mellonella-larvae.
TI  - Determination of bacterial cell concentrations by electrical measurements.
AB  - An instrument was developed to measure the concentration of bacterial suspensions by their electrical characteristics. It employed a square-wave signal generator, a tetra-polar electrode probe, and a voltage detector in the form of an oscilloscope. When electrical measurements were made on washed bacteria obtained from cultures or urine specimens, there was a direct relationship between the concentration of the cells and the electrical characteristics of the system as reflected by voltage changes. As little as 10(3) organisms per ml could be detected. The resolution between readings taken on samples containing 10(3) to 10(9) cells per ml was found to be a function of the input frequency. The maximal resolution between concentration readings was obtained at a input frequency of 10 Hz. Thus, with relatively simple instrumentation, bacterial concentrations could be determined within a few minutes. This technique, therefore, eliminates the more lengthy laboratory procedures as plate counts or the accumulation of measurable metabolic changes (such as the utilization of radioactive or other substrates). This method can efficiently monitor clinical urine specimens when a bacteriuria is suspected.

AB  - A new cephalosporin with a highly reactive beta-lactam ring was found to give an  immediate color change in the presence of beta-lactamases from many bacteria, including staphylococci, Bacillus species, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas. The reaction is confined to organisms producing beta-lactamases, but it is sufficiently sensitive to indicate the presence of this enzyme is small amounts in strains previously considered not to produce it. The compound has an unusual ultraviolet spectrum, and the color change can be followed quantitatively by measuring changes in absorption which occur in the 380- to 500-nm region, where cephalosporins normally have no absorption. The development of color is thought to be a consequence of the beta-lactam ring being unusually highly conjugated with the 3-substituent. Although in the bacteria only beta-lactamases produce this color change, it was found that serum and tissues from experimental animals also rapidly produced the colored breakdown product, which was then excreted in the urine. The mechanism of the mammalian breakdown was considered to be different from that found in bacteria.

The arrangement of individual cells within colonies could be seen. Cells of Bacillus colonies tended to be longer than in liquid culture and irregular in shape and to give the appearance of branching. B. megaterium colonies frequently had a dense covering film. Colonies of gram-negative bacteria consisted of fairly short rods covered by much adherent extracellular material. L. acidophilus had colonies comprised of densely packed, well-oriented rods. C. hofmanni colonies contained coccobacilli, packed together. Correlations were observed between plano-convex colony form and densely packed cells, rough colony form and random arrangement of well-separated microorganisms, and irregular colony edge and tendency of cells to grow out from the colony in filaments.

AB  - Doi, Roy H. (Syracuse University, Syracuse, N.Y.), and Richard T. Igarashi. Conservation of ribosomal and messenger ribonucleic acid cistrons in Bacillus species. J. Bacteriol. 90:384-390. 1965.-Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) fractions from various Bacillus species were tested for interspecies DNA-RNA hybrid formation. DNA preparations from B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. stearothermophilus, and B. macerans, whose base composition varied from 33 to 50% guanylate + cytidylate content, were used in the hybrid annealing mixtures with pulse-labeled RNA from sporulating cells and from log-phase cells of B. subtilis and B. cereus. Efficient hybridization in these cases was obtained only in homologous annealing situations. When heterologous DNA and RNA preparations were tested for hybrid formation, only 1 to 6% of the homologous hybridization was obtained. Although the efficiency of hybrid formation was low, the results were reproducible. No difference in efficiency of hybrid formation was observed between the messenger RNA from sporulating cells and that from log-phase cells. When B. subtilis ribosomal RNA was placed in annealing mixtures with heterologous DNA, 47.5 to 62.9% of the homologous hybridization was obtained. These results suggest that a small number of identical sequences are present among the Bacillus species. Furthermore, the ribosomal RNA cistrons appear to be more highly conserved relative to other genetic sequences.
TI  - PRODUCTION AND PARTIAL PURIFICATION OF ANTIBIOTIC MATERIALS FORMED BY PHYSARUM GYROSUM.
AB  - Pure cultures of Physarum gyrosum were grown on agar plates with autoclaved Escherichia coli suspensions as the growth medium. Portions of such agar, after growth of the slime mold, contained diffusible materials that inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Paper chromatography of extracts of such cultures revealed at least three different active fractions. Preliminary fractionations increased the specific activity by one order of magnitude, probably in part by removal of inactive material and in part by separating active components. The fractionations also demonstrated the multiplicity of the antibiotic activity. Fractions variously obtained always retarded the growth of the bacterial species listed above.

Bacteriol. 86:713-716. 1963.-The 3- and 5- nucleotidase activity in various bacterial species was investigated. Both enzymes were found in bacterial extracts in varying proportions. The nucleotidases were found to be very active in Proteus vulgaris, in which organism they were studied in detail. The relative activities, the pH optima, and the effect of metal ions were investigated. It was concluded that bacterial 3- and 5-nucleotidases are distinct and separate enzymes.

AB  - A variety of bacteriophages specific for different hosts, including Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio comma, were frozen at a controlled rate to liquid nitrogen temperatures, and then quick-thawed. Glycerol (10%) was used as a protective additive. Quantitative determinations showed from 10% to virtually 100% recovery in the various cases. Host specificity, plaque morphology, and, in one case, rate of inactivation of phage by homologous antiserum remained unchanged.
