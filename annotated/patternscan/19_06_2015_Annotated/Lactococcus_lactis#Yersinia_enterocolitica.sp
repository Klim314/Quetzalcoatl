TI  == biophysical characterization of the type iii secretion tip proteins and the tip proteins attached to bacterium-like particles.
AB  == bacterium-like particles (blps), derived from lactococcus lactis, offer a self-adjuvanting delivery vehicle for subunit protein vaccines. proteins can be specifically loaded onto the blps via a peptidoglycan anchoring (pa) domain. in this study, the tip proteins ipad, sipd, and lcrv belonging to type iii secretion systems of shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica, and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively, were fused to the pa and loaded onto the blps. herein, we biophysically characterized these nine samples and condensed the spectroscopic results into three-index empirical phase diagrams (epds). the epds show distinctions between the ipad/sipd and lcrv subfamilies of tip proteins, based on their physical stability, even upon addition of the pa. upon attachment to the blps, the blps become defining moiety in the spectroscopic measurements, leaving  the tip proteins to have a subtle yet modulating effect on the structural integrity of the tip proteins-blps binding. in summary, this work provides a comprehensive view of physical stability of the tip proteins and tip protein-blps and serves as a baseline for screening of excipients to increase the stability of the tip protein-blps for future vaccine formulation.

TI  == probiotic characterization of potential hydrolases producing lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolated from pickled yam.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize potential probiotic strain co-producing alpha-amylase and beta-galactosidase. sixty-three strains, isolated from pickle samples were screened for their hydrolase producing capacity by utilizing different starches as carbon source. one out of 63 strains, isolated from traditionally fermented pickled yam showing maximum hydrolase activity (alpha-amylase (36.9 u/ml) and beta-galactosidase (42.6 u/ml)) within a period of 48 hours was identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. further, it was assessed for the probiotic characteristics under gastrointestinal conditions like acidic, alkaline, proteolytic enzymes, bile stress and found to exhibit tolerance to these stresses. the therapeutic potential of the isolate is implicated because of its antagonistic effect against enteric foodborne pathogens (salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli 0157:h7, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica and aeromonas hydrophila). the results of this study entail a potential applicability of the isolate in developing future probiotic foods besides the production of industrially significant hydrolases.

TI  == differentiation of lactococci from 2 greek cheeses with protected designation of  origin by phenotypic criteria and rapd-pcr.
AB  == seventy-six lactococci isolates from 2 protected designation of origin (pdo) cheeses were studied for their acidification ability, proteolytic activity, and inhibitory activities as well as their intraspecies characterization by randomly  amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). fifty-two of them were characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by the sds-page of whole-cell proteins. the test strains increased the amount of acid in milk from 6 to 24 h as well as the quantities of amino acids on incubation for 4 d. the majority of the isolates degraded preferentially alphas-casein. the isolates from feta differed from those of graviera kritis in respect of beta-casein degradation. this fragment was either not degraded or underwent a small degradation by lactococci from feta. a stronger intensity of acidification for the isolates from feta and a higher casein breakdown ability for those from graviera kritis were also recorded. lactococci from feta and graviera kritis inhibited, preferentially, the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, and yersinia enterocolitica, respectively. a high heterogeneity among the isolates according to rapd-pcr was determined, as well as grouping of the isolates according to their source of isolation. selected isolates from each cheese could be used as starters to make either feta or graviera kritis.

TI  == a dna array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  == an oligonucleotide array based on pcr method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the  simultaneous identification of 14 lactic acid bacteria (lab) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. the hypervariable regions v3 and v6 of 16s, together with a variable region of 23s rrna genes and several genes specific for  virulence factors were selected. universal primers and multiplex pcr were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. the dominant species such as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, andleuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dutps. the results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic dna from campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. a clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic diversity of lactococcus lactis isolates from batzos, a  greek pdo raw goat milk cheese.
AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

TI  == the screening of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria and their application to inactivating psychrotrophic food-borne pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated from various food samples and evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production. cells suspended in 0.5% (wt/vol) glucose plus 0.5% (wt/vol) lactate (ph 7.0) were incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees c under  aeration. among 193 strains, 27 strains accumulated 201-300 ppm h2o2, and 4 strains accumulated more than 301 ppm h2o2 in the cell suspensions. among the 9 high-level h2o2-producing strains, 8 strains were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the cell-free filtrate from lc. lactis subsp. lactis ai 62, which contained approximately 350 ppm h2o2, was evaluated for antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, listeria ivanovii, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, and aeromonas hydrophila. after 1 h incubation at 30 degrees c in the cell-free filtrate, the initial viable cell counts of the target bacteria (5.53-6.00 log cfu/ml) were reduced by 0.12-5.00 log units, except in the case of enterococci. the sensitivity varied with the bacterial species and ph. the enterococci were resistant to the treatment. our results show that h2o2 accumulated by lactic acid bacteria in a cell suspension is very effective in reducing the viable cell count of food-borne pathogens.

TI  == minimum inhibitory concentration of smoke wood extracts against spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms associated with foods.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of seven commercial smoke preparations (four liquid and three solid) was studied. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined against a selection of food spoilage and pathogenic micro-organisms. the main smoke components were identified and quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the most effective condensate was s2. all strains except salmonella enteritidis were inhibited by s2 with an mic < 0.5-1.5%. smoke extract l2 inhibited growth of vibrio vulnificus, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, l. inocua, brochothrix thermosphacta and lactococcus lactis ssp lactis with an mic of < 0.2-0.8%. the condensate l3 inhibited effectively v. vulnificus, b. subtilis, l. innocua and staph. aureus. l1, l4, s1 and s3 had no inhibitory effects at levels tested against most micro-organisms. vibrio vulnificus was the  most susceptible micro-organism to test compounds. the antimicrobial activity of  smoke preparations was related to the concentration of phenols.
