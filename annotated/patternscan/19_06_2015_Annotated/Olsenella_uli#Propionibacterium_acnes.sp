TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == identification of bacteria enduring endodontic treatment procedures by a combined reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and reverse-capture checkerboard  approach.
AB  == introduction: this study identified the bacterial taxa enduring endodontic treatment procedures by using a combined 16s ribosomal rna-based reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization approach. methods: samples were taken from infected canals of 15 teeth with apical periodontitis before treatment (s1), after chemomechanical preparation with naocl as the irrigant (s2), and after interappointment medication with a calcium hydroxide paste (s3). bacterial presence was first screened by a dna-based single pcr assay. rna extracts were subjected to rt-pcr, and the resulting products were surveyed for the presence of 28 targeted taxa by using the checkerboard method. results: bacteria were found in all s1 samples. detectable levels of bacterial ribosomal rna, used as an indicator of viability, were observed in 60% of the cases after chemomechanical preparation and 53% after intracanal medication. the most prevalent taxa in s1 were olsenella uli (67%), pyramidobacter piscolens (60%), streptococcus species (53%), and bacteroidetes clone x083 (53%). streptococcus species (47%), fusobacterium nucleatum (40%), and o. uli (33%) prevailed in s2, whereas streptococcus species (47%), propionibacterium acnes (27%), and o. uli (27%) were the most frequent taxa in s3. conclusions: the present study with a combined molecular approach revealed that bacterial diversity was overall markedly reduced by treatment procedures. although bacterial taxa more frequently identified in post-treatment samples emerge as potential risk factors for persistent disease, this remains to be determined by longitudinal studies.

TI  == anaerobic, non-sporulating, gram-positive bacilli bacteraemia characterized by 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == owing to the difficulties in identifying anaerobic, non-sporulating, gram-positive bacilli in clinical microbiology laboratories, the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of disease of many of these bacteria have been poorly understood. the application of 16s rrna gene sequencing in characterizing bacteraemia due to anaerobic, non-sporulating gram-positive bacilli during a 4-year period is described. the first case of olsenella uli bacteraemia, in a patient with acute cholangitis, is also reported. among 165 blood culture isolates of anaerobic, gram-positive bacilli, 75 were identified as propionibacterium acnes by phenotypic tests and 21 as members of other anaerobic, non-sporulating gram-positive bacilli by 16s rrna gene sequencing. of these 96 isolates, 16 (17 %) were associated with cases of clinically significant bacteraemia, among which 10 (63 %) were caused by eggerthella, four (25 %) by lactobacillus and one (6 %) by each of eubacterium tenue and o. uli. five of the  10 eggerthella isolates were eggerthella lenta, whereas the other five belonged to two novel eggerthella species, with eggerthella hongkongensis being almost as  prevalent as eggerthella lenta. underlying disease in the gastrointestinal tract, isolation of eggerthella and lactobacillus, and monomicrobial bacteraemia were associated with clinically significant bacteraemia, whereas isolation of p. acnes and polymicrobial bacteraemia were associated with pseudobacteraemia. most patients with clinically significant bacteraemia had underlying diseases, with diseases in the gastrointestinal tract being most common. the overall mortality rate was 31 %. immunocompromised patients with clinically significant bacteraemia due to anaerobic, non-sporulating, gram-positive bacilli other than p. acnes should be treated with appropriate antibiotics. the unexpected frequency of isolation of eggerthella from blood cultures and its association with clinically  significant disease suggest that this genus is probably of high pathogenicity. further studies to look for specific virulence factors are warranted.
