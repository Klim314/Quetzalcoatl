antibacterial activity of 2-alkynoic fatty acids against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
the first study aimed at determining the structural characteristics needed to prepare antibacterial 2-alkynoic fatty acids (2-afas) was accomplished by synthesizing several 2-afas and other analogs in 18-76% overall yields. among all the compounds tested, the 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-hda) displayed the best overall antibacterial activity against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (mic=15.6 mug/ml), staphylococcus saprophyticus (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and bacillus cereus (mic=31.3 mug/ml), as well as against the gram-negative klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8 mug/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=125 mug/ml). in addition, 2-hda displayed significant antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) atcc 43300 (mic=15.6 mug/ml) and clinical isolates of mrsa (mic=3.9 mug/ml). no direct relationship was found between the antibacterial activity of 2-afas and their critical micelle concentration (cmc) suggesting that the antibacterial properties of these fatty acids are not mediated by micelle formation. it was demonstrated that the presence of a triple bond at c-2 and the carboxylic acid moiety in 2-afas are important for their antibacterial activity. 2-hda has the potential to be further evaluated for use in antibacterial formulations.
cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
antibacterial and antifungal activities of different parts of tribulus terrestris l. growing in iraq.
antimicrobial activity of organic and aqueous extracts from fruits, leaves and roots of tribulus terrestris l., an iraqi medicinal plant used as urinary anti-infective in folk medicine, was examined against 11 species of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans using microdilution method in 96 multiwell microtiter plates. all the extracts from the different parts of the plant showed antimicrobial activity against most tested microorganisms. the most active extract against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria was ethanol extract from the fruits with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 0.15 mg/ml against b. subtilis, b. cereus, p. vulgaris and c. diphtheriae. in addition, the same extract from the same plant part demonstrated the strongest antifungal activity against c. albicans with an mic value of 0.15 mg/ml.
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
marine algae: screening for a potent antibacterial agent.
this study was done to investigate the antimicrobial potentiality of the marine algae collected from different coastal regions of gujarat and screened for the same. twenty-six marine algae belonging to rhodophyceae, chlorophyceae and phaeophyceae were screened for their potential antibacterial activity against five clinically important bacterial strains, namely bacillus cereus, micrococcus flavus, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas testosterone. acetone and methanol were used for extraction; and the extracted yield was more when the solvent used was methanol. the antibacterial activity was done by both agar disc diffusion method and agar ditch method. the five bacterial strains showed varied response towards marine algal extracts. the most susceptible bacteria was b. cereus followed by k. pneumoniae and c. freundii while the most resistant bacteria were m. flavus and p. testosteroni. among the 26 algae screened, e. intestinalis was the most potent alga and thus, this alga was selected for further studies. e. intestinalis was extracted in petroleum ether, 1,4-dioxan, acetone, methanol and dmf, and their antibacterial activity was studied against the above-stated five bacterial strains using agar disc method. maximum extractive value of e. intestinalis was in methanol (2.05%) and minimum was in acetone (0.38%). the most susceptible bacteria was k. pneumoniae and maximum antibacterial activity was shown by petroleum ether extract and minimum was shown by 1,4-dioxan extract. the most resistant bacteria were m. flavus and c. freundii. the mic values of e. intestinalis extracts ranged from 2500-9.765 microg/0.5 ml against b. cereus and k. pneumoniae. from these results it is concluded that the acetone extract of e. intestinalis is the most potent extract and can be used as a lead molecule in drug discovery in inhibiting some of the bacterial strains. e. intestinalis can be used as a promising novel marine antimicrobial agent in the coming years.

a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
bovine lactoperoxidase (lpo) was purified with amberlite cg 50 h+ resin, cm sephadex c-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex g-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. the activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (abts) as a choromogenic substrate at ph 6.0. purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with sds-page and rz value (a412/a280). rz value for the purified lpo was 0.8. km value at ph 6.0 at 20 degrees c for the lpo was 0.20 mm. vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at ph 6.0 at 20 degrees c. bovine lpo showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mm thiocyanate--100 mm h2o2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila atcc 7966, micrococcus luteus la 2971, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, bacillus subtilis img 22, pseudomonas pyocyanea, bacillus subtilis var. niger atcc 10, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, enterococcus faecalis atcc 15753, bacillus brevis fmc3, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 5, corynebacterium xerosis uc 9165, bacillus cereus eu, bacillus megaterium nrs, yersinia enterocolytica, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, bacillus megaterium eu, bacillus megaterium dsm32, klebsiella oxytocica, staphylococcus aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis, mycobacterium smegmatis ccm 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. the lpo--100 mm thiocyanate--100 mm h2o2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and shigella dysentriae) and four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureous and streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed schiffs' bases. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from tenerife cheese: initial characterization of plantaricin tf711, a bacteriocin-like substance produced by lactobacillus plantarum tf711.
aims: the screening and initial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab) from raw tenerife goats' cheese with possible application as biopreservatives or ripening accelerators for tenerife cheese. methods and results: one hundred and eighty lab of the genera lactobacillus (95), leuconostoc (64) and lactococcus (21) isolated from raw tenerife goats' cheese were screened for the production of antimicrobial substances. lactobacillus plantarum tf711, which had the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial activity, was selected for further characterization. the antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, as it was sensitive to proteases. the bacteriocin-like substance, which we called plantaricin tf711, was active against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes and staphylococcus aureus; and against the enterobacteriaceae shigella sonnei and klebsiella pneumoniae. it was stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. highest antimicrobial activity was found between ph 1 and 9. plantaricin tf711 exhibited primary metabolite kinetics, a bacteriostatic mode of action and a molecular mass of c. 2.5 kda as determined by tricine sds-page. conclusions: lact. plantarum tf711 produces a low molecular mass bacteriocin-like compound with a wide spectrum of activity and interesting technological properties (thermostability, good ph stability and stability against surfactants and organic solvents). significance and impact of the study: plantaricin tf711 was found to have potential for use as a biopreservative in the food industry.

antibacterial activity pf various parts (stem, leaf and fruits) of solvent extracts (petroleum ether, alcohol and acetone) of solanum xanthocarpum against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi and bacillus cereus were detected by zone of inhibition. the extracts of solanum xanthocarpum showed high sensitivity to kiebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi, moderate sensitivity to escherichia coli and less sensitivity and resistant to bacillus cereus. in control, there is no inhibitory zone observed.
antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.
antimicrobial potency of the leaf - stalk extract of curcuma longa (linn).
the methanolic extract of the leaf-stalk of curcuma longa linn, was tested for its minimum inhibitor concentration (mic) against gram positive-staphylococcus aureus, bacillus pumilus, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pnemoniae, bacillus cereus, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative e.coli, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and vibrio cholerae strains, further, the ones of inhibition produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
antimicrobial activities of several parts of pinus brutia, juniperus oxycedrus, abies cilicia, cedrus libani and pinus nigra.
in this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the kahramanmaras region of turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of pinus brutia ten., juniperus oxycedrus l., abies cilicia ant. & kotschy carr., cedrus libani a. rich. and pinus nigra arn. were prepared and tested against bacillus megaterium dsm 32, bacillus subtilis img 22, bacillus cereus fmc 19, escherichia coli dm, klebsiella pneumoniae fmc 3, enterobacter aerogenes ccm 2531, staphylococcus aureus cowan 1, mycobacterium smegmatis rut, proteus vulgaris fmc 1, listeria monocytogenes scoot a, pseudomonas aeruginosa dsm 5007, candida albicans ccm 314, candida tropicalis mdc 86 and penicillium italicum k. the results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, e. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of a. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. all the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. when the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. on the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per ml. staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. for gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and xanthomonas maltophilia, mics were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. the microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. b. cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. however, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. the disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.
antibacterial activity of helichrysum aureonitens (asteraceae).
the antibacterial activity of extracts from helichrysum aureonitens was investigated. the dichloromethane extract was active against all five gram positive bacteria tested and the methanol extract was active only against bacillus cereus, b. pumilus and micrococcus kristinae, while the water extract had no activity against any of the organisms. none of the extracts inhibited the growth of the five gram negative bacteria tested.
relationship between selected bacteria and the growth of immature house flies, musca domestica, in an axenic test system.
to investigate the relationship between immature (maggot) house flies, musca domestica, and bacteria, we compared the development of sterile first-instar maggots in each of 10 pure blood agar cultures of bacteria with growth on sterile blood agar (negative control) and on standard house fly rearing medium (positive control). nine species of bacteria representing gram-negative and gram-positive rods, coccoid, and micrococcoid cell types supported house fly growth on blood agar. one bacterium, a strain of bacillus cereus, inhibited maggot growth. the percent pupation for maggots that developed in the presence of eight of nine bacteria (range, 41-69%), was significantly greater than in sterile blood agar (0-5%), and did not differ significantly from maggot growth in the rearing medium (50-90%). average pupal weight for maggots that developed on blood agar with bacteria ranged from 19 to 21 mg, a reflection of favorable growth conditions. average pupal weight in the presence of three bacteria (19.9, 19.4, and 19.4 mg) was significantly less than respective pupal weights in house fly rearing medium (24.0, 22.3, and 22.1 mg), but there was no difference in average pupal weight with six bacteria and the house fly rearing medium. these findings illustrate that bacteria or their metabolic products are essential as nutrients for house fly maggot growth in blood agar; a wide variety of adventitious bacteria can contribute to the suitability of an organic substrate for maggot growth; and a naturally occurring isolate of b. cereus limits house fly maggot growth in blood agar, a relationship that has not been reported previously.
