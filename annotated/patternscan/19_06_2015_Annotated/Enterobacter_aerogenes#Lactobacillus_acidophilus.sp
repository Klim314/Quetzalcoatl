TI  == a food additive with prebiotic properties of an alpha-d-glucan from lactobacillus plantarum dm5.
AB  == an alpha-d-glucan produced by lactobacillus plantarum dm5 was explored for in vitro prebiotic activities. glucan-dm5 demonstrated 21.6% solubility, 316.9% water holding capacity, 86.2% flocculation activity, 71.4% emulsification activity and a degradation temperature (td) of 292.2 degrees c. glucan-dm5 exhibited lowest digestibility of 0.54% by artificial gastric juice, 0.21% by intestinal fluid and 0.32% by alpha-amylase whereas the standard prebiotic inulin, showed 25.23%, 5.97% and 19.13%, hydrolysis, respectively. prebiotic activity assay of glucan-dm5 displayed increased growth of probiotic bacteria such as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus, but did not support the growth of non-probiotic bacteria such as escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. the overall findings indicated that glucan from l. plantarum dm5 can serve as a potential prebiotic additive for food products.
