TI  == carbohydrate and ethane release with erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum--induced necrosis.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum, also known as e. betavasculorum and pectobacterium betavasculorum, is a soil bacterium that has the capacity to cause root rot necrosis of sugarbeets. the qualitatively different pathogenicity exhibited by the virulent e. carotovora strain and two avirulent strains, a citrobacter sp. and an enterobacter cloacae, was examined using digital analysis  of photographic evidence of necrosis as well as for carbohydrate, ethane, and ethylene release compared with uninoculated potato tuber slices. visual scoring of necrosis was superior to digital analysis of photographs. the release of carbohydrates and ethane from potato tuber slices inoculated with the soft rot necrosis-causing erwinia was significantly greater than that of potato tuber slices that had not been inoculated or that had been inoculated with the nonpathogenic e. cloacae and citrobacter sp. strains. interestingly, ethylene production from potato slices left uninoculated or inoculated with the nonpathogenic citrobacter strain was 5- to 10-fold higher than with potato slices inoculated with the pathogenic erwinia strain. these findings suggest that (1) carbohydrate release might be a useful measure of the degree of pathogenesis, or  relative virulence; and that (2) bacterial suppression of ethylene formation may  be a critical step in root rot disease formation.
