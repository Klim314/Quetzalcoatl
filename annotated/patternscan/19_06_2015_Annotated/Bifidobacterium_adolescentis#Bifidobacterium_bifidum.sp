TI  == intestinal microbiota and allergic diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == evidence suggests that possible imbalances in intestinal microbiota composition may be implicated in the occurrence of allergic diseases. although several studies published until 2006 indicated a correlation between microbiota composition and allergic symptoms, it has not been possible to distinguish protective microorganisms from those associated with increased risk of allergic diseases. therefore, the objective of this study was to review the studies published since 2007 that address the intestinal microbiota in allergic diseases. twenty-one studies were identified after excluding those that performed a clinical intervention before stool collection. in the early microbiota of children who later developed allergies, lower bacterial diversity was observed, with a predominance of firmicutes; a higher count of bacteroidaceae; a higher prevalence of the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, and  bifidobacterium longum; and a lower prevalence of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, and lactobacillus. in the microbiota of allergic children whose intestinal microbiota was assessed at the onset of allergic symptoms, there was a higher count of bacteroides; a lower count of akkermansia muciniphila, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and clostridium; a higher prevalence of b. adolescentis; a lower prevalence of b. catenulatum and staphylococcus aureus; and a lower bacterial diversity.

TI  == [application of multiplex pcr for analysis of polycomponent probiotic preparations].
AB  == aim: development of multiplex pcr for indication and differential analysis of cfu in a probiotic preparation containing 3 various species ofbifidobacteria (bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis) and 2 species of lactobacilli (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum). materials and methods; multiplex pcr with primers to 16s rna genes of 5 species of bacteria was applied. samples of bacterial colonies were removed from solid nutrient medium and transferred into test-tube for multiplex pcr execution. bacterial lysates were used as target-matrix for amplification and determination of presence of the required amplicons. results: multiplex pcr for detection of cfu of each of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains in samples of 5-component probiotic with  accuracy up to species was developed. a reagent kit was fine-tuned and high reproducibility and specificity of the multiplex pcr method with the accuracy of  90 - 95% of cases was shown. conclusion: the multiplex pcr method developed is recommended to be applied for cfu control of each bacterial component in a complex probiotic preparation.

TI  == mother-to-infant transmission of intestinal bifidobacterial strains has an impact on the early development of vaginally delivered infant's microbiota.
AB  == objectives: bifidobacterium species are one of the major components of the infant's intestine microbiota. colonization with bifidobacteria in early infancy  is suggested to be important for health in later life. however, information remains limited regarding the source of these microbes. here, we investigated whether specific strains of bifidobacteria in the maternal intestinal flora are transmitted to their infant's intestine. materials and methods: fecal samples were collected from healthy 17 mother and infant pairs (vaginal delivery: 12; cesarean section delivery: 5). mother's feces were collected twice before delivery. infant's feces were collected at 0 (meconium), 3, 7, 30, 90 days after  birth. bifidobacteria isolated from feces were genotyped by multilocus sequencing typing, and the transitions of bifidobacteria counts in infant's feces were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr. results: stains belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, were identified to be monophyletic between mother's and infant's intestine. eleven out of 12 vaginal delivered infants carried at least one monophyletic strain. the bifidobacterial counts of the species to which the monophyletic strains belong, increased predominantly in the infant's intestine within 3 days after birth. among infants delivered by c-section, monophyletic strains were not observed. moreover, the bifidobacterial counts were significantly lower than the vaginal delivered infants until 7 days of age. conclusions: among infants born vaginally, several bifidobacterium strains transmit from the mother and colonize the infant's intestine shortly after birth. our data suggest that the mother's intestine is an important source for the vaginal delivered infant's intestinal microbiota.

TI  == differential modulation of human intestinal bifidobacterium populations after consumption of a wild blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) drink.
AB  == bifidobacteria are gaining increasing interest as health-promoting bacteria. nonetheless, the genus comprises several species, which can exert different effects on human host. previous studies showed that wild blueberry drink consumption could selectively increase intestinal bifidobacteria, suggesting an important role for the polyphenols and fiber present in wild blueberries. this study evaluated the modulation of the most common and abundant bifidobacterial taxonomic groups inhabiting the human gut in the same fecal samples. the analyses carried out showed that b. adolescentis, b. breve, b. catenulatum/pseudocatelulatum, and b. longum subsp. longum were always present in the group of subjects enrolled, whereas b. bifidum and b. longum subsp. infantis  were not. furthermore, it was found that the most predominant bifidobacterial species were b. longum subsp. longum and b. adolescentis. the results obtained revealed a high interindividual variability; however, a significant increase of b. longum subsp. infantis cell concentration was observed in the feces of volunteers after the wild blueberry drink treatment. this bifidobacterial group was shown to possess immunomodulatory abilities and to relieve symptoms and promote the regression of several gastrointestinal disorders. thus, an increased  cell concentration of b. longum subsp. infantis in the human gut could be considered of potential health benefit. in conclusion, wild blueberry consumption resulted in a specific bifidogenic effect that could positively affect certain populations of bifidobacteria with demonstrated health-promoting properties.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == tolerance of bifidobacterium human isolates to bile, acid and oxygen.
AB  == bifidobacteria are part of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and are used as  probiotics in functional food products because of their health promoting properties. however, only few data are available on the phenotypic characteristics displayed by human bifidobacteria strain populations. in this study we compared the in vitro tolerance to acid, bile and oxygen of the largest  number of independent human intestinal strains. bile and acid tolerance varied among species and independent strains within a species: b. adolescentis strains were the most tolerant to bile followed by bifidobacterium longum and b. breve; b. longum, b. breve and b. dentium showed the highest viability levels after exposure to acid ph. oxygen tolerance was largely distributed among intestinal bifidobacteria: b. longum, b. breve and b. bifidum showed the highest oxygen tolerance. b. adolescentis showed the highest susceptibility to acid and oxygen stresses. the present study gave us the opportunity to update our knowledge about the phenotypic characteristics of human intestinal bifidobacteria. b. longum and  b. breve harboured the best tolerance to oxygen, bile and acid stresses. based on such biological characters, b. longum and b. breve species showed the highest interest in terms of potential selection of human probiotics.

TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == long-term changes in human colonic bifidobacterium populations induced by a 5-day oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid treatment.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the possible modifications due to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (amc) treatment on total bacteria and on bifidobacterium species balance in human colonic microbiota. eighteen healthy volunteers (19 to 36 years old) were given a 875/125 mg dose of amc twice a day for 5 days. fecal samples were obtained before and after antibiotic exposure. after total dna extraction, total bacteria and bifidobacteria were specifically quantified using real-time pcr. dominant species were monitored over time using bacterial and bifidobacterial temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). at the end of amc exposure, total bacterial concentrations as well as bifidobacteria concentrations were significantly reduced compared to before amc exposure:10.7+/-0.1 log(10) 16s rrna gene copies/g vs 11.1+/-0.1 log(10) (p = 0.003) and 8.1+/-0.5 log(10) 16s rrna gene copies/g vs 9.4+/-0.3 log(10) (p = 0.003), respectively. at the same time, the mean similarity percentages of ttge bacteria and ttge bifidobacteria profiles were significantly reduced compared to  before amc exposure: 51.6%+/-3.5% vs 81.4%+/-2.1% and 55.8%+/-7.6% vs 84.5%+/-4.1%, respectively. occurrence of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum and b. pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum species significantly decreased. occurrence of b. longum remained stable. moreover, the number of distinct bifidobacterium species per sample significantly decreased (1.5+/-0.3 vs 2.3+/-0.3; p = 0.01). two months after amc exposure, the mean similarity percentage of ttge profiles was 55.6% for bacteria and 62.3% for bifidobacteria. these results clearly demonstrated that a common antibiotic treatment may qualitatively alter the colonic microbiota. such modifications may have potential long-term physiological consequences.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == breast milk jaundice: effect of bacteria present in breast milk and infant feces.
AB  == objective: breast milk is an important source of bacteria in establishing the infantile intestinal microbiota that appear to influence the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of breast milk's microbiological content on the development of breast milk jaundice (bmj). methods: a total number of 60 mother-infant pairs enrolled to the study. two groups were defined: bmj group (n=30), full-term otherwise healthy newborns who were considered bmj; control group (n=30), full-term healthy newborns without jaundice. all newborns in the study were exclusively breast-fed. the breast milk samples and the feces of infants were evaluated for content of selected bacterial populations (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, clostridium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus species) with real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: bifidobacterium bifidum content in the breast milk and b adolescentis, b bifidum, and b longum content in the fecal samples were higher in the control group than in the bmj group. the milk and fecal concentrations of b bifidum were significantly correlated. the concentrations of breast milk b bifidum and fecal b bifidum, b adolescentis, and b longum were found to be negatively correlated with bilirubin levels. conclusions: our results suggest that bifidobacterium species in breast milk may protect against bmj.

TI  == bifidobacterial succession and correlation networks in a large unselected cohort  of mothers and their children.
AB  == bifidobacteria are a major microbial component of infant gut microbiota, which is believed to promote health benefits for the host and stimulate maturation of the  immune system. despite their perceived importance, very little is known about the natural development of and possible correlations between bifidobacteria in human  populations. to address this knowledge gap, we analyzed stool samples from a randomly selected healthy cohort of 87 infants and their mothers with >90% of vaginal delivery and nearly 100% breast-feeding at 4 months. fecal material was sampled during pregnancy, at 3 and 10 days, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years after birth. stool samples were predicted to be rich in the species bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, b. breve, and b. longum. due to high variation, we did not identify a clear age-related structure at the individual level. within the population as a whole, however, there were clear age-related successions. negative correlations between the b. longum group and b. adolescentis were detected in adults and in 1- and 2-year-old children, whereas negative correlations between b. longum and b. breve were characteristic for newborns and 4-month-old infants. the highly structured age-related development of and correlation networks between bifidobacterial species during the first 2 years of life mirrors their different or competing nutritional requirements, which in turn may be associated with specific biological functions in the development of healthy gut.

TI  == inter-species differences in the growth of bifidobacteria cultured on human milk  oligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk (hm) contains as the third most abundant component around 200 different structures of human milk oligosaccharides (hmos). hmos are the first and irreplaceable prebiotics for infants, supporting bifidobacteria as the most important bacterial group in an infant intestine. the aim of our study was to test the growth of bifidobacteria in hm and on hmos. bifidobacteria were isolated from two groups of infants. the first one (eight strains) were isolated from infants who had bifidobacteria in their feces but, after a short period of time (4 to 24 days), bifidobacteria were no longer detected in their feces (disappeared bifidobacteria [db]). the second group of bifidobacteria (eight strains) originated from infants with continual presence of bifidobacteria in their feces (persistent bifidobacteria [pb]). there were significant differences  (p < 0.05) between db and pb groups in the ability of the strains to grow in hm.  pb grew in hm, reaching counts higher than 7 log cfu/ml. in contrast, counts of db decreased from 5 to 4.3 log cfu/ml after cultivation in hm. the final ph after cultivation of bifidobacteria on hmos was 6.2 and 4.9 in dp and pb groups, respectively. in general, bifidobacterium bifidum and b. breve species were able  to utilize hmos, while b. adolescentis and b. longum subsp. longum species did not. the ability to grow in hm and to utilize hmos seem to be important properties of bifidobacteria which are able to colonize infant intestinal tract.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == bifidobacterium bifidum ncc 453 promotes tolerance induction in murine models of  sublingual immunotherapy.
AB  == background: enhancing clinical efficacy remains a major goal in allergen-specific immunotherapy. in this study, we tested three strains of bifidobacteria as candidate adjuvants for sublingual allergy vaccines. methods: probiotic candidates were evaluated in human monocyte-derived dendritic cell (h-dc) maturation and cd4(+) t-cell polarization in vitro models and further tested in murine models of sublingual immunotherapy in balb/c mice sensitized to either ovalbumin or birch pollen. results: bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum and  b. longum induced h-dc maturation and polarized naive cd4(+) t cells toward interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 production. b. bifidum increased cd25(high),  foxp3(+) cells within cd4(+) t lymphocytes and was the most potent inducer of interferon-gamma in th2-skewed peripheral blood mononuclear cells and h-dc t-cell cocultures. it also induced a significant decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness  in balb/c mice sensitized to ovalbumin. sublingual administration of b. bifidum together with recombinant bet v 1 enhanced tolerance induction in balb/c mice sensitized to birch pollen, with a downregulation of both airway hyperresponsiveness, lung inflammation and bet v 1-specific th2 responses. conclusions: due to its capacity to reorient established th2 responses toward th1/regulatory t-cell profiles, b. bifidum represents a valid candidate adjuvant  for specific immunotherapy of type i allergies.

TI  == short communication: identification and differentiation of bifidobacteria obtained from ukraine.
AB  == ten freeze-dried bifidobacterial strains used as probiotics in ukrainian dairy foods, identified by the supplier as bifidobacterium adolescentis (2), bifidobacterium bifidum (2), bifidobacterium longum (4), bifidobacterium animalis (1), and bifidobacterium infantis (1), were characterized. following rehydration  and anaerobic growth on de man, rogosa, and sharpe-cysteine medium at 37 degrees  c for 72 h, single-colony isolates were picked and evaluated using pcr primers specific for the bifidobacterium genus, for the supplier-identified species, and  for b. animalis ssp. lactis. all isolates were identified as members of the genus bifidobacterium; however, species-specific pcr revealed all 10 isolates were actually strains of b. animalis ssp. lactis. further evaluation using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was only able to separate a single strain (rt 09) from the other 9 strains evaluated. application of genome-wide allelic profiling to the ukrainian bifidobacterial strains revealed 4 distinct groups. interestingly, 6 (60%) of the isolates fell into the same cluster as that containing the common commercial probiotic strain bb-12. two of the strains (rt 02 and rt 09) were found to be in the same group as atcc 27536 and one strain (rt 08) was in the same group as the rb 7239 (a previously evaluated commercial strain). one strain, rt 04, was placed on a unique branch. these results highlight the importance of employing routine typing of bifidobacterial isolates, demonstrate the utility of single nucleotide polymorphism/insertion-deletion polymorphism-based allelic typing in b. animalis ssp. lactis strain differentiation and further point to the limited genetic variability of b. animalis ssp. lactis strains and the worldwide distribution of a small number of  commercial strains.

AB  == background: cell surface pili in gram positive bacteria have been reported to orchestrate the colonization of host tissues, evasion of immunity and the development of biofilms. so far, little if any information is available on the presence of pilus-like structures in human gut commensals like bifidobacteria. results and discussion: in this report, atomic force microscopy (afm) of various  bifidobacterial strains belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis revealed the existence of appendages resembling pilus-like structures. interestingly, these microorganisms harbour two to six predicted pilus gene clusters in their genome, with each organized in an operon encompassing the major pilin subunit-encoding gene (designated fima or fimp) together with one or two minor pilin subunit-encoding genes (designated as  fimb and/or fimq), and a gene encoding a sortase enzyme (stra). quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr analysis and rt-pcr experiments revealed a polycistronic mrna, encompassing the fima/p and fimb/q genes, which are differentially expressed upon cultivation of bifidobacteria on various glycans.

TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.

AB  == during recent years, researchers have been focusing on the concept of an infectious etiology of autoimmune diseases. the most discussed theory is molecular mimicry, i.e. the emergence of autoreactive clones of t- and b-lymphocytes as a result of cross-immune response to homologous bacterial or viral antigen. information on the role of probiotic microorganisms (pm) in the molecular mechanisms of autoimmune thyroid diseases (atd) is limited. using proteins and immunogenic peptides databanks and relevant computer programs, the homology between the amino acid sequences of thyroid peroxidase (tpo) and thyroglobulin (tg), which are potential b- and t-cell epitopes of these antigens, and proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was established. moreover, we have found components of cells of bifidobacterium bifidum 791, bifidobacterium adolescentis 94 bim, bifidobacterium longum b379m and lactobacillus plantarum b-01 that selectively bind human antibodies to tpo (anti-tpo) and antibodies to tg (anti-tg) and compete with natural antigens for the binding of anti-tpo and anti-tg in elisa. additionally, a three-fold difference was observed between the  probability of detecting antibodies (abs) to the antigens of l. plantarum b-01 and b. bifidum 791 in serum samples containing and those not containing anti-tpo. on the whole, our data are arguments in favour of the assumption of the possible  role of pm of the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in triggering atd by the mechanism of molecular mimicry. the data obtained in silico and in vitro should be proven by use of animal models and clinical studies for extrapolations  to the whole body. possible antigenic properties of components/proteins of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, selectively binding anti-tpo and anti-tg should  be taken into consideration. natural human abs to these bacterial components are  probably able to cross-react with the tpo and tg in the elisa for detection of anti-tpo and anti-tg, which are serologic markers of atd. it can lead to unspecific false positive results and, hence, to an incorrect diagnosis.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == secretor genotype (fut2 gene) is strongly associated with the composition of bifidobacteria in the human intestine.
AB  == intestinal microbiota plays an important role in human health, and its composition is determined by several factors, such as diet and host genotype. however, thus far it has remained unknown which host genes are determinants for the microbiota composition. we studied the diversity and abundance of dominant bacteria and bifidobacteria from the faecal samples of 71 healthy individuals. in this cohort, 14 were non-secretor individuals and the remainders were secretors.  the secretor status is defined by the expression of the abh and lewis histo-blood group antigens in the intestinal mucus and other secretions. it is determined by  fucosyltransferase 2 enzyme, encoded by the fut2 gene. non-functional enzyme resulting from a nonsense mutation in the fut2 gene leads to the non-secretor phenotype. pcr-dgge and qpcr methods were applied for the intestinal microbiota analysis. principal component analysis of bifidobacterial dgge profiles showed that the samples of non-secretor individuals formed a separate cluster within the secretor samples. moreover, bifidobacterial diversity (p<0.0001), richness (p<0.0003), and abundance (p<0.05) were significantly reduced in the samples from the non-secretor individuals as compared with those from the secretor individuals. the non-secretor individuals lacked, or were rarely colonized by, several genotypes related to b. bifidum, b. adolescentis and b. catenulatum/pseudocatenulatum. in contrast to bifidobacteria, several bacterial genotypes were more common and the richness (p<0.04) of dominant bacteria as detected by pcr-dgge was higher in the non-secretor individuals than in the secretor individuals. we showed that the diversity and composition of the human bifidobacterial population is strongly associated with the histo-blood group abh  secretor/non-secretor status, which consequently appears to be one of the host genetic determinants for the composition of the intestinal microbiota. this association can be explained by the difference between the secretor and non-secretor individuals in their expression of abh and lewis glycan epitopes in  the mucosa.

TI  == oligosaccharides in 4 different milk groups, bifidobacteria, and ruminococcus obeum.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to identify a link between the total amount of breast milk oligosaccharides and faecal microbiota composition of newborns at  the end of the first month of life, with special attention paid to bifidobacteria, and establish the role, if any, of the different oligosaccharides in determining the gut microbiota composition. subjects and methods: milk oligosaccharide groups were identified by high-performance anion exchange chromatography analysis. dpcrna from newborns' faecal samples at 30 days of life  was isolated and processed by polymerase chain reaction analyses that allow the identification of 6 species of bifidobacteria (adolescentis, bifidum, breve, catenulatum, longum, infantis) and ruminococcus spp; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis was also performed. results: no substantial differences  in bifidobacteria species composition within milk groups 1, 2, and 3 were observed; however, infants fed with group 4 milk show a microbiota characterised  by a greater frequency of bifidobacteria adolescentis and the absence of bifidobacteria catenulatum. for the first time, a high percentage of the ruminococcus genus in infants fed with all milk groups was found. conclusions: our data show that milk groups 1, 2, and 3, containing an amount of oligosaccharides ranging within 10 to 15 g/l, share a substantially identical composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants, despite quali-quantitative difference in oligosaccharides content. newborns taking milk with only 5 g/l of oligosaccharides (group 4) harbour a different intestinal microbiota.

TI  == predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bi-07.
AB  == the effect of probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium lactis bi-07 on the composition of the lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. the study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative pcr and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna  gene. the core population of the lactobacillus group was identified as lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. the fecal numbers of l. acidophilus and b. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. the levels of bifidobacterium correlated positively (p=0.03), while the levels of the lactobacillus group negatively (p=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. this correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. the main conclusion of the study is that administration of l. acidophilus ncfm and b. lactis bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.

TI  == molecular genetic study of species and strain variability in bifidobacteria population in intestinal microflora of breast-fed infants and their mothers.
AB  == qualitative and quantitative composition of enteric bifidoflora was studied in a  group of 13 mother-infant pairs. pure cultures of bifidobacterium strains were isolated from feces and their species were identified by pcr with species-specific primers or by partial sequencing of 16s rdna. the strains were compared by rep-pcr. the most incident bifidobacterium species in mothers were b. longum and b. adolescentis. the infants were mainly colonized by b. bifidum and b. longum. the mother and her baby were colonized by the same bifidobacterium species in 9 of 13 cases. in 5 (38.5%) of these cases, these pairs of strains were identical by their rep-pcr profiles. these strains belonged to b. longum in  one case, b. bifidum in 3 cases, and b. adolescentis in 1 case. our results support the hypothesis on early colonization of infants with maternal bifidobacterium strains.

AB  == the crude fractions of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low-molar-mass chitosans (lmwc) were prepared by enzyme hydrolysis of chitosan (cs). specific growth rate  of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis and b. longum ssp. longum was determined in the presence of 0.025 and 0.5 % cos (<5 kda), lmwc (5-10 kda), and 0.025, 0.1 and 0.5% of cs, chitosan succinate and chitosan glutamate in vitro. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic; assayed by colony counting on tpy agar plates) of cos-lmwc and cs ranged from 0.025% to 0.75% of cs-lmwc. the growth of all bifidobacterial strains in the presence of chitosan, its derivatives and lmwc decreased at a concentration of 0.025%; the bacterial growth was completely inhibited at a concentration of 0.5%. cos did not show any inhibitory effect, an increased growth rate was even observed in the case of b. bifidum, b. catenulatum and b. infantis.

TI  == dissimilarity in the occurrence of bifidobacteriaceae in vaginal and perianal microbiota in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == recent data point at the similarity between the perianal and vaginal microflora in terms of lactobacillus species involved. bacterial vaginosis, the most common  perturbation of the vaginal microflora involving primarily overgrowth of gardnerella vaginalis, has also been suggested to involve a recto-vaginal pathway. we addressed this issue with regard to bacteria of the bifidobacteriaceae family. in particular, we investigated the putative concordance of the presence of g. vaginalis and a series of bifidobacteria between the perianal and vaginal microflora in 10 patients with bacterial vaginosis through multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of desquamated epithelial cells. g. vaginalis was found in a biofilm mode of growth  at the perianal and vaginal sites. in most women at least one of the following species was detected perianally: bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breves, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. at the vaginal site, none of these bifidobacteria was found. we conclude that bacterial vaginosis does not occur as a result of simple growth per continuum of perianal bacteria. only some species originating from the intestinal tract do display pronounced vaginotropism, like g. vaginalis, whereas many other  species do not.

TI  == amoxicillin treatment modifies the composition of bifidobacterium species in infant intestinal microbiota.
AB  == objectives: amoxicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic largely used in childhood. however only few studies described its impact on composition of children gut microbiota, in particular on bifidobacterium populations considered as beneficial microorganisms. in this study, the impact on faecal bifidobacterium species of a  seven-day amoxicillin treatment was quantitatively and qualitatively assessed in  infants during an episode of acute respiratory infection. methods: faecal samples from 31 infants were obtained on day 0 (just before amoxicillin therapy) and on day 7 (the end of therapy). total dna was extracted and bifidobacteria were quantified using real-time pcr. predominant bifidobacterium species were then identified using specific pcr-ttge. results: bifidobacteria concentrations were not significantly altered by amoxicillin compared to the healthy group. however,  amoxicillin treatment induced a complete disappearance of bifidobacterium adolescentis species (occurrence rate of 0% versus 36.4% in healthy group, p < 0.001), a significant decrease in the occurrence rate of bifidobacterium bifidum  (23% versus 54.5% in healthy group, p < 0.05), but did not affect bifidobacterium longum (93.5% versus 100% in healthy group) and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum (about 55% in both groups). the number of bifidobacterium species per microbiota significantly decreased from 2.5 +/- 1 for healthy group to 1.8 +/- 0.9 for treated infants (p < 0.05). conclusions: this study showed that a 7 day amoxicillin treatment did not alter the counts of bifidobacterium. however amoxicillin can have an impact by changing the microbiota at the species level and decreased the diversity of this population.

TI  == use of d(acid)-, d(bile)-, z(acid)-, and z(bile)-values in evaluating bifidobacteria with regard to stomach ph and bile salt sensitivity.
AB  == the survival of bifidobacteria in simulated conditions of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract was studied based on the d- and z-value concept. some bifidobacterium  spp. are probiotics that improve microbial balance in the human gi tract. because they are sensitive to low ph and bile salt concentrations, their viability in the gi tract is limited. the d- and z-value approach was therefore adopted as a result of observing constant log-cell reduction (90%) when bifidobacterium spp. were exposed to these 2 different stressing factors. survivals of one strain each or 4 species of bifidobacterium was studied at ph between 3.0 and 4.5 and in ox-bile between 0.15% and 0.60% for times up to 41 h. from the d(acid)- and d(bile)-values, the order of resistance to acid and bile was b. bifidum > b. infantis > b. longum > b. adolescentis. while the former 3 strains retained high  cell viability at ph 3.5 (>5.5 log cfu/ml after 5 h) and at elevated bile salt concentration of 0.6% (>4.5 log cfu/ml after 3 h), b. adolescentis was less resistant (<3.4 log cfu/ml). the z(acid)- and z(bile)-values calculated from the  d(acid)- and d(bile)-values ranged from 1.11 to 1.55 ph units and 0.40% to 0.49%, respectively. the results suggest that the d(acid)-, d(bile)-, z(acid)-, and z(bile)-value approach could be more appropriate than the screening and selection method in evaluating survival of probiotic bacteria, and in measuring their tolerance or resistance to gastric acidity and the associated bile salt concentration in the small intestine. practical application: the evaluation of the tolerance of bifidobacteria to bile salts and low ph has been made possible by use of d- and z-value concept. the calculated z(acid)- and z(bile)-values were all fairly similar for the strains used and suggest the effect of increasing the  bile salt concentration or decreasing the ph on the d(acid)- and d(bile)-values.  this approach would be useful for predicting the suitability of bifidobacteria and other lactic acid bacteria (lab) as probiotics for use in real-life situations.

TI  == bifidobacterium suppresses ige-mediated degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia  (rbl-2h3) cells.
AB  == sixteen heat-killed bifidobacteria isolated from human intestine and a probiotic  strain lactobacillus gg were tested for their ability to influence ige-mediated degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia (rbl-2h3) cells in vitro. the bifidobacteria suppressed ige-mediated degranulation of rbl-2h3 cells by 1.6-56.4% in a strain-dependent manner. bifidobacteria from healthy infants expressed high inhibitory effects on ige-mediated degranulation (41-55%), while those from allergic infants varied greatly in their effects against degranulation. bifidobacteria taxonomically identified as bifidobacterium bifidum exhibited much stronger inhibitory effects against ige-mediated degranulation than those taxonomically identified as b. adolescentis (p < 0.05).these results indicate that the intestinal bifidobacteria might be one of factors influencing ige-mediated allergic responses.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == a versatile and scalable strategy for glycoprofiling bifidobacterial consumption  of human milk oligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains approximately 200 complex oligosaccharides believed to stimulate the growth and establishment of a protective microbiota in the infant gut. the lack of scalable analytical techniques has hindered the measurement of bacterial metabolism of these and other complex prebiotic oligosaccharides. an in vitro, multi-strain, assay capable of measuring kinetics of bacterial growth and  detailed oligosaccharide consumption analysis by fticr-ms was developed and tested simultaneously on 12 bifidobacterial strains. for quantitative consumption, deuterated and reduced human milk oligosaccharide (hmo) standards were used. a custom software suite developed in house called glycolyzer was used  to process the large amounts of oligosaccharide mass spectra automatically with (13)c corrections based on de-isotoping protocols. high growth on hmos was characteristic of bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis strains, which consumed  nearly all available substrates, while other bifidobacterial strains tested, b. longum bv. longum, b. adolescentis, b. breve and b. bifidum, showed low or only moderate growth ability. total oligosaccharide consumption ranged from a high of  87% for b. infantis jcm 7009 to only 12% for b. adolescentis atcc 15703. a detailed analysis of consumption glycoprofiles indicated strain-specific capabilities towards differential metabolism of milk oligosaccharides. this method overcomes previous limitations in the quantitative, multi-strain analysis  of bacterial metabolism of hmos and represents a novel approach towards understanding bacterial consumption of complex prebiotic oligosaccharides.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == a bifidobacterium mixed-species microarray for high resolution discrimination between intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == a genomic dna-based microarray was constructed containing over 6000 randomly cloned genomic fragments of approximately 1-2 kb from six mammalian intestinal bifidobacterium spp. including b. adolescentis, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. catenulatum, b. longum and b. pseudolongum. this bifidobacterium mixed-species (bms) microarray was used to differentiate between type strains and isolates belonging to a set of nine bifidobacterium spp. hierarchical clustering of genomic hybridization data confirmed the grouping of the bifidobacterium spp. according to the 16s rrna-based phylogenetic clusters. in addition, these genomic hybridization experiments revealed high homology between the type-strain b. animalis subsp. lactis lmg18314 and b. animalis subsp. animalis lmg10508 (79%) as well as between the type strains b. longum biotype longum lmg13197 and b. longum  biotype infantis lmg8811 (72%) - nevertheless, discrimination between these species was possible due to the high resolution output of the bms-array. in addition, it was shown that the bms-array could be used for assigning unknown bifidobacterium isolates to a species group. finally, a set of 54 diagnostic clones for bifidobacterium identification was selected and sequenced to advance the understanding of the species-related differences. remarkably, a large fraction (31%) of these was predicted to encode proteins that belong to the bifidobacterial glycobiome and another 11% had functional homology with genes involved in the protection against foreign dna. overall, the bms-microarray is a  high-resolution diagnostic tool that is able to facilitate the detection of strain- and species-specific characteristics of bifidobacteria.

TI  == isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == the objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by f6ppk (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time pcr (qrti-pcr). bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. dentium. bifidobacterial dna was detected by qrti-pcr in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16s rrna gene copies per ml. in conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.

TI  == comparison of intestinal microflora in healthy infants and infants with allergic  colitis.
AB  == twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific fish probe. infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. in healthy infants, bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by b. adolescentis (20.0), b. breve (18.2), b. bifidum (16.4), b. dentium (10.9) and b. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). bifidobacterial isolates from  two babies with allergic colitis were identified as b. longum, one child from patients group contained species b. dentium and one baby b. adolescentis. our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == bifidobacterium microbiota and parameters of immune function in elderly subjects.
AB  == faecal and serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months from 55 institutionalized elderly subjects, who were enrolled in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. participants were randomized in one of the three treatment groups: intervention (two probiotic bifidobacterium longum strains: 2c  and 46), placebo and commercial control (bifidobacterium lactis bb-12). the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota was characterized by genus and species-specific pcr. serum levels of the cytokines il-10, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. each participant harboured on average approximately three different bifidobacterial species. the most frequently detected species were b. longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum. depending on the treatment, the intervention resulted in specific changes in the levels of certain bifidobacterium species, and positive correlations were found between the different species. negative correlations were observed between the levels of bifidobacterium species and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-alpha and the regulatory cytokine il-10. the presence of faecal b. longum and bifidobacterium animalis correlated with reduced serum il-10. the anti-inflammatory tgf-beta1 levels were increased over time in all three groups, and the presence of bifidobacterium breve correlated with higher serum tgf-beta1 levels. this indicates that modulation of the faecal bifidobacterium microbiota may provide a  means of influencing inflammatory responses.

TI  == evaluation of the pcr method for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == gnotobiotic mouse immune response induced by bifidobacterium sp. strains isolated from infants.
AB  == bifidobacterium, which is a dominant genus in infants' fecal flora and can be used as a probiotic, has shown beneficial effects in various pathologies, including allergic diseases, but its role in immunity has so far been little known. numerous studies have shown the crucial role of the initial intestinal colonization in the development of the intestinal immune system, and bifidobacteria could play a major role in this process. for a better understanding of the effect of bifidobacterium on the immune system, we aimed at  determining the impact of bifidobacterium on the t-helper 1 (t(h)1)/t(h)2 balance by using gnotobiotic mice. germfree mice were inoculated with bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, whose genome is sequenced, and with nine bifidobacterium strains  isolated from infants' fecal flora. five days after inoculation, mice were killed. transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), interleukin-4 (il-4), il-10, and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) gene expressions in the ileum and ifn-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, il-4, and il-5 secretions by splenocytes cultivated for 48 h with concanavalin a were quantified. two bifidobacterium species had no effect (b. adolescentis) or little effect (b. breve) on the immune system. bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  dentium, and one b. longum strain induced t(h)1 and t(h)2 cytokines at the systemic and intestinal levels. one b. longum strain induced a t(h)2 orientation  with high levels of il-4 and il-10, both secreted by splenocytes, and of tgf-beta gene expression in the ileum. the other two strains induced t(h)1 orientations with high levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha splenocyte secretions. bifidobacterium's capacity to stimulate immunity is species specific, but its influence on the orientation of the immune system is strain specific.

TI  == bifidobacteria in feces and environmental waters.
AB  == bifidobacteria have been recommended as potential indicators of human fecal pollution in surface waters even though very little is known about their presence in nonhuman fecal sources. the objective of this research was to shed light on the occurrence and molecular diversity of this fecal indicator group in different animals and environmental waters. genus- and species-specific 16s rrna gene pcr assays were used to study the presence of bifidobacteria among 269 fecal dna extracts from 32 different animals. twelve samples from three wastewater treatment plants and 34 water samples from two fecally impacted watersheds were also tested. the species-specific assays showed that bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, and b. catenulatum had the broadest host distribution (11.9 to 17.4%), whereas b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were detected in fewer than 3% of all fecal samples. phylogenetic analysis of 356 bifidobacterial clones obtained from different animal feces showed that ca. 67% of all of the sequences clustered with cultured bifidobacteria, while the rest formed a supercluster with low sequence identity (i.e., <94%) to previously described bifidobacterium spp. the b. pseudolongum subcluster (>97% similarity) contained 53 fecal sequences from seven different animal hosts, suggesting the cosmopolitan distribution of members of this clade. in contrast, two clades containing b. thermophilum and b. boum clustered exclusively with 37 and 18 pig fecal clones, respectively, suggesting host specificity. using species-specific assays, bifidobacteria were detected in only two of the surface water dna extracts, although other fecal anaerobic bacteria were detected in these waters.  overall, the results suggest that the use of bifidobacterial species as potential markers to monitor human fecal pollution in natural waters may be questionable.

TI  == in vitro fermentability of human milk oligosaccharides by several strains of bifidobacteria.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the catabolism and fermentation of human  milk oligosaccharides (hmo) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. oligosaccharides were isolated from a pooled sample of human milk using solid-phase extraction, and then added to a growth medium as the sole source of fermentable carbohydrate. of five strains of bifidobacteria tested (bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum biovar longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium adolescentis), b. longum bv. infantis grew better, achieving triple the cell density then the other strains. b. bifidum did not reach a high cell density, yet generated free sialic acid, fucose and n-acetylglucosamine in the media, suggesting some capacity for hmo degradation. thin layer chromatography profiles of spent fermentation broth suggests substantial degradation of oligosaccharides by b. longum bv. infantis, moderate degradation by b. bifidum and little degradation by other strains. while all strains were able to individually ferment two monosaccharide constituents of hmo, glucose and galactose, only b. longum bv. infantis and b. breve were able to ferment glucosamine, fucose and sialic acid. these results suggest that as a potential prebiotic, hmo may selectively promote  the growth of certain bifidobacteria strains, and their catabolism may result in  free monosaccharides in the colonic lumen.

TI  == maternal breast-milk and intestinal bifidobacteria guide the compositional development of the bifidobacterium microbiota in infants at risk of allergic disease.
AB  == background: the sources and the impact of maternal bacteria on the initial inoculum of the intestinal microflora of newborn infants remain elusive. objective: to assess the association between maternal breast-milk and fecal bifidobacteria and infants' fecal bifidobacteria. methods: sixty-one mother-infant pairs were included, special emphasis being placed on the maternal  allergic status. bifidobacteria were analysed by a direct pcr method in fecal samples from mothers at 30-35 weeks of gestation and from infants at 1 month of age and from breast-milk samples 1 month post-partum. results: fecal bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum colonization frequencies and counts among mother-infant pairs correlated significantly (p=0.005 and 0.02 for frequencies, respectively, and p=0.002 and 0.01 for counts, respectively). only infants of allergic, atopic mothers were colonized with b. adolescentis. each of the breast-milk samples contained bifidobacteria [median 1.4 x 10(3) bacterial cells/ml; interquartile range (iqr) 48.7-3.8 x 10(3)]. bifidobacterium  longum was the most frequently detected species in breast-milk. allergic mothers  had significantly lower amounts of bifidobacteria in breast-milk compared with non-allergic mothers [median 1.3 x 10(3) bacterial cells/ml (iqr 22.4-3.0 x 10(3)) vs. 5.6 x 10(3) bacterial cells/ml (1.8 x 10(3)-1.8 x 10(4)), respectively, (p=0.004)], and their infants had concurrently lower counts of bifidobacteria in feces [3.9 x 10(8) bacterial cells/g (iqr 6.5 x 10(6)-1.5 x 10(9)) in infants of allergic mothers, vs. 2.5 x 10(9) bacterial cells/g (6.5 x 10(8)-3.2 x 10(10)) in infants of non-allergic mothers, p=0.013]. conclusions: breast-milk contains significant numbers of bifidobacteria and the maternal allergic status further deranges the counts of bifidobacteria in breast-milk. maternal fecal and breast-milk bifidobacterial counts impacted on the infants' fecal bifidobacterium levels. breast-milk bacteria should thus be considered an important source of bacteria in the establishment of infantile intestinal microbiota.

TI  == molecular cloning and comparative analysis of four beta-galactosidase genes from  bifidobacterium bifidum ncimb41171.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum ncimb41171 carries four genes encoding different beta-galactosidases. one of them, named bbgiii, consisted of an open reading frame of 1,935 amino acid (a.a.) residues encoding a protein with a multidomain structure, commonly identified on cell wall bound enzymes, having a signal peptide, a membrane anchor, fivar domains, immunoglobulin ig-like and discoidin-like domains. the other three genes, termed bbgi, bbgii and bbgiv, encoded proteins of 1,291, 689 and 1,052 a.a. residues, respectively, which were  most probably intracellularly located. two cases of protein evolution between strains of the same species were identified when the a.a. sequences of the bbgi and bbgiii were compared with homologous proteins from b. bifidum dsm20215. the homologous proteins were found to be differentiated at the c-terminal a.a. part either due to a single nucleotide insertion or to a whole dna sequence insertion, respectively. the bbgiv gene was located in a gene organisation surrounded by divergently transcribed genes putatively for sugar transport (galactoside-symporter) and gene regulation (laci-transcriptional regulator), a structure that was found to be highly conserved in b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, suggesting optimal organisation shared amongst those species.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bifidobacterial microbiota in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == aim: to characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis. methods: a sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for their condition.  bacterial dna was extracted from the resected mucosal samples and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative pcr. results: bifidobacteria were found in  100% of the samples from patients with diverticulitis or ibd and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. the species b. longum and b. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by b. animalis, b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis. b. breve, b.  dentium and b. angulatum were not detected in any sample. a significantly higher  occurrence of b. longum was observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or ibd (100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, p < 0.05). similar results were obtained for b. animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, p < 0.05), while  b. adolescentis was only found in the mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). at the quantitative level, patients with colon cancer or ibd showed lower counts of total bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, p < 0.05) and of the species b. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, p < 0.05) than those with diverticulitis. conclusion: aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different intestinal diseases. this may indicate a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

AB  == aim: to develop real-time quantitative pcr methods, based on the use of probes labelled with a stable fluorescent lanthanide chelate, for the quantification of  different human faecal bifidobacterial populations. methods and results: the designed quantitative pcr assays were found to be specific for the corresponding  bifidobacterium species or groups (bifidobacterium longum group, bifidobacterium  catenulatum group, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium).  the detection limits of the methodologies used ranged between 2 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(3) cells g(-1) of faeces. the applicability of the developed assays was tested by analysing 20 human faecal samples. bif. longum group was found to be the qualitatively and quantitatively predominant bifidobacterial group. conclusions:  the real-time pcr procedures developed here are specific, accurate, rapid and easy methods for the quantification of bifidobacterium groups or species in human faecal samples. significance and impact of the study: the developed procedures will facilitate rapid and objective counting of large numbers of samples increasing our knowledge on the role of gut bifidobacterial microbiota in health  and disease. this will contribute to the efficient use of intestinal bacterial assays in research, food and pharmaceutical development as well as in the assessment of dietary management of diseases.

TI  == selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. the object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. recovered substrates were extensively washed and the  remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. the substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster xiva bacteria, including uncultured relatives of clostridium hathewayi, eubacterium rectale and roseburia species. bacteroides species were also detected. the most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species ruminococcus bromii, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve and e. rectale. the most commonly recovered sequences from  mucin were from bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to ruminococcus lactaris. this study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is  likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. for a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.

AB  == twenty-one healthy bottle-fed infants were screened monthly (1-4 months) for bifidobacteria in their stools. bifidobacteria were detected by culture and isolates specified by pcr. alternatively, direct pcr in undiluted fecal suspensions was carried out for detection of bifidobacteria under the cultural detection level. all infants harbored cultivable bifidobacteria throughout the study period. beerens medium was shown to permit a better recovery of bifidobacteria than mrs and horse blood columbia agar. direct pcr detection proved valuable in detecting species for which no cultural isolate could be recovered since the species were under the cultural detection level. b. bifidum,  b. longum-infantis and b. breve were confirmed as dominant and stable species in  infant stools while b. adolescentis and b. catenulatum group exhibited unstable colonization profiles. a trend towards b. breve decrease began at month 3 while carriage of the b. catenulatum group and b. adolescentis was rising. this observation warrants further analysis to assess a possible switch occurring at month 3 in bottle-fed infants, between so-called infant and adult bifidobacterial species.

TI  == population dynamics of bifidobacterium species in human feces during raffinose administration monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry.
AB  == the population dynamics of bifidobacteria in human feces during raffinose administration were investigated at the species level by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) coupled with flow cytometry (fcm) analysis. although double-staining fish-fcm using both fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) and indodicarbocyanine (cy5) as labeling dyes for fecal samples has been reported, the analysis was interfered with by strong autofluorescence at the fitc fluorescence region because of the presence of autofluorescence particles/debris  in the fecal samples. we circumvented this problem by using only cy5 fluorescent  dye in the fish-fcm analysis. thirteen subjects received 2 g of raffinose twice a day for 4 weeks. fecal samples were collected, and the bifidobacterial populations were monitored using the established fish-fcm method. the results showed an increase in bifidobacteria from about 12.5% of total bacteria in the prefeeding period to about 28.7 and 37.2% after the 2-week and 4-week feeding periods, respectively. bifidobacterium adolescentis, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and bifidobacterium longum were the major species, in that order, at the prefeeding period, and these bacteria were found to increase nearly in parallel during the raffinose administration. during the feeding periods, indigenous bifidobacterial populations became more diverse, such that minor species in human adults, such as bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bifidobacterium dentium, and bifidobacterium angulatum, proliferated. four weeks  after raffinose administration was stopped, the proportion of each major bifidobacterial species, as well as that of total bifidobacteria, returned to approximately the original values for the prefeeding period, whereas that of each minor species appeared to differ considerably from its original value. to the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear demonstration of the population dynamics of indigenous bifidobacteria at the species level in response to raffinose administration.

TI  == bifidobacterium species isolated from animal feces and from beef and pork meat.
AB  == bifidobacteria were isolated from 122 of 145 samples of animal feces (from cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, chickens, geese, and pigeons) from  farms in france and austria and from 92 of 955 production and processing chain samples of beef and pork (obtained at slaughter, cutting, and retail). bacterial  strains were identified to species by phenotypic numerical classification based on api 50ch and id 32a tests and dna-dna hybridization. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was present in 81% (99 of 122 samples) of all bifidobacterium-positive fecal samples and predominated in samples from all animal species except those from swine from austria. in these austrian swine samples, the majority of strains were identified as bifidobacterium thermophilum  (78%), followed by b. pseudolongum (48%). the distribution of b. thermophilum and b. pseudolongum differed significantly between austrian swine and cattle samples  such as those collected along beef and pork production and processing chains. bifidobacterium animalis was isolated from swine feces, and bifidobacterium ruminantium was isolated from cow dung. six fecal isolates (from cattle, swine, rabbits, goats, and horses) were identified as belonging to bifidobacterium species of predominantly human origin: b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, and b. catenulatum. only one other species, bifidobacterium choerinum, was detected with low frequency in a pork processing chain. b. pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum was predominant in pig feces, whereas b. pseudolongum subsp. globosum was predominant in feces from other animal species. four strains closely related to both subspecies (58 to 61% dna reassociation) formed a distinct genomic group. pcr techniques, which are more rapid and sensitive than culture-based methods, could  be used to detect directly b. pseudolongum and b. thermophilum as indicators of fecal contamination along the meat processing chain.

AB  == in this study, a competitive pcr was developed to estimate the quantity of bifidobacteria in human faecal samples using two 16s rrna gene bifidobacterium genus-specific primers, bif164f and bif662r. a pcr-temporal temperature gradient  gel electrophoresis (ttge) with the same primers also allowed us to describe the  bifidobacterium species present in these faecal samples. the pcr product obtained from the competitor had 467 bp, and was 47 bp shorter than the pcr products obtained from bifidobacterium strains. the number of bifidobacterial cells was linear from 10 to 10(8) cells per pcr assay. taking into account the dilutions of the extracted dna, the linear range was over 8 x 10(5) bifidobacteria g(-1) of faeces. reproducibility was assessed from 10 independent dna extractions from the same stool and the coefficient of variation was 0.5%. when the competitive pcr was compared with the culture method, a similar count of seven out of nine bifidobacterium pure cultures were obtained, or had a difference inferior or equal to 1 log(10). in faecal samples, the enumeration of bifidobacterium genus in most cases gave higher results with competitive pcr than with culture on selective columbia-beerens agar ph 5 (p < 0.05). in conclusion, this competitive  pcr allows a rapid, highly specific and reproducible quantification of bifidobacterium genus in faecal samples. ttge fragments co-migrating with b. longum cip64.63 fragment were found in 10 out of 11 faecal samples. bifidobacterium adolescentis and b. bifidum were detected in five out of 11 subjects. thus, cpcr and pcr-ttge can be associated in order to characterize human faecal bifidobacteria.

TI  == [isolation and comparative analysis of glycolipid fractions in bifidobacteria].
AB  == a comparative tlc analysis of lipid extracts from bifidobacterium longum b 379 m, b. bifidum 791, and b. adolescentis 94 bim has been performed. it is demonstrated that carbohydrate-containing lipid components were present in the bacteria, which differed in their chromatographic mobility (rf) from similar compounds isolated from actinomycetes stomatococcus mucilaginosus pcm 2415t, nocardiopsis dassonvillei pcm 2492, propionibacterium propionicum pcm 2431, saccharopolyspora  hirsuta pcm 2279 (= atcc 27875t), rhodococcus equi pcmt 559 (= atcc 3969), and gordonia bronchialis pcm 2167. polar lipids of bifidobacteria exhibited the closest similarity to their counterparts from propionic acid bacteria. preparative chromatography (silica gel column i; elution with chloroform, acetone, and methanol) of the lipid extract of b. adolescentis 94 bim made it possible to isolate fractions containing nonpolar lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids. further purification of the glycolipid fraction (column ii; eluant, methanol gradient in chloroform) produced preparations of glycolipids and phospholipids. the preparations were studied by two-dimensional tlc using solvent systems chloroform-methanol-h2o mili q (65 : 25 : 4, v/v/v) and n-butanol-acetic  acid-h2o mili q (60 : 20 : 20, v/v/v) for directions i and ii, respectively. two  major glycolipids were revealed (g1 and g2), in addition to compounds characteristic of the polar lipid group and minor glycolipids (g), the latter being present in considerably lesser amounts.

TI  == [analysis of bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut via temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge)].
AB  == temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge) method combined with 16s rdna clone library profiling was used to analyze bifidobacteria spp. composition in human gut in this study. bifidobacteria group-specific tgge patterns of 10 healthy human individuals showed that the bifidobacteria population in humans was host-specific. the genomic diversity and species composition of bifidobacteria in different individual was dissimilar. through sequencing and tgge comigration analysis of the bifidobacteria group-specific amplicons for one healthy boy, it was revealed that the tgge bands of this individual represented species bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. pseudocatenulatum and one potentially new species, respectively. b. pseudocatenulatum was the most common species of tested samples. while as control, only two species- b. pseudocatenulatum and b. longum were isolated using traditional culture method. bifidobacteria group-specific pcr based tgge method combined with 16s rdna clone library profiling is a sensitive and effective approach to resolve the population structure of bifidobacteria in microflora of human intestinal tract.

TI  == conditions affecting cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria.
AB  == the cell surface properties of human intestinal bifidobacteria have been characterized for 30 strains isolated from a fecal sample. strain identification  to the species level was obtained by restriction analysis of the amplified 16s rrna gene and confirmed by dna/dna reassociation experiments. the isolates were grouped in four genetically homogeneous clusters whose members belonged to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum species. cell surface properties of bifidobacterium strains were evaluated by determining the level of hydrophobicity, adhesion to hydrocarbons and contact angle measurements, and their autoaggregation ability. the results showed high and homogeneous level of hydrophobicity in all tested strains when contact angle measurements values were  considered. on the contrary, autoaggregation assays and bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons detected interesting differences in cell surface properties among the tested bifidobacterium strains. the highest levels of autoaggregation, detected in b. bifidum and b. adolescentis strains, were strictly dependent on the ph of the medium. moreover, protease treatment experiments suggested that proteins had a key role in the autoaggregating ability of b. bifidum and b. adolescentis strains.

TI  == [analysis of the probiotic bifidobacterium and lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  == to investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16s rdna sequencing and homology analysis. for identification of the key probiotics such as bifidobacterium and lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers im26/im3 and l159/l677 for pcr amplification of partial 16s  rdna were used. the results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in  feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected  at levels of 10(7) cfu/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and  85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. in addition, b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. infantis and  b. thermacidophium have also been found. l. mucosae, l. fermentum, l. salivarius, l. ruminis, l. gasseri and l. plantarum are isolated from the stools. l. mucosae  (3.68 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and l. fermentum (3.97 log10 cfu/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of lactobacillus. study on chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.

TI  == genetic diversity of viable, injured, and dead fecal bacteria assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and 16s rrna gene analysis.
AB  == a novel approach combining a flow cytometric in situ viability assay with 16s rrna gene analysis was used to study the relationship between diversity and activity of the fecal microbiota. simultaneous staining with propidium iodide (pi) and syto bc provided clear discrimination between intact cells (49%), injured or damaged cells (19%), and dead cells (32%). the three subpopulations were sorted and characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna gene amplicons obtained from the total and bifidobacterial communities. this analysis revealed that not only the total community but also the distinct subpopulations are characteristic for each individual. cloning and sequencing of the dominant bands of the dgge patterns showed that most of clones  retrieved from the live, injured, and dead fractions belonged to clostridium coccoides, clostridium leptum, and bacteroides. we found that some of the butyrate-producing related bacteria, such as eubacterium rectale and eubacterium  hallii, were obviously viable at the time of sampling. however, amplicons affiliated with bacteroides and ruminococcus obeum- and eubacterium biforme-like  bacteria, as well as butyrivibrio crossotus, were obtained especially from the dead population. furthermore, some bacterial clones were recovered from all sorted fractions, and this was especially noticeable for the clostridium leptum cluster. the bifidobacterial phylotypes identified in total samples and sorted fractions were assigned to bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum,  bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, and bifidobacterium  bifidum. phylogenetic analysis of the live, dead, and injured cells revealed a remarkable physiological heterogeneity within these bacterial populations; b. longum and b. infantis were retrieved from all sorted fractions, while b. adolescentis was recovered mostly from the sorted dead fraction.

TI  == bifidobacterial lipoglycan as a new cause for false-positive platelia aspergillus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity.
AB  == we previously hypothesized that a lipoglycan of bifidobacterium bifidum subsp. pennsylvanicum cross-reacts with the platelia aspergillus (pa) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) based on the presence of galactofuranosyl epitopes in the cell wall (m. a. s. h. mennink-kersten, r. r. klont, a. warris, h. j. m. op den camp, and p. e. verweij, lancet 363:325-327, 2004). we tested this hypothesis by testing bacterial suspensions of different bifidobacterial species and other gram-positive and -negative bacteria with the pa elisa, which is used to detect circulating galactomannan for the serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. furthermore, neonatal fecal samples were enumerated for bifidobacteria by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and tested for pa elisa reactivity. all bifidobacteria, except b. infantis and b. adolescentis, showed reactivity 6- to 600-fold higher compared to the controls (i.e., micrococcus luteus and propionibacterium freudenreichii, which contain a cell wall lipomannan). eggerthella lenta showed a 25-fold-higher reactivity. elisa reactivity was clearly shown to be associated with bacterial lipoglycans containing a beta-1,5-galactofuranosyl chain. all neonatal feces showed pa elisa reactivity and associated numbers of bifidobacteria. since high concentrations of bifidobacteria are present in the human gut, these bacteria or excreted lipoglycan may cause false serum pa elisa reactivity in selected patient groups,  especially neonates.

TI  == rapid identification of potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s rrna.
AB  == this study aimed at developing a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  primer set for identification of the potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species b. adolescentis, b. animalis subsp. animalis (b. animalis), b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum biovar infantis (b. infantis), b. animalis subsp. lactis b. lactis, b. longum biovar longum (b. longum) and b. pseudolongum. the primer set comprised specific and conserved primers and was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna genes and the rrna intergenic spacer region (isr) of each species. it could detect and identify type strains and isolates from pharmaceuticals or dairy products corresponding to the eight bifidobacterium species with high specificity. it was also useful for screening of the related strains from natural sources such as the gastro-intestinal tract and feces. we suggest that the assay system from this study is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of bifidobacterium species for which probiotic  strains are known.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr assays to identify and quantify fecal bifidobacterium  species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == a healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the  infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different bifidobacterium species. it has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific bifidobacterium species than healthy infants. for the accurate quantification of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples, duplex 5' nuclease assays  were developed. the assays, targeting rrna gene intergenic spacer regions, were validated and compared with conventional pcr and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. the 5' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (osf). a breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference. the results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria (54.8% +/- 9.8% to 73.4% +/- 4.0%) in infants receiving the prebiotic formula (osf), with a diversity of bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis (2.71% +/- 1.92% and 8.11% +/- 4.12%, respectively, versus 0.15% +/- 0.11% and 1.38% +/- 0.98% for the osf group). in conclusion, the specific prebiotic infant  formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of  breast-fed infants also at the level of the different bifidobacterium species.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting activity of anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid and lapachol identified in the inner bark of taheebo, tabebuia impetiginosa, toward 10 human intestinal bacteria was evaluated by using a paper disk diffusion bioassay and compared to those of seven lapachol congeners (1,4-naphthoquinone, naphthazarin,  menadione, lawsone, plumbagin, juglone, and dichlone) as well as two commercially available antibiotics, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. anthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid exhibited very strong growth inhibition of clostridium paraputrificum at 1 microg/disk while 100 microg/disk of lapachol was needed for moderate growth inhibition of the same organism. these two isolates exhibited weak inhibition of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli at 100  microg/disk while no adverse effects were observed on the growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium infantis,  lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei at 1000 microg/disk. structure-activity relationships indicate that a methyl group in the c-2 position of 1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives might play an important role in antibacterial activity.

TI  == variation of microbiological and biochemical parameters in the faeces of two healthy people over a 15 day period.
AB  == background: recent years have seen increasing interest in the complex microbial ecosystem of the human gastrointestinal tract. knowledge of its microbial colonists and their beneficial/detrimental activities is important. however, generalized assumptions about the microbial composition of the human gut should be taken with caution until more studies in different human communities have been conducted. the capacity of modulating or inhibiting harmful populations through high doses of beneficial microorganisms (probiotics) is now an attractive possibility. aims: the aim of this study was to determine the daily variation in  the most prominent and representative of the cultivable microbial populations in  the faeces of two healthy spanish persons, with special reference to the lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and bifidobacteria). faecal enzymatic activities caused or modulated by gut microorganisms were also examined. methods: microbial  populations were enumerated in selective and differential media. lab species isolated from mrs agar plates were further identified by phenotypic and genetic techniques. enzymatic activities were measured by the semi quantitative method of the api zym system. results: obligate anaerobes (members of the clostridium clusters and species of bacteroides and bifidobacteria) made up the largest bacterial populations in both individuals (ranging between 10(10)-10(11) cfu/g of faeces) and remained constant over time. lactobacilli species were found at an intermediate level (around 10(8) cfu/g), and yeasts and moulds, staphylococci, enterococci, coliforms and enterobacteriaceae at a lower level (between 10(3) to  10(6) cfu/g). 38 lactic acid bacteria strains identified belonged to bifidobacterium bifidum [19], bifidobacterium longum [7], bifidobacterium adolescentis [7] and lactobacillus ruminis [5] species. enzymatic profiles and values were shown to be personal and stable, but inter-sample fluctuations were recorded. conclusions: the dominant microbial populations in the faeces of the two persons were similar and stable during the sampling period. large differences were found in the lactic acid bacterial composition of each individual. biochemistry seemed to be also personal and stable over time.

AB  == aims: the aim of the present study was to compare several molecular methods for the identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria, and further to investigate genetic heterogeneity and functional properties of bifidobacterial isolates from  intestinal samples of finnish adult subjects. methods and results: a total of 153 intestinal bifidobacterial isolates were included in initial screening and 34 isolates were further characterized. identification results obtained with pcr-elisa and ribotyping were well in accordance with each other, while randomly  amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) gave tentative identification only to bifidobacterium bifidum and to 65% of the b. longum isolates. the most commonly detected species were b. longum biotype longum followed by b. adolescentis and b. bifidum. in addition, b. animalis (lactis), b. angulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum were found. ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) proved to be discriminatory methods for bifidobacteria, but also rapd revealed intraspecies heterogeneity. besides two b. animalis (lactis) isolates with very close similarity to a commercially available probiotic strain, none of the intestinal isolates showed optimal survival in all tolerance (acid, bile and oxygen) or growth performance tests. conclusions: several species/strains of bifidobacteria  simultaneously colonize the gastrointestinal tract of healthy finnish adults and  intestinal bifidobacterium isolates were genetically heterogeneous. functional properties of bifidobacteria were strain-dependent. significance and impact of the study: applicability of ribotyping with the automated riboprinter system for  identification and genotyping of bifidobacteria was shown in the present study.

TI  == genus- and species-specific pcr primers for the detection and identification of bifidobacteria.
AB  == 16srdna-targeted genus- and species-specific pcr primers have been developed and  used for the identification and detection of bifidobacteria. these primers cover  all of the described species that inhabit the human gut, or occur in dairy products. identification of cultured bifidobacteria using pcr primer pairs is rapid and accurate, being based on nucleic acid sequences. detection of bifidobacteria can be achieved using dna extracted from human faeces as template  in pcr reactions. we have found that, in adult faeces, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group was the most commonly detected species, followed by bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium bifidum. in breastfed infants, bifidobacterium breve was the most frequently detected species, followed by bifidobacterium infantis, b. longum and b. bifidum. it was notable that the b. catenulatum group was detected with the highest frequency in adults, although it has often been reported that b. adolescentis is  the most common species. real-time, quantitative pcr using primers targeting 16s  rdna shows promise in the enumeration of bifidobacteria in faecal samples. the approach to detect the target bacteria with quantitative pcr described in this review will contribute to future studies of the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microflora.

TI  == multiplex pcr using 16s rrna gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  == three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) targeted on bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. the selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. three to four pairs were gathered in one pcr reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using dna from 26 reference strains. using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, b. bifidum, b. longum and b. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum continuum and b. longum species were predominant in adults. thus, a single pcr can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of pcr reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in dna extracts from  human stools.

AB  == the adhesive property to the intestinal mucin of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512, b. longum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. adhesive rate of lkm512 to the mucin was significantly (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001) stronger than the other strains from 2 to 100 time. though the adhesive property  of many strains was almost same to the mucin of 20-year-old and 50-year-old generations, in case of 4-month-old was different. adhesive inhibitory effect of  c. perfringens to the mucin by lkm512 was examined. under the condition that lkm512 was 108/ml and that c. perfringens was 106/ml, adhesion of c. perfringens  to the mucin was inhibited at 99.6%, when lkm512 adhered in advance. there was the strong inhibition of adhesion at 74.0%, when c. perfringens adhered to mucin  in advance. thus, lkm512 can inhibit the adhesion of harmful bacteria to the intestinal mucin, the possibility of using as a probiotic strain has to be verified.

TI  == effect of honey on the growth of and acid production by human intestinal bifidobacterium spp.: an in vitro comparison with commercial oligosaccharides and inulin.
AB  == five human intestinal bifidobacterium spp., b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, and b. infantis, were cultured in reinforced clostridial medium (control) and in reinforced clostridial medium supplemented with 5% (wt/vol) honey, fructooligosaccharide (fos), galactooligosaccharide (gos), and inulin. inoculated samples were incubated anaerobically at 37degrees c for 48 h. samples  were collected at 12-h intervals and examined for specific growth rate. levels of fermentation end products (lactic and acetic acids) were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. honey enhanced the growth of the five cultures much like fos, gos, and inulin did. honey, fos, gos, and inulin were especially effective (p < 0.05) in sustaining the growth of these cultures after  24 h of incubation as compared with the control treatment. overall, the effects of honey on lactic and acetic acid production by intestinal bifidobacterium spp.  were similar to those of fos, gos, and inulin.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
AB  == among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an  impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity  against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak  or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis,  b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.

AB  == an investigation of the physiological and biochemical characteristics of the bifidobacterium bifidum no. 1, b. adolescentis mc-42, and b. adolescentis 94-bim  strains showed that bifidobacteria with a higher growth rate produced greater amounts of the end fermentation products, acetate and lactate. the growth of the  strains in batch cultures was found to be inhibited by acidic fermentation products. the growth of b. bifidum no. 1 in a batch mode lasted 100 h at a population density of 10(6) cfu/ml and the growth of b. adolescentis mc-42 and 94-bim lasted 96-120 h at population densities from 10(4) to 10(7) cfu/ml. analysis of the bifidobacterial populations by light and electron microscopy showed that they represent conglomerates of cells with lysed cytoplasm in the cell center and intact cytoplasm in the apical parts of the cells. the maximum production of extra-cellular and cell-bound proteinases was observed in the logarithmic growth phase. by the 120th h of cultivation, the metabolic activity of cells, the production of proteinases, and the protein content of bifidobacterial cultures considerably decreased. in the first, second, and third  subcultures of 96-h-old bifidobacterial cells on fresh nutrient media, the population density of bifidobacteria and their normal physiological and biochemical characteristics were restored after 48 to 72 h of cultivation.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == adhesion of bifidobacterium spp. to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == twenty-four bifidobacterium strains were examined for their ability to bind to immobilized human and bovine intestinal mucus glycoproteins. each of the tested bacteria exhibited its characteristic adhesion to human and bovine fecal mucus. no significant differences were found among the taxonomic species. among the tested bacteria, b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum adhered to human fecal mucus better than bovine fecal mucus, while the binding of b. animalis and  b. lactis was not preferential. these results suggest that the mucosal adhesive properties of bifidobacteria may be a strain dependent feature, and the mucosal binding of the human bifidobacteria may be more host specific.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == comparison of mucosal adhesion and species identification of bifidobacteria isolated from healthy and allergic infants.
AB  == fifty bifidobacteria strains were isolated from fecal samples of allergic and age matched healthy infants. allergic infants were found to have an adult type bifidobacterium flora with high levels of bifidobacterium adolescentis. healthy infants had a typical infant bifidobacterium flora with high levels of bifidobacterium bifidum. these isolates were tested for their adhesive properties to human intestinal mucus. the adhesion of the fecal bifidobacteria from healthy  infants was significantly higher (p<0.0001) than for allergic infants. this suggests a correlation between allergic disease and the composition of the intestinal bifidobacteria flora which has reduced adhesive abilities to the intestinal mucus. therefore, dietary supplementation of bifidobacteria typical for healthy infants, may be beneficial in the treatment of allergic disorders.

AB  == regularities in the development of bifidobacterial populations were studied at cellular and subcellular levels. the population development of bifidobacterium adolescentis mc-42 and b. bifidum no. 1 was shown to be accompanied by morphological cell differentiation. a scheme of morphological transformations of  bifidobacterial cells in the developmental cycle of populations is proposed. multiplication occurs via reversion of transitory rod-shaped and coccoid forms into repeatedly budding and dichotomously branching multiseptate filaments, which, under certain conditions, fragment with the formation of differentiated reproductive forms. the morphological differentiation of bifidobacterial cells in the developmental cycle of populations correlates with changes in the cell ultrastructure. physiologically active proliferating cells contain an intracyto-plasmic mesosomal complex, chains of polyribosomes connected with membrane structures, and abundant polyphosphate and polyglucoside inclusions. bifidobacterial populations are highly organized mycelium-type structures, whose  integrity is provided for by the cohesion of the cells. intercellular contacts are accomplished via cell wall fusion, capsules, and cordlike and globular structures.

AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).

TI  == [architectonics of bifidobacteria populations: submicroscopic aspect of cell cohesion in bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium bifidum].
AB  == populations (cultures) of bifidobacterium adolescents and b. bifidum, growing on  artificial liquid and agar media, are presented by highly ordered mycelial structures. the topography of them depends on mutual arrangement of polymorphic cells and the way of their daughter cells separation after division. evidences obtained by scanning electron microscopy (sem) of total preparations and by transmission electron microscopy (tem) of ultrathin sections correlate well. these data showed the existence of morphologically varied intercellular contacts  (coherence) that ensure the stability of such microbial consortia during adaptation to ambient conditions. intercellular contacts with the aid of different extracellular structures--microfibrillae, knob-like juts, cell wall evaginations, and capsuleform stuff(glycocalix)--are the result of genetically determined self-regulating development of microbial populations as multicellular  systems.

TI  == selection of species-specific dna probes which detect strain restriction polymorphism in four bifidobacterium species.
AB  == randomly cloned fragments (in a size range 1 to 2.5 kb) of dna from bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, b. adolescentis cip 64.59t, b. bifidum cip 64.65 and b. animalis atcc 25527 were used as hybridization probes to characterize strains of these species and distinguish them from closely related bifidobacterium species. the fragments were screened for hybridization with native dna from 41 different bifidobacterium strains. for each species, a fragment hybridizing specifically with dna from strains of the same species was isolated. each fragment was then hybridized with restriction digests in order to  study the genome polymorphism. in some of the tested b. longum strains including  strain atcc 15707, the species-specific fragment l6/45 hybridized with 2 fragments instead of one as expected. sequence of the fragment revealed the presence of an orf which had an amino acid sequence similar to the site-specific  recombinases of lambda integrase family. moreover, southern analysis demonstrated that at least 3 copies of this fragment are present in the chromosome of b. longum atcc 15707 and in some other b. longum strains. the species-specific fragment a6/17 of b. adolescentis hybridized with the same restriction fragment on the eight strains of this species tested. the b. bifidum-specific fragment hybridized with different dna restriction fragments according to the strain. the  restriction fragment an1 from b. animalis atcc 25527 hybridized with the same restriction fragment from strain b. animalis atcc 27536. however, these two strains could be differentiated by another restriction pattern. thus, hybridization results highlight the genetic polymorphism which exists among bifidobacterium strains of the same species.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  == a 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. the blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. the decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. the dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was bifidobacterium sp., bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium lonqum, lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, peptococcus magnus bifidobacterium longum. in contrast, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides distasonis, b. ovatus, bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. among microorganisms isolated from the patient, morganella morganii, candida sp., eubacterium aerofacience and eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; streptococcus mitior, staphylococcus intermedius, micrococcus kristinae, selenomonas ruminantum, bacteroides ureolyticus and lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. these results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.

TI  == species-specific oligonucleotide probes for five bifidobacterium species detected in human intestinal microflora.
AB  == portions of the 16s rrna from closely related species of the genus bifidobacterium that are found in the human intestinal microflora were sequenced  in order to design species-specific oligonucleotide probes. five oligonucleotide  probes ranging from 16 to 19 bases in length and complementary to 16s rrna sequences from bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were synthesized. with crude high-molecular-weight rna preparations as targets, these probes showed the desired species specificity, even down to a 1-nucleotide difference. for the practical evaluation of these probes, their specificity and sensitivity were tested against seven strains of the same species and 54 strains of heterologous bacteria with fixed whole cells as targets. the probes for b. adolescentis, b. breve, and b. longum showed efficient and specific hybridization. although the probes for b. bifidum and b. infantis cross-reacted with a few bacterial strains not isolated from humans, these probes showed species specificity for human intestinal bacteria. these 16s rrna probes should prove valuable for the identification and detection of human intestinal bifidobacterium species.

TI  == [the biological properties of bifidobacterium].
AB  == the possibility of the formation of exoenzymes, such as dnaase, rnaase and hemolysin, by bifidobacteria was studied in comparison with their acid-forming and adhesive activity. bifidobacterium reference strains, originally isolated from healthy adults and children, were studied. the study involved altogether 73  strains of bifidobacteria, including 24 b. bifidum strains, 13 b. adolescentis strains, 7 b. infantis strains, 10 b. breve strains and 19 b. longum strains. the bifidobacteria under study were shown to differ not only in the presence and activity of properties useful for macroorganisms, but also in the presence of enzymes having depolymerizing activity (dnaase, hemolysin). thus, out of 73 strains under study 9 proved to be dnaase-positive and 6, hemolysin positive. at  the same time a specific feature of bifidobacteria was their high acid-forming activity with the complete absence of rnaase activity and insignificant dnaase- and hemolysin-forming activity.

TI  == [the effect of phospholipids on the adhesive properties of bacteria].
AB  == the present work shows that choline-containing phospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-1-alkyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine) inhibit the adhesion of some strains: bacterium bifidum 1, b. adolescentis mc-42, b. longum b. 379m, staphylococcus aureus p 209 and klebsiella pneumoniae 52. phosphatidylcholine produces no effect on the adhesiveness of these strains, while platelet activation factor stimulates adhesiveness only in strain s. aureus 209. the stimulating or inhibiting action of phospholipids on the adhesive process of microorganisms depends on the species of bacteria and on the concentration of reagents.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.
