TI  == manipulating the gut microbiota to maintain health and treat disease.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota composition varies between healthy and diseased individuals for numerous diseases. although any cause or effect relationship between the alterations in the gut microbiota and disease is not always clear, targeting the intestinal microbiota might offer new possibilities for prevention and/or treatment of disease. objective: here we review some examples of manipulating the intestinal microbiota by prebiotics, probiotics, and fecal microbial transplants. results: prebiotics are best known for their ability to increase the number of bifidobacteria. however, specific prebiotics could potentially also stimulate other species they can also stimulate other species associated with health, like akkermansia muciniphila, ruminococcus bromii, the roseburia/enterococcus rectale group, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii. probiotics have beneficial health effects for different diseases and digestive symptoms. these effects can be due to the direct effect of the probiotic bacterium or its products itself, as well as effects of the probiotic on the resident microbiota. probiotics can influence the microbiota composition as well  as the activity of the resident microbiota. fecal microbial transplants are a drastic intervention in the gut microbiota, aiming for total replacement of one microbiota by another. with numerous successful studies related to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection, the potential of fecal microbial transplants to treat other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and metabolic and cardiovascular disorders is  under investigation. conclusions: improved knowledge on the specific role of gut  microbiota in prevention and treatment of disease will help more targeted manipulation of the intestinal microbiota. further studies are necessary to see the (long term) effects for health of these interventions.

TI  == potential of novel dextran oligosaccharides as prebiotics for obesity management  through in vitro experimentation.
AB  == the energy-salvaging capacity of the gut microbiota from dietary ingredients has  been proposed as a contributing factor for the development of obesity. this knowledge generated interest in the use of non-digestible dietary ingredients such as prebiotics to manipulate host energy homeostasis. in the present study, the in vitro response of obese human faecal microbiota to novel oligosaccharides  was investigated. dextrans of various molecular weights and degrees of branching  were fermented with the faecal microbiota of healthy obese adults in ph-controlled batch cultures. changes in bacterial populations were monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and scfa concentrations were analysed by  hplc. the rate of gas production and total volume of gas produced were also determined. in general, the novel dextrans and inulin increased the counts of bifidobacteria. some of the dextrans were able to alter the composition of the obese human microbiota by increasing the counts of bacteroides-prevotella and decreasing those of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and ruminococcus bromii/r. flavefaciens. considerable increases in scfa concentrations were observed in response to all substrates. gas production rates were similar during the fermentation of all dextrans, but significantly lower than those during the fermentation of inulin. lower total gas production and shorter time to attain maximal gas production were observed during the fermentation of the linear 1 kda  dextran than during the fermentation of the other dextrans. the efficacy of bifidobacteria to ferment dextrans relied on the molecular weight and not on the  degree of branching. in conclusion, there are no differences in the profiles between the obese and lean human faecal fermentations of dextrans.

TI  == dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  == background: a custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  rna probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and crohn's disease (cd) patients. methods: oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "goarray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16s rrna sequences. fecal 16s rdna  from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six cd patients were used as  template to generate fluorescently labeled crna that was hybridized to the microarray. differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific primer sets. results: the microarray analyses showed that eubacterium rectale, bacteroides fragilis group, b. vulgatus, ruminococcus albus, r. callidus, r. bromii, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the cd patients, while enterococcus sp., clostridium difficile, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and listeria sp. were more abundant in the cd group. conclusions: the microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. in addition, the microarray showed that enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the cd patients. this microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == highlighting new phylogenetic specificities of crohn's disease microbiota.
AB  == background: recent studies suggest that gastrointestinal (gi) microbes play a part in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd). methods: fecal samples were collected from 16 healthy individuals and 16 cd patients (age- and sex-matched).  the dna extracted from these samples were subjected to two different methods of microbiome analysis. specific bacterial groups were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods using primers designed using a high-throughput in-house bioinformatics pipeline. the same dna extracts were also used to produce fluorescently labeled crna amplicons to interrogate a custom-designed phylogenetic microarray for intestinal bacteria. results: even though the intersubject variability was high, differences in the fecal microbiomes of healthy and cd patients were detected. faecalibacterium prausnitzii and escherichia coli were more represented in healthy and ileal cd patients, respectively. additionally, probes specific for ruminococcus bromii, oscillibacter valericigenes, bifidobacterium bifidum, and eubacterium rectale produced stronger hybridization signals with the dna samples from healthy subjects. conversely, species overrepresented in cd patients were e. coli, enterococcus faecium, and species from the proteobacteria not normally found in the healthy human gi tract. furthermore, we detected "healthy specific" molecular species or operational taxonomic units (otus) that are not closely related to any known species (faecalibacterium, subdoligranulum, and oscillospora species), indicating that the phylogenetic dysbiosis is broader than at strain or species level. conclusions: these two techniques of microbiome analysis provided a statistically robust new picture of the dysbiosis in fecal microbiota from ileal  cd patients. specifically, we identified a set of six species discriminant for cd, which provides a preliminary diagnostic tool.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.
