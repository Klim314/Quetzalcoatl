TI  == alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  == the aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made  up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (bhi-blood agar), adjusted to ph 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic glove box. bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched bhi broth  adjusted to ph 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and  16s rdna sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. in the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard bhi-blood agars (ph 7.0) were used. of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at ph 9.0 and 4 at ph 10.0. the alkali-resistant strains included enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and streptococcus mitis (2 strains). three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus firmicutes or staphylococcus at the genus level. the present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at ph 9.0 and/or ph 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus enterococcus.
