TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == a simple and rapid method of bacterial transformation.
AB  == recently, a unique method for bacterial transformation using nanofibers to inoculate dna has been developed by naoto yoshida and colleagues. we have verified the principle, transforming escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and acinetobacter baumannii, and have established a user-friendly protocol. a buffered suspension of sepiolite-an inexpensive, fibrous yet inoffensive mineral-is mixed with bacteria and transforming dna and the mixture directly spread on selective agar.
