TI  == feasibility of biohydrogen production from industrial wastes using defined microbial co-culture.
AB  == background: the development of clean or novel alternative energy has become a global trend that will shape the future of energy. in the present study, 3 microbial strains with different oxygen requirements, including clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and kluyveromyces marxianus 15d, were used to construct a hydrogen production system that was composed of a mixed aerobic-facultative anaerobic-anaerobic consortium. the effects of metal ions, organic acids and carbohydrate substrates on this system were analyzed and compared using electrochemical and kinetic assays. it was then  tested using small-scale experiments to evaluate its ability to convert starch in 5 l of organic wastewater into hydrogen. for the one-step biohydrogen production  experiment, h1 medium (nutrient broth and potato dextrose broth) was mixed directly with gam broth to generate h2 medium (h1 medium and gam broth). finally, clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824, enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and kluyveromyces marxianus 15d of three species microbial co-culture to produce hydrogen under anaerobic conditions. for the two-step biohydrogen production experiment, the h1 medium, after cultured the microbial strains enterobacter cloacae atcc 13047 and kluyveromyces marxianus 15d, was centrifuged to remove the microbial cells and then mixed with gam broth (h2 medium). afterward, the bacterial strain clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 was inoculated into the h2 medium to produce hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation. results: the experimental results demonstrated that the optimum conditions for the small-scale fermentative hydrogen production system were at ph 7.0, 35 degrees c, a mixed medium, including h1 medium and h2 medium with 0.50 mol/l ferrous chloride, 0.50 mol/l magnesium sulfate, 0.50 mol/l potassium chloride, 1% w/v citric acid, 5% w/v fructose and 5% w/v glucose. the overall hydrogen production efficiency in the shake flask fermentation group was 33.7 ml/h(-1).l(-1), and those the two-step and the one-step processes of the small-scale fermentative hydrogen production system were 41.2 ml/h(-1).l(-1) and 35.1 ml/h(-1).l(-1), respectively. conclusion: therefore, the results indicate that the hydrogen production efficiency of the two-step process is higher than that of the one-step process.

TI  == continuous hydrogen production from organic waste.
AB  == the antibiotic effects of lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus paracasei, on hydrogen production were investigated using glucose as the substrate for the batch experiments. the effects of lactic acid bacteria on hydrogen fermentation depended on ph and the inhibition of hydrogen-producing bacteria was prevented by keeping the ph over 5.0. then, a continuous hydrogen production experiment was conducted by using bean curd manufacturing waste as an actual organic waste at ph 5.5 at 35 degrees c. the increase of the substrate concentration and the addition of nitrogen gave precedence to acetic and butyric acids production in the metabolic pathway and suppressed propionic acid production. as the result, continuous hydrogen production from municipal organic waste was enabled.

TI  == molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the beta-galactosidase gene from enterobacter cloacae gao.
AB  == the gene encoding a beta-galactosidase from enterobacter cloacae gao was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of the insert of a positive clone had an open reading frame of 3084 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 1028 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 116,677 daltons. the amino acid sequence of beta-galactosidase deduced from the nucleotide sequence, especially the sequence around the putative active site and of the fourteen regions, showed significant homology to beta-galactosidases of other microorganisms, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and clostridium acetobutylicum.
