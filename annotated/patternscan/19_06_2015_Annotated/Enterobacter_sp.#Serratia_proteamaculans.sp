TI  == characterization of rara, a novel arac family multidrug resistance regulator in klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == transcriptional regulators, such as soxs, rama, mara, and rob, which upregulate the acrab efflux pump, have been shown to be associated with multidrug resistance in clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria. in addition to the multidrug resistance phenotype, these regulators have also been shown to play a role in the cellular metabolism and possibly the virulence potential of microbial cells. as such, the increased expression of these proteins is likely to cause pleiotropic phenotypes. klebsiella pneumoniae is a major nosocomial pathogen which can express the soxs, mara, rob, and rama proteins, and the accompanying paper shows  that the increased transcription of rama is associated with tigecycline resistance (m. veleba and t. schneiders, antimicrob. agents chemother. 56:4466-4467, 2012). bioinformatic analyses of the available klebsiella genome sequences show that an additional arac-type regulator is encoded chromosomally. in this work, we characterize this novel arac-type regulator, hereby called rara  (regulator of antibiotic resistance a), which is encoded in k. pneumoniae, enterobacter sp. 638, serratia proteamaculans 568, and enterobacter cloacae. we show that the overexpression of rara results in a multidrug resistance phenotype  which requires a functional acrab efflux pump but is independent of the other arac regulators. quantitative real-time pcr experiments show that rara (mgh 78578 kpn_02968) and its neighboring efflux pump operon oqxab (kpn_02969_02970) are consistently upregulated in clinical isolates collected from various geographical locations (chile, turkey, and germany). our results suggest that rara overexpression upregulates the oqxab efflux pump. additionally, it appears that oqxr, encoding a gntr-type regulator adjacent to the oqxab operon, is able to downregulate the expression of the oqxab efflux pump, where oqxr complementation  resulted in reductions to olaquindox mics.

TI  == genome survey and characterization of endophytic bacteria exhibiting a beneficial effect on growth and development of poplar trees.
AB  == the association of endophytic bacteria with their plant hosts has a beneficial effect for many different plant species. our goal is to identify endophytic bacteria that improve the biomass production and the carbon sequestration potential of poplar trees (populus spp.) when grown in marginal soil and to gain  an insight in the mechanisms underlying plant growth promotion. members of the gammaproteobacteria dominated a collection of 78 bacterial endophytes isolated from poplar and willow trees. as representatives for the dominant genera of endophytic gammaproteobacteria, we selected enterobacter sp. strain 638, stenotrophomonas maltophilia r551-3, pseudomonas putida w619, and serratia proteamaculans 568 for genome sequencing and analysis of their plant growth-promoting effects, including root development. derivatives of these endophytes, labeled with gfp, were also used to study the colonization of their poplar hosts. in greenhouse studies, poplar cuttings (populus deltoides x populus nigra dn-34) inoculated with enterobacter sp. strain 638 repeatedly showed the highest increase in biomass production compared to cuttings of noninoculated control plants. sequence data combined with the analysis of their metabolic properties resulted in the identification of many putative mechanisms, including  carbon source utilization, that help these endophytes to thrive within a plant environment and to potentially affect the growth and development of their plant hosts. understanding the interactions between endophytic bacteria and their host  plants should ultimately result in the design of strategies for improved poplar biomass production on marginal soils as a feedstock for biofuels.

TI  == characterization of the zinc-containing metalloprotease encoded by zpx and development of a species-specific detection method for enterobacter sakazakii.
AB  == enterobacter sakazakii causes a severe form of neonatal meningitis that occurs as sporadic cases as well as outbreaks. the disease has been epidemiologically associated with consumption of reconstituted, dried infant formulas. very little  information is available regarding pathogenicity of the organism and production of virulence factors. clinical and environmental strains were screened for production of factors which have activity against chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells in tissue culture. polymyxin b lysate and sonicate preparations but not culture supernatants from the strains caused "rounding" of cho cells. subsequent  studies showed that the cho cell-rounding factor is a proteolytic enzyme that has activity against azocasein. the cell-bound protease was isolated by using a combination of polymyxin b lysis, followed by sonication of cells harvested from  tryptone broth. the protease was purified to homogeneity by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration chromatography with sephadex g-100, hydrophobic interaction chromatography with phenyl-sepharose cl-4b, and a second  gel filtration with sephadex g-100. in addition to activity against azocasein, the purified protease also exhibits activity against azocoll and insoluble casein but not elastin. the protease has a molecular weight of 38,000 and an isoelectric point of 4.4. it is heat labile and for maximal activity against azocasein has an optimum temperature of 37 degrees c and a ph range of 5 to 7. proteolytic activity is inhibited by ortho-phenanthroline and zincov but is not affected by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, n-ethylmaleimide, and trypsin inhibitors, which demonstrates that the protease is a zinc-containing metalloprotease. the metalloprotease does not hemagglutinate chicken or sheep erythrocytes. twenty-three to 27 of the first 42 n-terminal amino acid residues of the metalloprotease are identical to proteases produced by serratia proteamaculans, pectobacterium carotovorum, and anabaena sp. pcr analysis using primers designed  from a consensus nucleotide sequence showed that 135 e. sakazakii strains possessed the metalloprotease gene, zpx, and 25 non-e. sakazakii strains did not. the cloned zpx gene of strain 29544 consists of 1,026 nucleotides, and the deduced amino acid sequence of the metalloprotease has 341 amino acid residues, which corresponds to a theoretical protein size of 37,782 with a theoretical pi of 5.23. the sequence possesses three well-characterized zinc-binding and active-site motifs present in other bacterial zinc metalloproteases.

TI  == hemolysin as a marker for serratia.
AB  == all serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. dna fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal dna of s. marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. kiliensis, s. grimesii, s. proteamaculans, s. plymutica, s. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. the restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. s. ficaria and s. marinorubra expressed  a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the s. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. the dna of the latter strains did not hybridize with the s. marcescens hemolysin dna probes. some s. marcescens strains, s. kiliensis and s. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. no hybridization was found with dna of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella arerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosus, listeria sp.,  aeromonas sp., legionella sp. and a meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin dna probes are specific for serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than serratia.
