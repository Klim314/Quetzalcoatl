survival of freeze-dried leuconostoc mesenteroides and lactobacillus plantarum related to their cellular fatty acids composition during storage.
lactic acid bacteria strains lactobacillus plantarum cwbi-b534 and leuconostoc ssp. mesenteroides (l. mesenteroides) kenya mrog2 were produced in bioreactor, concentrated, with or without cryoprotectants. in general, viable population did not change significantly after freeze-drying (p > 0.05). in most cases, viable population for cells added with cryoprotectants was significantly lower than those without (p < 0.05). cellular fatty acids (cfas) from the two strains in this study were analyzed before and after freeze-drying. six cfas were identified, namely, palmitic (c(16:0)), palmitoleic (c(16:1)), stearic (c(18:0)), oleic (c(18:1)), linoleic (c(18:2)), and linolenic (c(18:3)) acids were identified. four of them, c(16:0), c(16:1), c(18:0), and c(18:1), make up more than 94% or 93% of the fatty acids in l. mesenteroides and l. plantarum, respectively, with another one, namely, c18:3, making a smaller (on average 5-6%, respectively) contribution. the c(18:2) contributed very small percentages (on average <or= 1%) to the total in each strain. c(16:0) had the highest proportion at most points relative to other fatty acids. moisture content and water activity (a (w)) increased significantly during the storage period. it was observed that c(16:1)/c(16:0), c(18:0)/c(16:0) and c(18:1)/c(16:0) ratios for freeze-dried l. mesenteroides or l. plantarum, with or without cryoprotectants, did not change significantly during the storage period. according to the packaging mode and storage temperatures, c(18:2)/c(16:0) and c(18:3)/c(16:0) ratios for freeze-dried l. mesenteroides and l. plantarum with or without cryoprotectants decreased as the storage time increased. however, a higher c(18:2)/c(16:0) or c(18:3)/c(16:0) ratio for l. mesenteroides and l. plantarum was noted in the freeze-dried powder held at 4 degrees c or under vacuum and in dark than at 20 degrees c or in the presence of oxygen and light.
identification of the agent from lactobacillus plantarum kfri464 that enhances bacteriocin production by leuconostoc citreum gj7.
aim: to provide evidence that the production of bacteriocin by lactic acid bacteria can be enhanced by the presence of a bacteriocin-sensitive strain and identify the agent that is responsible for enhancing bacteriocin production. methods and results: one bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacterium was isolated from kimchi. the strain gj7 was designated as leuconostoc citreum gj7 based on gram staining, biochemical properties, and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the isolate produced a heat- and ph-stable bacteriocin (kimchicin gj7), which has antagonistic activity against a broad spectrum of micro-organisms. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified kimchicin gj7 showed a single band of molecular weight c. 3500 da. cultures of leuc. citreum gj7 in the presence of thermally inactivated kimchicin gj7-sensitive strains, lactobacillus plantarum kfri 464, lactobacillus delbrueckii kfri 347, or leuconostoc mesenteroides kctc 1628, increased bacteriocin production. this inducing factor was characterized and purified from lact. plantarum kfri 464, which showed the greatest enhancement of kimchicin gj7 activity. the inducing factor was purified using a deae (diethyl aminoethyl)-sephacel column and high-performance liquid chromatography, and yielded a single band of c. 6500 da. n-terminal sequencing of the inducing factor identified 16 amino acids. the n-terminal sequence of the inducing factor was synthesized and examined for the induction of kimchicin gj7 activity, and was found to induce activity, but at a level about 10% lower than that of the entire molecule. conclusions: the presence of a bacteriocin-sensitive strain, lact. plantarum kfri 464, acts as an environmental stimulus to activate the production of kimchicin gj7 by leuc. citreum gj7. the inducing factor from lact. plantarum kfri 464 is highly homologous to the 30s ribosomal protein s16 from various micro-organisms. the n-terminal sequence of the inducing factor examined in this study is a very important sequence related to the inducing activity. nevertheless, the inducing factor may not be part of the ribosomal protein s16 itself. significance and impact of the study: we believe that the present study is the first to identify an agent that is produced by one micro-organism and influences bacteriocin production in another. the bacteriocin-enhancing system described in this study could be effectively used to control the growth of other micro-organisms (sensitive cells) in food systems. moreover, this enhancement of bacteriocin production can be applied usefully in industrial production of natural food preservatives.
lactic acid bacteria associated with vacuum-packed cooked meat product spoilage:  population analysis by rdna-based methods.
aim: to determine the lactic acid bacteria (lab) implicated in bloating spoilage  of vacuum-packed and refrigerated meat products. methods and results: a total of 18 samples corresponding to four types of meat products, with and without spoilage symptoms, were studied. in all, 387 colonies growing on de man, rogosa and sharpe, yeast glucose lactose peptone and trypticase soy yeast extract plates were identified by internal spacer region (isr), isr-restriction fragment length polymorphism and rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis profiles as lactobacillus (37%), leuconostoc (43%), carnobacterium (11%), enterococcus (4%) and lactococcus (2%). leuconostoc mesenteroides dominated the microbial population of spoiled products and was always present at the moment bloating occurred. lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus curvatus were found in decreasing order of abundance. the analysis of two meat products, 'morcilla' and 'fiambre de magro adobado' obtained from production lines revealed a common succession pattern in lab populations in both products and showed that leuc. mesenteroides became the main species during storage, despite being below the detection level of culture methods after packing. conclusions: our results pointed to leuc. mesenteroides as the main species responsible for bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed meat products. significance and impact of the study: prevention of bloating spoilage in vacuum-packed cooked meat products requires the sensitive detection of leuc. mesenteroides (i.e. by pcr).
evaluation of meat born lactic acid bacteria as protective cultures for the biopreservation of cooked meat products.
in this study, 91 strains, originating from meat products, were subjected to a step-by-step screening and characterisation to search for potential protective cultures to be used in the cooked cured meat industry. strains were first tested on their homofermentative and psychrotrophic character and salt tolerance. secondly, the antibacterial capacities towards listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc carnosum and brochotrix thermosphacta were determined in an agar spot test. in total, 38% of the tested strains were inhibitory towards all indicator strains. however, 91%, 88% and 74% of the strains could inhibit, respectively, l. monocytogenes, b. thermosphacta and leuc. mesenteroides. finally, 12 strains, with the highest antibacterial capacities, were evaluated on their competitive nature by comparing their growth rate, acidifying character and lactic acid production at 7 degrees c under anaerobic conditions in a liquid broth. all 12 strains, except for a bacteriocin producing lactobacillus plantarum strain and the lactocin s producing lactobacillus sakei 148, combined a fast growth rate with a deep and rapid acidification caused by the production of high levels of lactic acid. the 12 selected strains were then further investigated for their growth capacity on a model cooked ham product to establish whether the presence of these cultures on the ham did not negatively influence the sensory properties of the ham. all strains grew in 6 days at 7 degrees c from a level of 10(5)-10(6) to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g and again the bacteriocin producing l. plantarum strain was the slowest growing strain. as the glucose level of the model cooked ham product was low (0.09+/-0.03%), growth of the putative protective cultures resulted in glucose depletion and a limited lactic acid production and accompanying ph decrease. cooked ham inoculated with isolates 13e, 10a, 14a (all three identified as l. sakei subsp. carnosus by sds-page) and with strains l. sakei 148 (ls5) and l. sakei subsp. carnosus saga 777 (ls8) were not rejected by the sensory panel at the 34th day of the vacuum packaged storage at 7 degrees c. therefore, these strains could have potential for the use as protective culture in cooked meat products.
characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.
effect of elevated oxygen and carbon dioxide on the surface growth of vegetable-associated micro-organisms.
the impact of a novel type of modified atmosphere (ma), referred to as high o2-ma, on micro-organisms associated with the spoilage of minimally-processed vegetables was studied. pure cultures of pseudomonas fluorescens, enterobacter agglomerans, aureobacterium strain 27, candida guilliermondii, c. sake, salmonella typhimurium, salm. enteritidis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, leuconostoc mesenteroides var. mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum and lactococcus lactis were cultured on an agar-surface model system and incubated at 8 degrees c under an atmosphere composed of o2 (80 or 90%, balanced with n2), co2 (10 or 20%, balanced with n2), or a combination of both gases. in general, exposure to high o2 alone did not inhibit microbial growth strongly, while co2 alone reduced growth to some extent in most cases. consistently strong inhibition was observed only when the two gases were used in combination. with minimally-processed vegetables, where co2 levels of around 20% or above cannot be used because of physiological damage to the produce, the combined treatment of high o2 and 10-20% co2 may provide adequate suppression of microbial growth, allowing a safe, prolonged shelf-life.
microbiology of controlled rotting of egusi (colocynthis citrullus l.) fruits for the harvesting of the seeds.
microorganisms isolated from naturally rotting egusi fruits which are used as a source of dietary seeds, were mainly bacteria: bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, b. polymyxa, b. megaterium, b. pumilus, lactobacillus plantarum, la. brevis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, klebsiella aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, micrococcus and candida spp. the rotting period of egusi fruits could be decreased from 120 to 72 h by using a mixture of b. subtilis and b. licheniformis.
fermentation of brined turnip roots using lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides starter cultures.
the controlled fermentation of turnip slices using lactobacillus plantarum or leuconostoc mesenteroides as starter cultures led to earlier acid production and earlier and more pronounced inhibition of enterobacteriaceae than with uninoculated (natural) fermentation. unlike the natural fermentation, the controlled fermentations did not show a yeast secondary fermentation and also had a better colour. due to its ability to produce higher amounts of acid, the use of lact. plantarum is more desirable than of leuc. mesenteroides.
plasmid-associated bacteriocin production and sucrose fermentation in pediococcus acidilactici.
production of bacteriocin activity designated pediocin pa-1 was associated with the presence of a 6.2-megadalton plasmid in pediococcus acidilactici pac1.0. the bacteriocin exhibited activity against p. acidilactici, p. pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. casei, l. bifermentans, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum. partial characterization of pediocin pa-1 is described. the molecular weight of pediocin pa-1 was ca. 16,500. additionally, strain pac1.0 was found to contain a 23-megadalton plasmid associated with sucrose-fermenting ability.
