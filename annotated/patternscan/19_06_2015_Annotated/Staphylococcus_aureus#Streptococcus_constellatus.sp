TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == constant high adrenal fdg uptake in pet/ct associated with mitochondrial disease.
AB  == we describe a patient with the m.3243a>g mitochondrial dna mutation who developed sepsis caused by streptococcus constellatus. in the acute phase of illness, abnormally high uptake of (18)f-fdg was observed in both adrenal glands that appeared anatomically normal. in repeated imaging six months later the adrenal uptake had diminished but remained clearly elevated. we did not observe high adrenal fdg uptake as in the patient described here among 30 patients with staphylococcus aureus sepsis that were investigated with identical imaging protocol. in sepsis, oxygen consumption and metabolic rate are increased compared to normal metabolism. the observed high adrenal fdg uptake during sepsis in this  patient probably reflects the acute metabolic stress induced by the infection. interestingly, in repeated imaging six months later, the adrenal suvs had diminished but were still abnormally high: this suggests constant high levels of  metabolic stress associated with the mitochondrial disorder.

TI  == periocular necrotizing fasciitis causing blindness.
AB  == importance: periocular necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but potentially devastating disease, accompanied by high rates of morbidity and mortality. observations: we report 5 cases of periocular necrotizing fasciitis resulting in  severe vision loss, 3 of which required exenteration to contain the disease and only 1 of which recovered vision. three cases were caused by group a streptococcus; 1, by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; and 1, by streptococcus anginosus constellatus. conclusions and relevance: providers should maintain a high clinical suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis and distinguish it from more common forms of cellulitis. as seen in these 5 cases, periocular necrotizing fasciitis may cause severe visual loss more often than previously recognized. to our knowledge, this is also the first report of streptococcus anginosus constellatus causing necrotizing fasciitis.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents --special references to bacteria isolated between april 2008 and march 2009].
AB  == bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from april 2008 to march 2009 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 712 strains including 18 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 173 (80.5%) of 215 patients with surgical infections. three hundred and sixty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 346 strains were isolated from postoperative infections.  from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate  of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections.  among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, p aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, streptococcus constellatus and gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis was  the highest from primary infections, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and bilophila wadsworthia, and from postoperative infections,  b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by b. thetaiotaomicron, b.  wadsworthia and b. ovatus, in this order. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and enterococcus spp., nor  multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == surgical site infections in day surgery settings.
AB  == background: because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. we performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. methods: all procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. there were  155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. all patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. results: one patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by staphylococcus schleiferi. the patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. one patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep  incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees c) caused by staphylococcus aureus. he was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. one patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. a group a streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. in the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus constellatus. no antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. conclusion: in our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.

TI  == hypertrophic osteoarthropathy secondary to vascular prosthesis infection: report  of 3 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == an infected vascular graft is an uncommon association in hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (hoa) but is important because of potential catastrophic complications. here we describe 3 new patients with hoa secondary to vascular prosthesis infection and review the other 23 patients described in the english literature with this clinical syndrome. the finding of symptoms and signs of localized hoa in patients with arterial prosthesis may be the presenting manifestation of graft sepsis. in most patients the graft is located at the aorta or aortic bifurcation. the initial symptoms are fever, joint pain mainly involving the knees and ankles, clubbing, and in some cases intestinal bleeding.  recurrent abscesses and bacteremia arising in spite of appropriate antimicrobial  therapy are prominent infectious signs. another characteristic feature is the wide variety of bacteria isolated from a single patient. when a polymicrobial enteric flora is isolated from the blood or other tissue, an intestinal origin of infection can be readily suspected. gallium or leukocyte scans are useful for detecting an abscess around the vascular prosthesis. in some cases, the detection of gas around the graft demonstrated by computed tomography is highly suggestive  of prosthesis infection. mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hoa associated with aortic graft infection are unknown. treatment consists of intravenous antibiotics and surgical replacement of the infected graft. the prognosis of arterial prosthesis infection depends greatly on early diagnosis and treatment before the onset of life-threatening complications. knowledge of this rare association may lead to an early diagnosis and appropriate management of this serious and often fatal complication.

TI  == effect of saliva on an antimicrobial tissue conditioner containing silver-zeolite.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of human saliva on the antimicrobial effect of a tissue conditioner containing an antibiotic agent, silver-zeolite. samples of each tissue conditioner with or without silver-zeolite were prepared and a plastic disk was used as a control. candida albicans and nosocomial respiratory infection-causing bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa and the streptococcus milleri group (s. constellatus and s. intermedius), were selected as test microorganisms. antimicrobial effects of samples after water or saliva immersion for 28 days were evaluated by counting the number of viable cells [colony forming unit (cfu)] in each microbial suspension (100 microl). all data were statistically analysed by one-way anova and bonferroni's test (p < 0.05). the antimicrobial effects of samples with silver-zeolite immersed in saliva against c. albicans, s. aureus and mrsa were observed while cfu of p. aeruginosa  indicated no significant difference from that of the control. as for the s. milleri group, its cfu after saliva immersion showed the significantly smaller value than that of the control. it is concluded that the antimicrobial effects of samples containing silver-zeolite against all tested microbes except for p. aeruginosa and the s. milleri group are not influenced by saliva immersion for 28 days.

TI  == [a case of spinal epidural abscess associated with retropharyngeal abscess].
AB  == spinal epidural abscesses are known to occur associated with retropharyngeal abscess, but such cases are few in the literature. we treated a 72-year-old woman who reported pain in the back of the neck. computed tomography (ct) showed a retropharyngeal abscess extending to the upper neck through the carotid space on  the left side and an magnetic resonance imaging (mri) showed a spinal epidural abscess without cervical vertebral osteomyelitis. the abscess was assumed to reach the epidural space along the nerve root through the intervertebral foramen. since tonsillitis appeared to cause the retropharyngeal abscess, we performed tonsillectomy, and then drained pus through the superior constrictor muscle, effecting a subsequent cure. staphylococcus aureus was recovered from both the pus and tonsil, and streptococcus constellatus, a member of the streptococcus milleri group, from the tonsil. based on a review of the literature, clinical courses of spinal epidural abscess associated with retropharyngeal abscess are not always simple, as 4 of the 7 cases found demonstrated poor prognosis. spinal  epidural abscess should be considered a critical complication of retropharyngeal  abscess.

TI  == interaction between human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and streptococcus milleri  group bacteria.
AB  == because streptococcus milleri group (smg) bacteria--streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus anginosus--exhibit a striking propensity to cause abscesses, the interaction of these organisms with human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) was examined. after incubation in pooled normal human serum, smg stimulated less chemotaxis than did staphylococcus aureus, in contrast to viridans streptococci, which caused greater chemotaxis than did s. aureus. pmnl ingested greater numbers of smg and viridans streptococci than s. aureus but killed these organisms more slowly and less completely. relative resistance to killing by pmnl is expected in organisms that  cause abscesses, and inhibition of chemotaxis may contribute to pathogenicity, because delayed arrival of pmnl gives a head start to proliferating bacteria. this study helps explain the capacity of smg to cause abscesses. it is unclear, however, why viridans streptococci, bacteria that rarely produce abscesses, share some of these same properties.

TI  == [clinical significance of the streptococcus milleri group in peritonsillar abscesses].
AB  == few researchers have microbiologically studied peritonsillar abscesses in detail, and their results have been conflicting. although streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-streptococcus) is commonly considered an important pathogen in this infection, recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of many other streptococci mainly consisting of alpha-streptococci. few studies have identified these streptococci at the species level, however. we studied details of bacteriology in 31 cases of peritonsillar abscess treated between 1991 and 2000.  the streptococcus milleri group was most frequently isolated (25.8%), followed by eikenella corrodens (9.7%), staphylococcus aureus (6.5%), and s. pyogenes (3.2%). the s. milleri group, consisting of 3 species of streptococcus constellatus, s. intermedius, and s. anginosus, forms part of the normal flora most commonly found in the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. these species have become known as an important pathogen in abscess disease but little attention has been paid to their role in peritonsillar abscesses. to adequately culture the s. milleri group, incubation in air containing carbon dioxide or in an anaerobic condition is required, and then the differentiation of the 3 species requires the biochemical reactivity tests. since hemolytic patterns of the s. milleri group vary, we studied the population of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hemolytic strains among 36 strains of this group. we found 32 (88.8%) to be alpha-hemolytic. although not all alpha-hemolytic strains belong to the s. milleri group, a considerable number of this group could be missed among alpha-streptococci isolated from the peritonsillar abscess. as antibiotics began  being used widely, normal flora such as the s. milleri group may have become an important pathogen in peritonsillar abscesses due to an imbalance between organisms and host defense.

TI  == meningitis caused by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae: a retrospective clinical study.
AB  == we reviewed the medical records of 26 patients (median age 62 years, range 5-76 years) admitted to our institution during 1978-98 with acute bacterial meningitis (abm) caused by streptococci other than streptococcus pneumoniae (comprising 1.9% of all patients with abm). 19 cases were community-acquired and 7 were nosocomial. 73% had comorbid or predisposing conditions and 73% had an identifiable extracerebral focus; only in 2 patients no comorbid disease, primary focus or predisposing condition was present. five patients had cerebral abscesses, and 5 had endocarditis. beta-haemolytic streptococci were grown in 14  cases (serotype a: 4, b: 5, c: 1, g: 4) and were predominant among patients with  endocarditis, whereas alpha- or non-haemolytic strains grew in 12 cases (s. mitis: 4, s. constellatus: 2, e. faecalis: 2, s. bovis: 1, unspecified: 3) and were predominant in patients with a brain abscess. staphylococcus aureus grew together with a streptococcus in 2 cases. blood culture was positive in 9 cases (35%). neurologic complications occurred in 11 patients (42%) and extraneurologic complications in 18 patients (69%). adverse outcomes occurred in 10 patients (38%), including 3 patients who died. occurrence of seizures at any time of disease was significantly associated with an adverse outcome; no other clinical or paraclinical features appeared to affect outcome.

TI  == abscess forming ability of streptococcus milleri group: synergistic effect with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the abscess forming abilities of "streptococcus milleri" strains (streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginiosus, and streptococcus intermedius) isolated from dentoalveolar abscesses and the synergistic effect of fusobacterium nucleatum co-inoculated with the isolates were examined on a mouse subcutaneous abscess model. five days after inoculation, all s. milleri strains formed abscesses, which showed less pathological spread to surrounding connective tissues than those formed by staphylococcus aureus 209p strain and were similar to those by f. nucleatum atcc25586. when each s. milleri strain and f. nucleatum  were co-inoculated, abscess sizes and each bacterial number recovered from abscesses increased in comparison to those treated by bacterial mono-inoculation  of each s. milleri strain or f. nucleatum alone. the strongest synergistic effect was observed in the combination of s. constellatus and f. nucleatum. in a time course experiment with this combination, the recovery of s. constellatus subsequently decreased after the decrement of f. nucleatum, and it appeared that  the association with f. nucleatum maintained the bacterial number of s. constellatus in the abscess. the cell-free supernatant of f. nucleatum had a tendency to increase the abscess size caused by s. constellatus in this model. when s. constellatus was cultured with f. nucleatum culture supernatant in vitro, growth enhancement in the early phase was observed. furthermore, the phagocytic killing of s. constellatus by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) was significantly suppressed and the pmn membranes appeared to be injured by addition of the f. nucleatum culture supernatant. these results suggest that the pathogenicity of s. milleri strains in odontogenic infections may be enhanced by  the co-existence of f. nucleatum.

TI  == pathogenicity of the streptococcus milleri group in pulmonary infections--effect  on phagocytic killing by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == the pathogenicity of streptococcus constellatus in pulmonary infections was investigated in mice in correlation with the phagocytic killing of the microorganisms by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns). the histological inflammation score of the lungs in mice inoculated intratracheally with 10(8) cfu/mouse of the virulent strain s. constellatus rzyk001 obtained from bronchoalveolar fluid of a patient with pneumonia, was significantly higher than  in mice inoculated with the avirulent strains s. constellatus rt4303 and rt6002 obtained from saliva of healthy adults (p < 0.001). the bactericidal activity of  human pmns against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 was not inhibited at all by the culture filtrate of the virulent strain, but the killing index against rzyk001 was 36.4% after 90-min incubation whereas that against rt4303 and rt6002  was 94.7% and 99.4%, respectively (p < 0.001). therefore, these results suggest a possible pathogenic mechanism of s. constellatus apparently mediated by a structural component of the organisms so that a virulent strain is less likely to be killed than an avirulent one, predisposing it to survive in the infection sites.

TI  == pathogenicity of anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 20 strains of facultative or anaerobic gram-positive cocci (agpc) was investigated by injecting them alone or mixed with other flora into mice, utilizing the subcutaneous abscess model. abscesses induced by a mixture of two organisms were uniformly larger than those induced by single organisms. the relationships among seven agpc strains, eight aerobes, and two bacteroides spp. were determined by treating the infected animals with antibiotics and observing the effect of therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. a total of 70 different combinations were tested. as judged by their responses to antimicrobial therapy, facultative cocci or agpc were relatively more important than the other species in 6 combinations, equally important in 35  combinations, and less important in 29 combinations. the agpc most often found to be equal to or more important than the other bacteria were peptococcus magnus, streptococcus constellatus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus were frequently found to be of more importance than the agpc.
