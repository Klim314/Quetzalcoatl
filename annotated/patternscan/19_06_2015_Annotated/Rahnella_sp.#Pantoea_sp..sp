TI  == aerobic microbial community of insectary population of phlebotomus papatasi.
AB  == background: microbes particularly bacteria presenting in the gut of haematophagous insects may have an important role in the epidemiology of human infectious disease. methods: the microbial flora of gut and surrounding environmental of a laboratory strain of phlebotomus papatasi, the main vector of  zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) in the old world, was investigated. biochemical reactions and 16s rdna sequencing of the isolated bacteria against 24 sugars and amino acids were used for bacteria species identification. common mycological media used for fungi identification as well. results: most isolates belonged to the enterobacteriaceae, a large, heterogeneous group of gram-negative rods whose natural habitat is the intestinal tract of humans and animals. enterobacteriaceae groups included edwardsiella, enterobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leminorella, pantoea, proteus, providencia, rahnella, serratia, shigella, tatumella, and yersinia and non enterobacteriaceae groups included bacillus, staphylococcus and pseudomonas. the most prevalent isolates were proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris. these saprophytic and swarming motile bacteria were isolated from all immature, pupae, and mature fed or unfed male or  female sand flies as well as from larval and adult food sources. five fungi species were also isolated from sand flies, their food sources and colonization materials where candida sp. was common in all mentioned sources. conclusion: midgut microbiota are increasingly seen as an important factor for modulating vector competence in insect vectors so their possible effects of the mirobiota on the biology of p. papatasi and their roles in the sandfly-leishmania interaction  are discussed.

TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == phosphate solubilization potential and modeling of stress tolerance of rhizobacteria from rice paddy soil in northern iran.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the phosphate solubilization activity of bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of rice paddy soil in northern iran, and to study the effect of temperature, nacl and ph on the growth of these isolates by modeling. three of the most effective strains from a total of 300 isolates were identified and a phylogenetic analysis was carried out by 16s rdna  sequencing. the isolates were identified as pantoea ananatis (m36), rahnella aquatilis (m100) and enterobacter sp. (m183). these isolates showed multiple plant growth-promoting attributes such as phosphate solubilization activity and indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) production. the m36, m100 and m183 isolates were able  to solubilize 172, 263 and 254 microg ml(-1) of ca3(po4)2 after 5 days of growth  at 28 degrees c and ph 7.5, and to produce 8.0, 2.0 and 3.0 mug ml(-1) of iaa when supplemented with l-tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) for 72 h, at 28 degrees c and ph 7.0, respectively. the solubilization of insoluble phosphate was associated with a drop in the ph of the culture medium and there was an inverse relationship between ph and solubilized p (r = -0.98, p < 0.0952). there were no significant differences among isolates in terms of acidity tolerance based on their confidence limits as assessed by segmented model analysis and all isolates were able to grow at ph 4.3-11 (with optimum at 7.0-7.5). based on a sigmoidal trend of a three-parameter logistic model, the salt concentration required for 50 % inhibition was 8.15, 6.30 and 8.23 % nacl for m36, m100 and m183 isolates, respectively. moreover, the minimum and maximum growth temperatures estimated by  the segmented model were 5.0 and 42.75 degrees c for m36, 12.76 and 40.32 degrees c for m100, and 10.63 and 43.66 degrees c for m183. the three selected isolates could be deployed as inoculants to promote plant growth in an agricultural environment.

TI  == diversity of sporadic symbionts and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria isolated from nodules of woody, shrub, and food legumes in ethiopia.
AB  == fifty-five bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized nodules of woody and shrub legumes growing in ethiopia: crotalaria spp., indigofera spp., and erythrina brucei, and the food legumes soybean and common bean. based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, the majority of the isolates were identified as gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera achromobacter, agrobacterium, burkholderia, cronobacter, enterobacter, mesorhizobium, novosphingobium, pantoea, pseudomonas, rahnella, rhizobium, serratia, and variovorax. seven isolates were gram-positive bacteria belonging to the genera bacillus, paenibacillus, planomicrobium, and rhodococcus. amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) fingerprinting showed that each strain was genetically distinct. according to phylogenetic analysis of reca, glnii, rpob, and 16s rrna gene sequences, rhizobium, mesorhizobium, and agrobacterium were further classified into six different genospecies: agrobacterium spp., agrobacterium radiobacter, rhizobium sp., rhizobium phaseoli, mesorhizobium sp., and putative new rhizobium species. the strains from r. phaseoli, rhizobium sp. iar30, and mesorhizobium sp. err6 induced nodules on their host plants. the other strains did not form nodules on their original host. nine endophytic bacterial strains representing seven genera, agrobacterium, burkholderia, paenibacillus, pantoea, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and serratia, were found to colonize nodules of crotalaria incana and common bean on co-inoculation with symbiotic rhizobia. four endophytic rhizobium and two agrobacterium strains had identical nifh gene sequences with symbiotic rhizobium strains, suggesting horizontal gene transfer.  most symbiotic and nonsymbiotic endophytic bacteria showed plant growth-promoting properties in vitro, which indicate their potential role in the promotion of plant growth when colonizing plant roots and the rhizosphere.

TI  == culturable bacterial microbiota of plagiodera versicolora (l.) (coleoptera: chrysomelidae) and virulence of the isolated strains.
AB  == plagiodera versicolora (laicharting, 1781) (coleoptera: chrysomelidae) is an important forest pest which damages many trees such as willow, poplar, and hazelnut. in order to find new microbes that can be utilized as a possible microbial control agent against this pest, we investigated the culturable bacterial flora of it and tested the isolated bacteria against p. versicolora larvae and adults. we were able to isolate nine bacteria from larvae and adults.  the isolates were characterized using a combination of morphological, biochemical, and physiological methods. additionally, we sequenced the partial sequence of the 16s rrna gene to verify conventional identification results. based on characterization studies, the isolates were identified as staphylococcus sp. pv1, rahnella sp. pv2, rahnella sp. pv3, rahnella sp. pv4, rahnella sp. pv5,  pantoea agglomerans pv6, staphylococcus sp. pv7, micrococcus luteus pv8, and rahnella sp. pv9. the highest insecticidal activity against larvae and adults was obtained from m. luteus pv8 with 50 and 40 % mortalities within 10 days after treatment, respectively. extracellular enzyme activity of the bacterial isolates  such as amylase, proteinase, lipase, cellulose, and chitinase was also determined. consequently, our results show that m. luteus pv8 might be a good candidate as a possible microbial control agent against p. versicolora and were discussed with respect to biocontrol potential of the bacterial isolates.

TI  == identification of the midgut microbiota of an. stephensi and an. maculipennis for their application as a paratransgenic tool against malaria.
AB  == the midgut microbiota associated with anopheles stephensi and anopheles maculipennis (diptera: culicidae) was investigated for development of a paratransgenesis-based approach to control malaria transmission in eastern mediterranean region (emr). here, we present the results of a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and biochemical-based approaches to identify the female adult and  larvae mosquitoe microbiota of these two major malaria vectors, originated from south eastern and north of iran. plating the mosquito midgut contents from lab-reared and field-collected anopheles spp. was used for microbiota isolation.  the gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial colonies were identified by gram staining and specific mediums. selected colonies were identified by differential  biochemical tests and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a number of 10 an. stephensi and 32 an. maculipennis adult mosquitoes and 15 an. stephensi and 7 an. maculipennis larvae were analyzed and 13 sequences of 16s rrna gene bacterial species were retrieved, that were categorized in 3 classes and 8 families. the majority of the identified bacteria were belonged to the gamma-proteobacteria class, including pseudomonas sp. and aeromonas sp. and the others were some closely related to those found in other vector mosquitoes, including pantoea, acinetobacter, brevundimonas, bacillus, sphingomonas, lysinibacillus and rahnella. the 16s rrna sequences in the current study aligned with the reference  strains available in genbank were used for construction of the phylogenetic tree  that revealed the relatedness among the bacteria identified. the presented data strongly encourage further investigations, to verify the potential role of the detected bacteria for the malaria control in iran and neighboring countries.

TI  == comparison of specificity and sensitivity of immunochemical and molecular techniques for determination of clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis.
AB  == detection of clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (cmm), causing bacterial canker of tomato, was verified using pta-elisa and ifas with pabs of neogen europe ltd. (uk), and with published and also laboratory-generated pcr primers from the cmm tomatinase gene. the specificity of this technique was determined with 15 plant-pathogenic and 4 common, saprophytic bacteria. with ifas, crossreactions were found for pantoea dispersa, p. agglomerans and rahnella aquatilis, and with pta-elisa for curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, pectobacterium atrosepticum and dickeya sp. cross-reactions with subspecies other than michiganensis were also found using both methods. molecular methods were optimized by verification of annealing temperatures and times for both primers. conditions were finally adjusted to 30 s at 65 degrees c for dreier's and 10 s at 69 degrees c for our primer set. after this optimization, both primer pairs produced positive reaction only with cmm. by means of pta-elisa and ifas, cmm strains were detected at a concentration up to 10(5) cfu/ml and 10(3) cfu/ml, respectively. the pcr test with bacterial cell suspensions reached a sensitivity  of 10(3) cfu/ml with our designed primers and 104 cfu/ml with dreier's primer pair.
