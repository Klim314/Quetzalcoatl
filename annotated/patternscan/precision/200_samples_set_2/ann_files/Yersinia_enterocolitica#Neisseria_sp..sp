TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
