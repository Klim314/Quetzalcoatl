TI  == molecular profiling of lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium species  in feces of active racehorses.
AB  == diversity and compositions of the lactobacillus, streptococcus, and bifidobacterium group in the feces of six healthy, actively racing horses (thoroughbreds) were analyzed by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and real-time pcr with primer sets specific for each group. pcr-dgge analysis of the feces showed that lactobacillus equi, lactobacillus johnsonii, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus salivarius, a phylogenetic relative of lactobacillus gastricus, and weissella confusa were predominant in almost all of the feces tested, and streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus was predominant in the streptococcus group. the bifidobacterium group was not detected by single-pcr but atypical species of the  group were found in three of the six thoroughbreds tested by nested-pcr. calculation and estimation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria revealed that lactic acid bacteria were predominant in the feces and bifidobacteria were minor. these results indicate that the community of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in horse feces are unique because of the presence of specific species for horse feces and a minority of the bifidobacterium group. repeated tests of the feces from the same horse over 3 months showed that the diversity and composition of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the feces was basically stable throughout the test period.

TI  == lactobacillus agilis is an important component of the pigeon crop flora.
AB  == aims: to examine the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab: enterococci, streptococci and lactobacilli) in the pigeon crop. methods and results: the crops of 10 pigeons were sampled and inoculated on agar plates for isolation of streptococci, enterococci and lactobacilli. the isolates were identified using tdna-pcr. lactobacillus agilis, a species described in 1981 from municipal sewage, was the dominant component in eight of these pigeon crop sacs. a lactobacillus species related to l. fermentum and l. mucosae but probably not belonging to one of these species was isolated from five birds. three pigeons carried enterococcus cecorum. minor species found were e. columbae, e. faecalis,  e. hirae, l. johnsonii, l. salivarius, and streptococcus gallolyticus. a description is given of the phenotypic characteristics of the l. agilis pigeon strains. conclusions, significance and impact of the study: l. agilis is found to be the main component of the lab flora in the pigeon crop.
