TI  == periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  == background: plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. previously  described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. this is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement  in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. case presentation: the intraoral examination of a 17-year-old turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. the reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and  tooth mobility class i and ii. furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola after therapy. conclusion: adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. this case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.

TI  == intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  == brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. this phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. we compiled a total of  60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. a systematic review of the literature using the  pubmed database was performed. men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. in 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. commonly implicated microorganisms included streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group),  actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. there was an 8.3% mortality rate.  intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. this suggests that hematogenous spread is the  most likely route of dissemination.

TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == relationship of clinical and microbiological variables in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to analyze how metabolic control of type 1 diabetes is related to clinical and microbiological periodontal parameters. material and methods: the study involved 56 subjects aged from 19 to 50 years divided into 2 groups: healthy subjects (the h group), and diabetic (type 1 diabetes) patients with chronic untreated generalized periodontitis (the dm group). the glycosylated hemoglobin value (hba1c) was determined using the unicel dxc 800 synchron system (beckman coulter, usa), and the concentration in blood was measured by the turbidimetric immunoinhibition method. a molecular genetic assay (micro-ident plus, germany) was used to detect periodontopathogenic bacteria in plaque samples. periodontitis was confirmed by clinical and radiological examination. results: fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, and eikenella corrodens were the most frequently found bacteria in dental plaque samples (77.8%, 66.7%, and 33.4%, respectively), whereas aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified 40.7% less frequently in the dm group than in the h group. the strongest relationship was observed between the presence of 2 periodontal pathogens - f. nucleatum and capnocytophaga spp. - and  poorer metabolic control in type 1 diabetes patients (hba1c) and all clinical parameters of periodontal pathology. conclusions: periodontal disease was more evident in type 1 diabetic patients, and the prevalence of periodontitis was greatly increased in subjects with poorer metabolic control.

TI  == real-time pcr quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva samples from  healthy young adults.
AB  == objective: the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. most published real-time pcr assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. the aims of this study were to develop a real-time pcr assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and colony-forming unit (cfu). materials and methods: taqman primers/probe sets were used for the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), and total bacteria. six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals  were determined. the relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and cfu was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial dna and cfu per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. results: fn, ec, and pi were detected  in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for tf, pg, and  aa, respectively. numbers of ec and fn in saliva were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01). the values of dna (fg) per cfu ranged from 64 for ec to 121 for  pg. conclusion: the real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (cfu). clinical relevance: this real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.

TI  == combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. design: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum  and eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the etest. the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. results: synergy, i.e. fici values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two a. actinomycetemcomitans (fici: 0.3), two f.  nucleatum (fici: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one e. corrodens (fici: 0.4) isolates. indifference, i.e. fic indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 p. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by  etest. conclusion: combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. corrodens. synergy was shown for a few strains only.

TI  == microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == oxidative stress and antibody levels to periodontal bacteria in adults: the nagasaki islands study.
AB  == objective: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the tissues supporting the teeth and is caused by subgingival plaque. systemic increases in reactive oxygen species are involved in pathogenesis of periodontitis. this study addressed the relationship between levels of serum oxidative stress and antibodies against putative periodontopathic bacteria and their association with  periodontal conditions, in a community-based study. subjects and methods: serum samples were measured for reactive oxygen metabolite (rom) levels and anti-oxidant capacity. the serum levels of immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and eikenella corrodens (ec) were determined by elisa. results: the participants with greater clinical attachment loss had higher serum rom levels and igg antibody titers to pg. serum rom levels were positively  correlated with antibody titers to pg, pi, and ec. when the participants with greater probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss were used as the dependent variables, high rom levels showed a statistically significant associations in multivariate logistic analyses; the adjusted odds ratios were 2.9 (95% confidence interval = 1.0-8.5) and 6.0 (95% confidence interval = 2.0-17.6), respectively. conclusions: it was concluded that an increased oxidative stress may be detrimental to periodontitis in japanese community-dwelling adults.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

TI  == assessment of interleukin-6 receptor inhibition therapy on periodontal condition  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: overproduction of interleukin (il)-6 may play a pathologic role in rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and chronic periodontitis (cp). the present study assesses il-6 receptor (il-6r) inhibition therapy on the periodontal condition of patients with ra and cp. methods: the study participants were 28 patients with ra and cp during treatment with il-6r inhibitor, and 27 patients with ra and cp during treatment without il-6r inhibitor. periodontal and rheumatologic parameters and serum levels of cytokine and inflammatory markers and immunoglobulin g against periodontopathic bacteria were examined after medication with il-6r inhibitor for 20.3 months on average (t1) and again 8 weeks later (t2). results: no differences were observed between the groups in any parameter values at t1, except for serum il-6 levels. the anti-il-6r group showed a significantly greater decrease in gingival index, bleeding on probing (bop), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and serum levels of il-6 and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-3 from t1 to t2 than the control group (p <0.05).  a significant correlation was found between changes in serum anticyclic citrullinated peptide levels and those in pd and cal in the anti-il-6r group (p <0.05), whereas both groups exhibited a significant association between changes in serum mmp-3 levels and those in bop (p <0.05). conclusion: changes in periodontal and serum parameter values were different between the patients with ra and cp during treatment with and without il-6r inhibitor.

TI  == construction of new cloning, lacz reporter and scarless-markerless suicide vectors for genetic studies in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == to elucidate the putative function of a gene, effective tools are required for genetic characterization that facilitate its inactivation, deletion or modification on the bacterial chromosome. in the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the escherichia coli/aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans shuttle vector pygk was determined, allowing us to redesign and construct a new shuttle cloning vector, pjt4, and promoterless lacz transcriptional/translational fusion  plasmids, pjt3 and pjt5. plasmids pjt4 and pjt5 contain the origin of replication necessary to maintain shuttle vector replication. in addition, a new suicide vector, pjt1, was constructed for the generation of scarless and markerless deletion mutations of genes in the oral pathogen a. actinomycetemcomitans. plasmid pjt1 is a puc-based suicide vector that is counter-selectable for sucrose sensitivity. this vector does not leave antibiotic markers or scars on the chromosome after gene deletion and thus provides the option to combine several mutations in the same genetic background. the effectiveness of pjt1 was demonstrated by the construction of a. actinomycetemcomitans isogenic qseb single deletion (deltaqseb) mutant and lsrrk double deletion mutants (deltalsrrk). these new vectors may offer alternatives for genetic studies in a. actinomycetemcomitans and other members of the hacek (haemophilus spp., a. actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, and kingella kingae) group of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == assessment of the plasma/serum igg test to screen for periodontitis.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a silent infectious disease prevalent worldwide and affects lifestyle-related diseases. therefore, efficient screening of patients is essential for general health. this study was performed to evaluate prospectively  the diagnostic utility of a blood igg antibody titer test against periodontal pathogens. oral examination was performed, and igg titers against periodontal pathogens were measured by elisa in 1,387 individuals. the cut-off value of the igg titer was determined in receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and changes in periodontal clinical parameters and igg titers by periodontal treatment were evaluated. the relationships between igg titers and severity of periodontitis were analyzed. the best cut-off value of igg titer against porphyromonas gingivalis for screening periodontitis was 1.682. both clinical parameters and igg titers decreased significantly under periodontal treatment. igg titers of periodontitis patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls, especially in those with sites of probing pocket depth over 4 mm. multiplied cut-off values were useful to select patients with severe periodontitis. a blood igg antibody titer test for porphyromonas gingivalis is useful to screen hitherto chronic periodontitis patients.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7 +/- 7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8 +/- 8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == actinobacillus endocarditis associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
AB  == infective endocarditis can be associated with complex clinical presentations, sometimes with a difficult multi-disciplinary management. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans belongs to the haemophilus species, actinomycetemcomitans,  cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella species group, responsible for 5% to 10% of infective endocarditis in native heart valves. these organisms have slow fastidious growth pattern, often associated with negative cultures, and cause systemic embolism with abscess formation. the authors present the case of a 59-year-old man, admitted due to fever of unknown origin, with a personal history of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and recent dental manipulation. the diagnosis of mitral valve's endocarditis was established after  a transoesophageal ecocardiography, with a late isolation of a actinomycetemcomitans in blood culture. despite the institution of antibiotic therapy, the patient suffered from multiple episodes of septic embolism: skin, mucosae, cerebral abscesses, spondylodiscitis and uveitis. he was submitted to heart surgery with miectomy and replacement of the native mitral valve by a mechanical prosthesis, while on antibiotics.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == kingella kingae endocarditis: a rare case of mitral valve perforation.
AB  == kingella kingae, a hacek (haemophilus parainfluenzae, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, aggregatibacter aphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, kingella kingae) organism, is a common resident of the upper airway in children; it has been associated with endocarditis in children with pre-existing heart conditions. this case report describes k. kingae endocarditis  leading to valvular damage in a previously healthy 18-month-old child. our patient developed a k. kingae bacteremia that was later complicated by meningitis, septic embolic stroke, and endocarditis of the mitral valve, leading  to perforation of the posterolateral leaflet. the patient was initially treated conservatively with cefotaxime but, subsequently, required a mitral valve repair  with a pericardial patch and annuloplasty. this report draws attention to the need for clinicians to be aware of the potentially serious complications of k. kingae infection in young children. if k. kingae infection is suspected then therapy should be initiated promptly with a beta-lactam, followed by early echocardiographic assessment. this case also highlights the lack of specific guidelines available for k. kingae endocarditis.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == influence of topography and hydrophilicity on initial oral biofilm formation on microstructured titanium surfaces in vitro.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. materials and methods: nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces israelii, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus sanguinis were tested on ti surfaces: pretreatment (pt [r(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (a [r(a) <0.8 mum]), a modified to be hydrophilic (moda), sand-blasted/acid-etched (sla [r(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic sla (modsla). disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (cm) or human saliva (hs). the total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with cm compared with the samples incubated with hs. pt, sla, and modsla exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in cm, whereas sla and modsla had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in hs. the proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: sla and modsla increased the proportion of species like a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of a. israelii and p. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. conclusions: the initial biofilm formation and composition were affected  by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: in recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. the available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. the main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery  atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. methods: atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial dna was extracted. to obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16s ribosomal-rna gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a nested pcr with specific primers for the target bacteria  was performed next. statistical tests included the chi(2) test. results: forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. all of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. the bacterial species most commonly found was porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%;  28 of 42), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42),  eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). the simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, the presence of dna from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == background: a limited number of studies suggest a prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra); however, results are inconsistent. the aim of this study is to investigate clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with ra. methods: sixty-six patients with ra, aged 49.5 +/- 8.4 years, participated in the study. the periodontal classification was assessed with the periodontal screening index (psr/psi) allocated to the following parameters: 1) healthy; 2) gingivitis (psr/psi score 0 to 2, maximum one sextant score; 3) moderate periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 3, maximum one sextant score; or, 4) severe periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 4). pool samples were taken for microbiologic (polymerase chain reaction) analysis for the presence of 11 periodontal pathogens. statistical analysis was by non-parametric analysis of covariance. results: no patients were  periodontally healthy: 24 patients were classified as having gingivitis; 18 patients had moderate periodontitis; 23 patients had severe periodontitis; and one patient was toothless. for most patients, fusobacterium nucleatum (98%), eikenella corrodens (91%), and parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros; 88%) were above the detection threshold. strong periodontal pathogens were less frequently detected: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 16%); porphyromonas gingivalis (58%); and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis, 78%). statistical analysis showed no significant influence of rheumatic factor (p = 0.33) on periodontal classification and on microbiologic parameters (p >0.05). only smoking showed a significant influence (p = 0.0004) on the periodontal classification and in the case of e. corrodens (p = 0.02). conclusions: most patients with ra in this study showed moderate-to-severe periodontitis and the presence of periodontal pathogens. no association was found between rheumatic factor on periodontal classification and microbiologic parameters.

TI  == detection of specific periodontal microorganisms from bacteraemia samples after periodontal therapy using molecular-based diagnostics.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to assess the presence of subgingival pathogens in peripheral blood samples from periodontitis patients before and after scaling and root planing (sc/rp) using nested polymerase chain reaction (nested pcr). materials and methods: peripheral blood samples were obtained from 42 patients with severe generalized chronic or aggressive periodontitis. in each patient, four samples of peripheral blood were drawn at different times: immediately before the sc/rp procedure; immediately after sc/rp; 15 and 30 min. post-sc/rp. blood samples were analysed for bacteraemia with anaerobic culturing and nested pcr, using universal bacterial primers that target the 16s-rrna gene of most bacteria, subsequently re-amplified with specific primers to porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus and prevotella intermedia, using a modified phenol-chloroform method for dna extraction. results: presence of specific periodontal pathogens in peripheral blood after treatment was detected in 54.8% of the patients, in 47.6% with anaerobic culturing and in 19% with nested pcr. in 16.6%, the periodontal pathogens were detected before sc/rp. p. gingivalis and a. actynomicetemcomitans were the pathogens most frequently detected in the bloodstream before and after sc/rp. conclusions: nested pcr demonstrated the presence of dna from periodontal pathogens in blood samples in severe periodontitis patients before, during and after periodontal therapy. the use of these molecular-based techniques may improve the accuracy from the results obtained by haemoculture.

TI  == antibody responses to periodontopathic bacteria in relation to rheumatoid arthritis in japanese adults.
AB  == background: periodontopathic bacteria have been implicated as contributory to the etiology of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). anticyclic citrullinated peptide (ccp) antibodies and rheumatoid factor (rf) were shown to be associated with ra. this study examines whether serum levels of antibodies to periodontopathic bacteria may affect clinical and laboratory profiles of ra. methods: the study participants consisted of 80 patients with ra, and 38 age-, sex-, smoking status-, and periodontal condition-balanced healthy controls. after periodontal and rheumatologic examination, serum levels of immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies  to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and eikenella corrodens (ec) and those of anti-ccp antibodies and rf were determined  by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: patients with ra showed significantly higher levels of anti-pg and anti-ccp antibodies than controls (p = 0.04 and p <0.0001). in contrast, igg responses to aa and ec in patients with ra  were significantly lower than those in controls (p <0.0001 and p = 0.0001). multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association of anti-pg and anti-aa igg responses with ra, after adjustment for age, sex, and smoking (p = 0.005 and p = 0.02). anti-pg titer displayed a significant correlation with rf levels, probing depth, and clinical attachment level (p = 0.03, p = 0.03, and p = 0.02). conclusion: these results suggest that serum levels of anti-pg igg antibodies were associated with ra, and might affect serum  levels of rf and periodontal condition in patients with ra.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of dentifrices on human oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: in vitro testing of antimicrobial agents is an important tool in the testing hierarchy, and may provide interesting insights into their potential clinical efficacy. agents with demonstrable in vitro antimicrobial activity may be effective against the same microorganisms in vivo, whereas agents without demonstrable in vitro antimicrobial activity are unlikely to exhibit in vivo antimicrobial activity. in addition, these methods may also be useful in screening antimicrobial agents in product formulations because such agents with both in vitro and in vivo activity may have reduced antimicrobial effects when formulated into a dentifrice. accordingly, this study examined the in vitro and ex vivo antimicrobial activity of three commercial dentifrices: one formulated with 0.243% sodium fluoride (crest cavity protection toothpaste-regular); one with 0.454% stannous fluoride, sodium hexametaphosphate, and zinc lactate (crest  pro-health), and one with 0.3% triclosan, 2.0% pvm/ma copolymer, and 0.243% sodium fluoride (colgate total). methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each dentifrice was determined for resident oral bacterial species, including bacteria that are associated with dental caries; periodontitis, and oral halitosis. evaluations were performed on individual laboratory strains, and  on oral bacteria from supragingival plaque samples obtained from 10 adults and from oral rinse samples obtained from 18 adults. results: the lowest mics against the oral strains and human samples, i.e., greatest antimicrobial activity, were seen for the triclosan/ copolymer dentifrice. there was, in general, a four-fold  difference in mics between the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and the stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrice. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited periodontal pathogens, such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in ex vivo tests measuring antimicrobial effects, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice substantially inhibited bacterial growth after 30-, 60-, and 120-second exposures compared to the sodium fluoride or stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrices. similarly, in ex vivo tests measuring antimicrobial effects on supragingival plaque biofilms, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice substantially inhibited bacterial growth compared  to the other test dentifrices. conclusion: different in vitro and ex vivo analyses show that the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice has significant antimicrobial activity on oral bacteria, including species causing dental caries, periodontitis, and oral halitosis, and it provides superior efficacy compared to  the stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrice.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

AB  == chronic periodontitis is a highly prevalent endogenous polymicrobial disease. to  better understand the etiology of the disease a quantitative approach is mandatory and real-time pcr is the molecular technique currently preferred to achieve this purpose. taking into account that such a kind of study is still scarce, we aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal microbiota and chronic periodontitis. a total of 60 low-income age-matched female adults, 30 with chronic periodontitis and 30 without periodontal disease, were enrolled. dna obtained from subgingival specimens was used for quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia by real-time pcr.  a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were detected in all subjects, p. gingivalis was observed in 70.0% and 46.6% and p. intermedia in 90.0% and 80.0% of chronic periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy subjects, respectively. p. gingivalis mean count was significantly higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in periodontally healthy individuals. accurate detection and quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens was  feasible using a simple and fast real-time pcr protocol. although p. gingivalis and p. intermedia have been found more commonly in chronic periodontitis patients, no statistical difference was observed between periodontally diseased and healthy groups. quantitative data indicated association between p. gingivalis and chronic periodontitis. however, because of its uneven distribution, it should not be solely taken as a marker of periodontal status.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of commercial dentifrices.
AB  == this investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit  the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest mics and significantly inhibited gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). in the  ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. similarly, the  triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). no significant  differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices  (p > 0.5).

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == subgingival bacterial colonization profiles correlate with gingival tissue gene expression.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the microbiota of the periodontal pocket. we investigated the association between subgingival bacterial profiles and gene expression patterns in gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis. a total of 120 patients undergoing periodontal surgery contributed with a minimum of two interproximal gingival papillae (range  2-4) from a maxillary posterior region. prior to tissue harvesting, subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesial and distal aspects of each tissue sample. gingival tissue rna was extracted, reverse-transcribed, labeled, and hybridized with whole-genome microarrays (310 in total). plaque samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations with respect to 11 bacterial species. random effects linear regression models considered bacterial levels as exposure and expression profiles as outcome variables. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: wide inter-species variation was noted in the number of differentially expressed gingival tissue genes according to subgingival bacterial levels: using  a bonferroni correction (p < 9.15 x 10(-7)), 9,392 probe sets were differentially associated with levels of tannerella forsythia, 8,537 with porphyromonas gingivalis, 6,460 with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, 506 with eikenella  corrodens and only 8 with actinomyces naeslundii. cluster analysis identified commonalities and differences among tissue gene expression patterns differentially regulated according to bacterial levels. conclusion: our findings  suggest that the microbial content of the periodontal pocket is a determinant of  gene expression in the gingival tissues and provide new insights into the differential ability of periodontal species to elicit a local host response.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard dna hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression  of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the  presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral  cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

AB  == conventional culture methods and multiplex pcr, both of which we have been used for a long time in our clinical microbiology laboratory, were compared for their  ability to detect a selected panel of periodontopathic bacteria: aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. tests were performed in a single subgingival sample taken from a periodontal diseased site with a probing depth equal to or greater than 6mm. the results were compared site-by-site, taking into account the quality and the presence or absence of pathogens. 529 samples of subgingival plaque were analysed and the prevalence of  the six species monitored varied in relation to the species itself and the method of detection. the most represented species is f. nucleatum, with a percentage of  positive variability between 44.9% pcr and 46.5% culture test. generally, the lowest prevalence was determined by culture test, with the exception of e. corrodens and f. nucleatum, which, unlike other bacteria, have been seen in higher percentages in culture with respect to pcr. for both methods, there was a  good degree of accuracy in the determination of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, and p. gingivalis. it becomes weak for f. nucleatum and p.  intermedia. both culture and pcr techniques introduced many methodological problems when applied in oral microbiology, but the ideal technique for accurate  detection of pathogens in subgingival plaque samples has yet to be developed.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == a 72-year-old man, having had an artificial valve for almost 20 years now, presented with tiredness that had persisted for several weeks and reported weight loss of 5 kg. in more recent days he experienced fever and cold shivers, and an associated dry cough. bearing in mind the potential for endocarditis, blood cultures were grown. in this, we identified a small, gram-negative rod with a small, smooth, raised colony that grew slowly. we considered a micro-organism from the 'hacek group', which is a group of micro-organisms including haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens, kingella kingae and aggregatibacter (formerly: actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans. more careful observation revealed that the bacteria formed star-shaped colonies, proving that a. actinomycetemcomitans was the cause of this non-acute endocarditis. the patient received antibiotic treatment. because non-acute endocarditis is often caused by hidden abnormalities in the mouth or teeth and a. actinomycetemcomitans plays an important role in severe cases of peridontitis, a dental surgeon was consulted. the dental surgeon diagnosed multifocal peridontitis and treated the patient, who was able to leave the hospital after 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms  for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. material and methods: twenty strains  of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and human beta defensin-3. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to ll-37 than the others (p=0.004). the susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on  the species but not on the strains. the periodontopathic bacteria, especially actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003).  in addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. conclusion: our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some  periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == the detection of eight putative periodontal pathogens in adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients: an institutional study.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is a commonly prevalent problem faced alike by both  the developed and third world countries but showing wide variations in prevalence and severity across different geographical areas. the purpose was to identify actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), ekinella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), bacteroides forsythus (bf), treponema denticola (td) and fusobacterium nucleatum  (fn) in indian adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: paper points were used to collect the sample from 28 sites in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis (8 healthy/20 diseased sites) patients and dna analysis done. the categorical data was analysed by fishers exact test and difference in the clinical parameters was tested by mann-whitney test. results: in healthy sites of adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients, aa, ec, bf and aa, pg, pi, td, fn were detected respectively. however, when diseased and healthy sites were compared in  both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients respectively, only pg( p =0.004), cr( p =0.04), fn( p =0.014) and pg( p =0.002),  cr( p =0.02), fn( p =0.008) were statistically significant. conclusion: the prevalence of the microorganisms correlate with the clinical parameters like probing depth and bleeding on probing as seen in the japanese and western periodontitis patients' population.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  == objective: we analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species  known as the red complex (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. methods: one hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were  randomly selected from patients treated at the pedodontic clinic of osaka university dental hospital. saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. genomic dna was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was the most  frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by c. sputigena, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis, while c. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola in the children. the  detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. conclusions: our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.

TI  == caspase activation is involved in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis, a common infectious disease, is initiated by various gram-negative bacteria and characterized by the destruction of the periodontal tissue. here, we investigated the role of caspases, intracellular proteases that are the key mediators of apoptosis. we show that activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7 is considerably enhanced in gingival tissue from patients with periodontitis. we also demonstrate in in vitro experiments that various periodontopathic bacteria exert a direct growth-suppressing effect and, moreover, can trigger a host-mediated cytotoxic activity involving the cd95 death receptor. our data suggest that caspase activation is a prominent feature in periodontitis-associated tissue injury.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == adjunctive antimicrobial therapy of periodontitis: long-term effects on disease progression and oral colonization.
AB  == background: this study assessed the long-term effects of adjunctive antimicrobial therapy on periodontal disease progression and oral colonization. methods: patients with previously untreated chronic periodontitis and subgingival actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and/or porphyromonas gingivalis were randomly assigned to subgingival scaling without (control group) or with systemic amoxicillin plus metronidazole and chx irrigation (test group). relative attachment levels were determined and subgingival and mucosal plaque samples were taken at baseline, at 10 days (plaque only) and at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months following initial therapy. during maintenance therapy, patients received supragingival debridement only. results: after 24 months, the 18 test group patients showed at sites with initial probing depths (pd) > or =7 mm a significantly (p <0.05) higher frequency of 2 mm or more attachment gain (37.3% +/- 4.6%) and lower frequency of attachment loss (7.2% +/- 3.1%) compared to the  17 controls (8.2% +/- 3.9% and 19.1% +/- 13.1%, respectively). compared to controls, the intraoral prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (up to 18 months)  and p. gingivalis (up to 3 months) decreased and that of eikenella corrodens (at  10 days) increased in test patients (p <0.05). in both treatment groups, the detection frequency of tannerella forsythensis decreased transiently, while an overall increase was recorded for treponema ssp. conclusions: over the 24-month period, a single course of the administered adjunctive antimicrobial therapy led  to a relative risk reduction of 62% for attachment loss at deep sites. however, with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans, it failed to induce long-term changes in the prevalence profiles of oral colonization.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

TI  == killing of periodontopathogenic bacteria by photodynamic therapy.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate a new approach for killing periodontopathogenic bacteria using photodynamic therapy (pdt). methods: in this  study, we investigated the photosensitizers chlorin e6, blc 1010, and blc 1014 by three different methods for their effect in pdt on the viability of periodontopathogenic bacterial species. the methods included examination of inhibition zones on agar plates, determination of colony-forming units (cfu), and the use of a bacterial viability kit. results: using the cfu method, we were able to demonstrate that the anaerobic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga gingivalis can be photoinactivated completely by illumination with an intensity of 5.3 j/cm2 in the presence of 10 microm chlorin e6 and 10 microm blc 1010. with the photosensitizers chlorin e6 and blc 1010, we were able to induce zones of inhibition on agar plates. blc 1014 failed to produce a zone of inhibition. the results of the bacterial viability test also showed that the photosensitizer blc 1014 provides the lowest photodynamic effect in comparison to the others. conclusion: the data collected to date suggest that photodynamic therapy with chlorin e6 and blc 1010 is advantageous for suppressing periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == microbiologic diagnostics at titanium implants.
AB  == background: the microbiota found at periimplant lesions have been shown to contain putative periodontal pathogens as well as opportunistic species such as staphylococcus spp, enterics, and candida spp. therefore, a microbiologic diagnosis may be of value as guidance before treatment of such lesions. purpose:  the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of some putative pathogens associated with long-term followed-up cases using two different microbiologic procedures. materials and methods: fifteen subjects contributed with plaque samples from teeth and implants; these were analyzed with respect to 18 putative  periimplant pathogens using cultural methods and a deoxyribonucleic acid dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: the number of individuals positive for the analyzed pathogens was similar in samples taken from teeth and implants when analyzed with the dna-dna hybridization technique. when comparing detection frequency by culture procedure and by "checkerboard" technique at implants, the number of individuals positive for these species was lower with the traditional culture technique than with the checkerboard analyses. using a higher cutoff point (> or = 4) with the checkerboard technique, the number of positive individuals was generally lower than that found with the culture technique. when  comparing the techniques on an implant site level, the prevalence obtained by culture was lower for all analyzed species. if the specific species were present  in the samples analyzed by the checkerboard technique, they were present only in  every second sample analyzed with the culture technique. the high specificity values showed that if the checkerboard technique did not detect any porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, or fusobacterium nucleatum, the bacteria were also undetectable by the culture technique. the two methods therefore did not overlap but did supplement each other. conclusions: based on the current results it is recommended that the technique used when analyzing microbiota around titanium implants should be a combination of the two protocols mentioned as they seem to give the most comprehensive outcome when used together.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == gingival colonization with selective hacek microbes in children with congenital heart disease.
AB  == it was previously shown that children with congenital heart disease (chd) harbored hemophilus, actinobacillus, cardiobacter, eikenella, and kingella (hacek) microbes to a greater extent and had more severe gingival inflammation than a normal group of children. the purpose of this study was to determine if hacek microbes are more prevalent in children with chd than in normal children when there is no difference in gingival inflammation. two groups of 12 children were matched with respect to gingival inflammation. each child had a gingival index recorded as described by massler. the experimental group consisted of 12 children with chd 2.5-10 years old (average 5.5) and the control group consisted  of 12 healthy children 2-13 years old (average 5.6). subgingival samples were obtained and cultured for hacek microbes. fischer's exact test was performed with the significance level defined at p<0.05. the average gingival indices for the experimental and control groups were 6.5 and 6.4, respectively (n.s.). nine of 12 children with chd had eikenella corrodens (e.c.) compared to 3/12 control patients ( p<0.05). three of 12 chd patients but no control patient had actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (n.s.). there were no significant differences in e.c. or a.a. presence between cyanotic and acyanotic chd patients. this study found that the greater extent of specific hacek microbes harbored by children with chd is not associated with cyanosis or the degree of gingival inflammation. further study is needed to delineate fully the medical significance of this observation.

TI  == serum phenytoin concentration and igg antibody titre to periodontal bacteria in patients with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

TI  == determination of eight selected periodontal pathogens in the subgingival plaque of maxillary first molars in japanese school children aged 8-11 years.
AB  == to prevent the onset or progression of periodontitis, we must understand when periodontal pathogens are first harbored and how they develop the biofilm that causes periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between clinical status and selected periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque in school children. this study was conducted with 95 school children, 8-11 years old. the presence and distribution of eight selected periodontal pathogens sampled from the maxillary right first molar were determined by an indirect immunofluorescent technique and compared with clinical  parameters. of the 95 sites sampled, only one site had all eight pathogens and five sites did not have any of the eight pathogens. the mean number of positive pathogens per site was 3.5 +/- 1.8 and mean percentage of positive pathogens was  3.82 +/- 4.22%. the number and total percentage of positive pathogens were strongly correlated with the plaque index (pi). in addition, the number of positive pathogens was correlated to the presence of subgingival calculus. the most frequently found pathogens were campylobacter rectus (84.2%) and eikenella corrodens (83.2%), and the least, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype c (7.4%). of the eight pathogens, the frequency and distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis were significantly correlated with pi and the presence of calculus. in addition, seven sites with both p. gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus showed a  correlation with gingival inflammation. in conclusion, the presence of p. gingivalis or p. gingivalis and b. forsythus may be a risk marker to be sought in screening for the onset of periodontal disease.

TI  == stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  == the placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries  or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. thirty-two metallic brackets and 24  ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization, which uses dna probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. the significance of differences between groups was determined using the  mann-whitney u-test. results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing s mutans and l acidophilus spp counts. mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. this study showed higher mean counts of treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, streptococcus anginosus, and eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of eikenella corrodens, campylobacter showae, and selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.

AB  == experimental studies have shown that intraoral transmission of bacteria can occur. of course, the question arises as to how this transmission may happen. in  this study, the contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens is examined and compared to the microbial load of the periodontal pockets. in ten untreated chronic periodontitis patients, four interdental sites were professionally brushed with one interdental brush per patient. subsequently, samples from the depths of the pockets (of the specific interdental sites) were obtained with paper-points. the interdental brush samples and the samples of the  subgingival plaque, obtained by the pooled paper-points, were processed for dark-field microscopy examination as well as anaerobic culturing. the results showed that, although significant differences could be found between the brushes  and paper-points with direct microscopy, the culturing did not uncover many differences. on the contrary, the detection frequencies of specific bacterial species were almost the same between the two. the total anaerobic colony-forming  units (cfu), p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and e. corrodens found on the brushes showed a significant correlation with the subgingival plaque samples (p<0.005). these results suggest that, in untreated situations, interdental brushes are contaminated relatively easily by putative periodontopathogens in numbers comparable to their presence in periodontal pockets. this contamination could be  a factor in the intraoral spread of bacteria.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation on root surfaces: an  in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: this in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial effects of 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation on root surfaces. materials and methods: the study  used 125 extracted teeth which were divided into 2 groups (a, b) of 40 teeth and  3 groups of 15 teeth (c, d, e). a defined and similarly-sized area of the root surface was inoculated with an aliquot of 7 microl of a bacterial suspension of escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 43719), eikenella corrodens (atcc 51724), or peptostreptococcus micros (atcc 33270). subsequently, the samples from each group were further divided into subgroups which have been irradiated either with 55, 75, and 105 (group a, b) or 55 and 75 (group c, d, e) laser pulses. 1 subgroup of each group was left untreated as control. the source of laser radiation was an er:yag laser emitting pulsed infrared radiation at a wavelength of 2.94 microm. the number of bacteria was determined using the surface spread plate technique. the statistical analysis was performed using anova followed by the scheffe-test.  results: depending on the number of laser pulses the bacterial load in the e. coli group was reduced by the er:yag laser radiation after exposure to 105 laser  pulses to 5.5% of the initial count and that in the staph. aureus group to 15.1%. the number of bacteria in case of a. actinomytemcomitans was reduced to 8.3%, in  case of e. corrodens to 3.0% and in case of p. micros to 22.0% after application  of 75 laser pulses. conclusion: besides the selective removal of plaque and calculus, the 2.94 microm er:yag laser radiation causes reduction in bacteria on  root surfaces.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == associations between serum antibody levels to periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == background: the role of antibodies to periodontal microorganisms in the development of periodontal tissue destruction is still unclear. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum levels of igg, iga, and igm antibodies to 6 periodontal microorganisms and clinical subtypes of varying severity of early-onset periodontitis (eop) in young african american adults. methods: the study group consisted of 159 african americans aged 19 to 25 years (mean 22 years) and included 97 cases with eop and 62 controls with no clinical signs of eop. these subjects were selected from a nationally representative sample of adolescents who received an oral examination as part of the national survey of oral health of united states children in 1986-1987. the group was examined clinically a second time 6 years later and blood samples were collected. serum levels of igg, iga, and igm reactive to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed. results: serum levels of igg and iga antibody reactive to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans and iga antibody to p. intermedia were significantly higher in generalized eop cases compared to healthy controls. igm antibody levels did not show any significant associations with eop for any of the 6 bacterial species tested. there were no significant differences in antibody levels between  controls and the 13 subjects in our study who were classified with localized eop. conclusions: the findings suggest that antibodies to p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of eop. substantial longitudinal studies that monitor antibody levels and avidity prior to disease onset, during progression, and following clinical intervention will be necessary to fully understand the role of this component of the immune response in protection versus tissue destruction and the  potential use in eop risk assessment and disease management.

TI  == the localization of periodontal-disease-associated bacteria in human periodontal  pockets.
AB  == some gram-negative anaerobes are associated with the incidence and progression of periodontal disease. in periodontal pockets, however, the localization of those bacteria is unknown. we investigated the localization of 5 bacterial species in human periodontal pockets. fifteen teeth with a part of periodontal pockets from  10 adult periodontitis patients were obtained, and the localization of bacteria was examined immunohistochemically. positive reactions with anti-prevotella nigrescens antibody were located at the epithelium-associated plaque area in the  middle pocket zones. in the middle and deep pocket zones, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola were especially localized in the unattached plaque area,  but eikenella corrodens was observed in the tooth-attached plaque area. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, detected in 2 of 15 samples examined, was found in the unattached plaque area, in the middle pocket zone. the present findings indicated that the 5 bacterial species examined localized at distinct regions in human periodontal pockets.

TI  == molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  == fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. type i fimbriae and p pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type ii secretion system. curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. oral pathogens,  such as eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. these fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens have type 4-like  fimbriae, whereas p. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. to date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. the putative major fimbrial subunits, fima and fimp of a. naeslundii and fap1 of s. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. the presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both s. parasanguis and a. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. the model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in down's syndrome.
AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == increased susceptibility to gingival colonization by specific hacek microbes in children with congenital heart disease.
AB  == it is well established that infective endocarditis (ie) involving the hacek (hemophilus, actinobacillus, cardiobacter, eikenella, kingella) group of microbes occurs in patients with congenital heart defects (chd) and in those with prosthetic grafts. dental caries and gingival disease have been presumed to be the focus of microbial shedding. the purpose of this study was to determine if children with chd had a more severe gingival inflammatory condition and harbored  the hacek group of microbes to a greater extent than normal children. two groups  of 12 age and sex matched children were selected for this study. the experimental group consisted of twelve children with chd, 1-1/2 to 8 years of age. the control group consisted of 12 healthy children 2 to 8 years of age. each child had a gingival index score recorded as described by massler. subgingival cultures were  obtained. gingival samples were cultured for hacek microbes and total streptococcus (spp) using standard techniques. fisher's exact test was performed  with significance defined at p < 0.05. children with chd had more severe gingival inflammatory index than the control group (p < 0.05). 8/12 chd patient had actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) as compared with 2/12 controls (p < 0.05). furthermore, all cyanotic chd patients (4/4) had a.a. whereas, only 2/12 controls did (p < 0.05). 4/12 chd patients harbored eikenella corrodens (e.c.) compared to 1/12 controls (n.s.). there was no significant difference in colonization with e.c. or a.a. between cyanotic and acyanotic patients. no significant difference in total streptococcus (spp) was found between the two groups. this study suggests that children with chd have a more severe gingival inflammatory index and are colonized with specific hacek microbes more so than normal children.

TI  == comparison of microbial composition in the subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions.
AB  == it has been reported in the literature that certain species of bacteria (periodontopathogens) present in the subgingival plaque are associated with destructive periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to investigate and compare the presence and proportional distribution of periodontopathogens in the  subgingival plaque of adult crowded versus non-crowded dental regions. thirty adult patients with anterior dental crowding were selected from the orthodontic clinic of the university of pennsylvania. after orthodontic records were taken and the periodontal examination was performed, subgingival plaque samples were collected from crowded (experimental) and contralateral non-crowded regions (control) of each patient. the presence of 9 periodontopathic species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium species, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, and bacteroides forsythus, was determined using culture and immunofluorescence techniques. the bacterial morphotype was also determined by the use of dark-field microscopy. it was found  that supragingival plaque accumulation in crowded regions was significantly greater than in non-crowded regions. analysis of the bacteria showed that the samples from crowded regions consistently contained more species of periodontopathogens than the samples from non-crowded regions. morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in the crowded-region samples. in terms of the presence of individual periodontopathogens, fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, c rectus, and p micros were significantly more common in  the crowded samples than in the non-crowded samples. it was concluded that: (1) more plaque accumulated in crowded areas; (2) more species of periodontopathogens were present in the subgingival plaque of crowded regions; (3) morphologically, more spirochetes and motile rods were present in crowded areas; and (4) fusobacterium species, capnocytophaga species, c rectus, and p micros were present more often in crowded areas than in non-crowded areas (p < 0.05).

TI  == [bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  == strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (pd) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. when the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. the first step  in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. such species namely gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. these factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. the present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.

TI  == detection of putative periodontal pathogens in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and non-diabetes mellitus by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == it has been assumed that there is a relationship between periodontal diseases and diabetes mellitus, however the putative periodontal microorganisms in non-diabetes mellitus (non-dm) individuals and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) patients have not been well studied. in this study, the detection rates of 5 putative periodontal pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, and candida albicans by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) between niddm  and non-dm adults were compared. a total of 246 adults were randomly recruited and periodontal parameters including: plaque index (p1i), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected by sterile curettes from the most diseased and healthy sites based on pd and al. the differences in periodontal parameters and microbiological data in healthy and diseased sites between non-dm and niddm patients were compared by chi-square analysis. the results showed no significant  differences in age, gender, gi, p1i, pd, and prevalence of the 5 microorganisms between the niddm and the non-diabetic groups. however, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans, the prevalence of the periodontal microorganisms tested was significantly higher (p <0.001) in diseased sites than in the healthy sites in both groups. the p1i, gi, pd and al were significantly higher in t. denticola  positive sites than in negative sites. the results suggested that p. gingivalis,  t. denticola, e. corrodens and c. albicans may play important roles in the periodontitis of both niddm and non-dm individuals, however the etiology of periodontitis in both groups may not be different from each other.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

TI  == longitudinal study of dental implants in a periodontally compromised population.
AB  == background: the purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine the clinical  status and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of dental implants and natural teeth in patients with a history of periodontitis. methods: twenty-five partially edentulous patients treated for moderate to advanced adult periodontitis and having a total of 42 implants participated in this 3-year study. the assessment of clinical status was done 1, 2, and 3 years after prosthetic loading (t1, t2, and t3, respectively). clinical parameters evaluated  included probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), gingival index (gi), and plaque index (pi). the subgingival microbiota at peri-implant and periodontal sites were analyzed at t1 and t2. results: no significant difference  in clinical parameters between implants and teeth and within the 2 groups between different time points was observed through the study. pd and cal measurements of  sampled periodontal and peri-implant sites did not show any statistically significant difference through the study and between the 2 groups. pi of sampled  periodontal sites showed a statistically significant improvement during the study. from the morphological observation of the subgingival microbiota, a significant difference in the composition of motile rods between implants and teeth was found at t1. there were no differences detected in the subgingival microbiota, culturally identified at peri-implant and periodontal sites for the duration of the study. conclusions: in conclusion, implants were colonized by the indigenous periodontal microbiota and were well maintained in patients with a history of periodontitis. no significant association between progressing or non-progressing periodontal or peri-implant sampled sites in terms of loss of attachment and infection with at least one of the searched periodontal pathogens  was found, suggesting that the presence of putative periodontopathogens at peri-implant and periodontal sites may not be associated with future attachment loss or implant failure.

TI  == microbiological features of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. the syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. this report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with papillon-lefevre syndrome. clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. in samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus by a nested-pcr detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. major cultivable bacteria included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were identified by pcr analysis. the patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the papillon-lefevre syndrome patient. the father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but  not epstein-barr type 1 virus. we hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with a. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
AB  == background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with  scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.

TI  == a 15-month evaluation of the effects of repeated subgingival minocycline in chronic adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: a double-blind, randomized, parallel, comparative study was designed  to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of subgingivally administered minocycline ointment versus a vehicle control. methods: one hundred four patients (104) with moderate to severe adult periodontitis (34 to 64 years of age; mean 46 years) were enrolled in the study. following scaling and root planing, patients were randomized to receive either 2% minocycline ointment or a matched vehicle control. study medication was administered directly into the periodontal pocket with a specially designed, graduated, disposable applicator at baseline; week 2;  and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. scaling and root planing was repeated at months 6 and 12. standard clinical variables (including probing depth and attachment level) were evaluated at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. microbiological sampling using dna probes was done at baseline; at week 2; and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. results: both treatment groups showed significant  and clinically relevant reductions in the numbers of each of the 7 microorganisms measured during the entire 15-month study period. when differences were detected, sites treated with minocycline ointment always produced statistically significantly greater reductions than sites which received the vehicle control. for initial pockets > or =5 mm, a mean reduction in probing depth of 1.9 mm was seen in the test sites, versus 1.2 mm in the control sites. sites with a baseline probing depth > or =7 mm and bleeding index >2 showed an average of 2.5 mm reduction with minocycline versus 1.5 mm with the vehicle. gains in attachment (0.9 mm and 1.1 mm) were observed in minocycline-treated sites, with baseline probing depth > or =5 mm and > or =7 mm, respectively, compared with 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm gain at control sites. subgingival administration of minocycline ointment  was well tolerated. conclusions: overall, the results demonstrate that repeated subgingival administration of minocycline ointment in the treatment of adult periodontitis is safe and leads to significant adjunctive improvement after subgingival instrumentation in both clinical and microbiologic variables over a 15-month period.

TI  == comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  == background: the purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. methods: a total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (imp) were received at the microbiology testing laboratory (mtl) of the university of pennsylvania over a 2-year period. paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by mtl from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (ap) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (rp). patients'  mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. culture was used for detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, p. micros, capnocytophaga and  fusobacterium sp., enteric gram-negative rods, enterococcus and staphylococcus sp., and yeast. p. gingivalis and b. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. results: the most frequently detected microorganisms from imp were b. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), fusobacterium (41%), p. micros (39%), and p. gingivalis (27%). recovery levels (mean +/- sd) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. the most frequently detected organisms for ap were b. forsythus (83%), fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), p. gingivalis (59%), p. micros (51%), and e. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. corresponding data for rp were b. forsythus (85%), fusobacterium (83%), p. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), c. rectus (56%), and p. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively.  conclusions: these results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in adult twins.
AB  == background: both environmental and genetic factors are known to influence clinical measures of periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors similarly influence the presence of specific periodontal bacteria in subgingival plaque. methods: reared-together and reared-apart monozygous (mz) and dizygous (dz) adult twins were examined clinically. demographic and behavioral information was obtained from each subject by questionnaire. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the index teeth,  and the presence of p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum was determined using an immunoassay. results: microbiological and clinical data were available for 169 twin pairs. the subject-based prevalences of the bacteria in the twin groups ranged from 11% for  porphyromonas gingivalis to 40% for f. nucleatum. for all species examined, the concordance rates were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between mz and dz twin groups. these findings were apparent despite similar smoking histories, self-reported oral hygiene practices, and antibiotic use in the twin groups. furthermore, mz twins reared together were not more similar than mz reared-apart  twins with respect to any bacterial species examined. conclusions: these findings suggest that in a population with access to routine dental care, any effects that host genes and the early family environment have on the presence of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque are not apparent in adulthood. most twins with disease in this study had early periodontitis. results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to more advanced disease states.

TI  == relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). methods: thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. within each subject, the ast contents of gcf from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. ast-positive site refers to one that had an ast level > or = 800 microiu. subgingival plaque samples from one ast-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. one site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. culture and immunofluorescence (if) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and porphyromonas gingivalis. logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the ast test and certain specific pathogens. results: the gcf scores and  total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in ast-positive sites than either ast-negative or healthy sites. the prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as c rectus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, p. intermedia, and p. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. in analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the ast test by logistic regression, only p. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. the odds ratio of having a  high proportion of p. gingivalis in the presence of a positive ast test was 1.21. conclusions: the present study showed that at ast-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. although only the correlation of p. gingivalis and ast values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of ast levels in gcf.

TI  == neutrophil response and microbiological findings around teeth and dental implants.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the neutrophil response, measured as both functional and antigenic elastase, around teeth and titanium implants and to relate these findings to the microbiota. the 31 patients included in the study had been treated successfully for total or partial edentulism with titanium implants. crevicular fluid and microbiological samples were taken from 3 sites: 1) crevices around teeth and 2) implants in 16 partially edentulous patients and  3) crevices around implants in 15 edentulous patients. all sites sampled showed similar degrees of inflammation assessed by gingival index and total protein concentration. the samples were analyzed for elastase activity and immunoreactive elastase. the elastase activity was significantly higher in crevices surrounding  implants in partially edentulous patients compared with implants in edentulous patients. the antigenic elastase showed no difference among the 3 sites. gram-positive cocci were the main bacterial species in all 3 groups. edentulous patients tended to have lower frequency of black pigmenting anaerobes. no correlation of analyzed bacteria and elastase activity was found between the 3 sites. this study indicates that, despite a similar appearance of clinical parameters and absence of significant differences in the microbiota, the inflammation around implants in partially edentulous patients induces a stronger  neutrophil response than does the inflammation around implants in edentulous patients.

TI  == microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (eop) patients were first examined for the ast levels in gcf by the periogard periodontal tissue monitor. to be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 ast positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (ast+, cic+)  and 1 ast negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (ast-, cic-). in 15 eop patients who met the entry criteria, 30 ast+, cic+ sites (1st group) and 19 ast-, cic- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. certain microbial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. parallel to the ast levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). within the scope of this study, ast activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. these findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of  the ast test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those  that are inflamed, but not progressing.

TI  == analysis of serum antibody responses to periodontopathogens in early-onset periodontitis patients from different geographical locations.
AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == severity of localized juvenile periodontitis as related to polymorphonuclear chemotaxis and specific microbial isolates.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine if an association exists  between severity of localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) and impairment of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) chemotaxis and/or colonization by specific microbial isolates; (b) to determine if the number of specific microbial isolates, i.e., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus correlates to clinical severity of sites with ljp. thirty-six first molars in nine subjects with ljp were examined. a clinical severity score was computed based on attachment level and vertical bone loss. the mean score of the four sites was designated as the clinical severity score for each subject. a dna probe was used to quantitate colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, e. corrodens,  and c. rectus. the chemotaxis of isolated peripheral blood pmns was measured in boyden chambers using the leading front technique. it was found that the clinical severity score ranged from 7.8 for mild involvement to 32.5 for severe ljp. the chemotaxis result for each patient (micron/90 min) was expressed as a percentage  of the value for a paired healthy control and ranged from 40% to 104%. four of the nine subjects had chemotaxis values less than 70% of control. linear regression analysis showed: (a) no significant correlation between pmn chemotaxis and severity of ljp in subjects (r = .14); (b) a significant correlation (r = 0.43) between severe sites with ljp and number of specific microbial isolates. sites with severe ljp had present at least five different microbial isolates as compared with non-severe sites (p < .05). no particular trend of colonization by  periodontopathogens was seen in non-severe sites. further, severe sites of ljp displayed a statistically significant greater colonization by p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and c. rectus than did non-severe sites (p < .05). it may be concluded that neither the degree of pmn chemotactic impairment nor a. actinomycetemcomitans is a reliable indicator of the severity of ljp.

TI  == dental plaque flora of the dog with reference to fastidious and anaerobic bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == animal bite wounds are amongst the most common types of traumatic injuries in humans. the organisms isolated from these wounds generally reflect the oral flora of the biting animal, and may be fastidious in nature and difficult to identify.  this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas and prevotella spp. in supragingival dental plaque collected from the right maxillary canine and carnassial teeth and the right mandibular canine tooth of dogs. in part one of the study, 30 dogs were used. e. corrodens was found in 62% of these dogs and 44% of individual plaque samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the dogs sampled. in part two, 34 dogs were used to determine the prevalence of the black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (porphyromonas and prevotella spp.). porphyromonas gingivalis was present in 68% of these dogs and 47% of individual plaque samples. prevotella intermedia was present in 44% of the dogs and 23% of individual plaque samples. the recently described porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas salivosa, porphyromonas cangingivalis, porphyromonas cansulci, porphyromonas crevioricanis and prevotella denticola species were isolated from only 9%, 6%, 3%, 3%, 3% and 3% of dogs respectively. porphyromonas gingivicanis was not isolated from any of the animals sampled. in conclusion, black-pigmented  anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 91% of the animals sampled and therefore constitute a significant risk with respect to bite wound infections. it is also suggested that the prevalence of e. corrodens in wound infections has been underestimated in previous reports because of use of inappropriate techniques for detecting this organism.

TI  == subgingival distribution of periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis and  their susceptibility to minocycline-hcl.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

AB  == there have been no reports on the relationship of subgingival temperature to specific gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) components. therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether there was any relationship between subgingival temperature and gcf levels of neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), beta-glucuronidase (bg), interleukin-1 alpha (il-1), and interferon alpha (ifn). furthermore, another objective was to confirm an association of subgingival temperature with clinical parameters and specific subgingival plaque micro-organisms as has been reported earlier. 27 human subjects each having healthy (n = 50), gingivitis (n = 59) and periodontitis (n = 53) sites were evaluated. the plaque index (pi), subgingival temperature, probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding index and gingival index were measured. gcf was  sampled following the measurement of the pi and removal of the supragingival plaque. gcf samples were assayed for the enzymes ne, bg, mpo and the cytokines ifn-alpha and il-1 alpha. a sterile gracey curette was utilized at each sampled site to collect subgingival plaque. the plaque samples were evaluated using an immunoassay. subgingival temperature was found to directly correlate with all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). significant, albeit not large, correlations were found between subgingival temperature and ne (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), mpo (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and bg (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). temperature was found to correlate  positively with e. corrodens (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and f. nucleatum (r = 0.25, p < 0.05) but not with p. intermedia (r = 0.02, p = 0.9), p. gingivalis (r = 0.20, p  = 0.1) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (r = 0.01, p > 0.9). in conclusion, subgingival temperature is correlated with the gcf enzymes, ne, mpo and bg as well as the clinical parameters and specific plaque micro-organisms associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == cross-infection from periodontitis sites to failing implant sites in the same mouth.
AB  == twenty-five tooth and implant sites in nine patients were investigated for the presence of putative periodontopathic organisms, using specific dna probes for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter recta. five of nine patients showed a likelihood of transmission from tooth to implant sites. these patients also showed a high number of putative periodontopathic organisms present in the tooth sites tested.  a significant risk was found of transmitting putative periodontopathic organisms  from periodontitis sites to implant sites in the same mouth. an appropriate clinical protocol needs to be developed to address this issue.

TI  == microbial ecology of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and capnocytophaga spp. in adult periodontitis.
AB  == information on intraoral distribution of putative periodontal pathogens might be  essential for controlling different forms of periodontal disease. colonization may be either promoted or impeded by other bacteria competing in the subgingival  ecosystem. in recent investigations microbial associations between dental organisms have been determined in a multitude of subgingival plaque samples within multiple patients and described by odds ratios, in most circumstances without taking into account the correlated structure of the observations within a single individual. the present investigation had 3 major objectives: (i) to describe the intraoral distribution of some facultatively anaerobic, gram-negative rods, i.e. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens-like organisms and capnocytophaga spp., in a multitude of subgingival and extracrevicular samples of 10 adult subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis; (ii) to analyse possible inconsistencies of microbial associations between these periodontal organisms; and (iii) to determine factors increasing the likelihood of isolating these bacteria in a given subgingival site by employing generalized estimation equation (gee) methods. clinical examinations were carried out at 6 sites of every tooth present. in each subject, 13 extracrevicular (2 cheek mucosa, 3 tongue, 4 gingival, 2 tonsillar samples, 1 palatinal, 1 saliva sample) and between 22 and 44 subgingival samples from deepest sites of every tooth present (n = 296) were selectively cultivated for a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens and capnocytophaga spp. in extracrevicular material, a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and e. corrodens were isolated in 9, 10 and 6 patients, and from 65, 82 and 15% samples, respectively. the organisms were recovered from 51,  62 and 27% subgingival plaque samples, respectively. heterogeneity tests did not  reveal significant inconsistencies of microbial associations between bacteria in  subgingival plaque. mantel-haenszel's odds ratios ranged between 2.0 for a. actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp. and 18.7 for capnocytophaga spp. and e. corrodens. an exchangeable working dependence structure was employed in the gee approach. the odds of isolating a. actinomycetemcomitans was increased by factor 3.7 in 4-6 mm deep pockets, and 9.5 in > or = 7 mm deep pockets. the odds  of presence of e. corrodens was increased by factor 10.8 in the case of presence  of capnocytophaga spp. and 2.1 in the case of presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. capnocytophaga spp. were associated with bleeding on probing and molar sites. presence of e. corrodens was associated with clinical attachment loss but not periodontal probing depth. results of the present study indicated an association of a. actinomycetemcomitans with periodontal pathology.  whereas this organism and capnocytophagae were widely distributed in extracrevicular ecosystems of the mouth, e. corrodens only occasionally appeared  in saliva or on mucous membranes of the oral cavity. in general, gee methods seem to allow to determine factors associated with the presence of periodontal organisms in a multivariate approach and considering the correlated structure of  the data.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens detected by dna probe method in hiv vs non-hiv periodontitis.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to examine the prevalence of selected periodontal pathogens associated with hiv and non-hiv related periodontal lesions. methods: subgingival plaque samples were obtained from both hiv-seropositive and hiv-seronegative patients affected with periodontal disease. dna probes were used to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus. results: a actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and b. forsythus (p < 0.05) were more prevalent in hiv-seronegative patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis. only c. rectus was slightly more prevalent in hiv-seropositive subjects with periodontal diseases, but this was not significant.

TI  == myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  == myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. there are three myeloperoxidase isoforms:  mpo i, mpo ii and mpo iii. we examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga sputigena and streptococcus sanguis. isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-a-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in mpo i and diminished in mpo iii. exceptionally, serum-opsonized a. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests  based upon myeloperoxidase.

TI  == hacek group endocarditis at the riyadh armed forces hospital.
AB  == introduction: fastidious gram-negative organisms classified as the hacek group (haemophilus spp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella spp.) are rare causes of infective endocarditis. case report: in this series, we report six cases of endocarditis in saudi patients occurring between 1990 and 1994 in our hospital, caused by two of the organisms in the hacek group, i.e. cardiobacterium hominis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the clinical features, predisposing factors and treatment  of the patients are briefly described. the microscopic and cultural characteristics of the organisms are described together with the laboratory methods of diagnosis. major findings: hacek endocarditis was frequently associated with prosthetic heart valves or structural heart abnormalities. dental caries or periodontal disease seems to be a predisposing factor. the prognosis of hacek endocarditis is very good as clinical and bacteriological cure were achieved with antibiotic therapy in all our cases except one who required mitral  valve replacement. contrary to previous reports we did not find all the organisms sensitive to penicillin and aminoglycosides. however, all our isolates were sensitive to amoxycillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin. conclusions: laboratory diagnosis of hacek group of organisms requires a high index of suspicion and should be suspected in cases of endocarditis in which fastidious gram-negative coccobacilli are isolated which fail to grow on macconkey agar. empiric therapy should be started in suspected cases with second generation cephalosporins or with ciprofloxacin, until antibiotic sensitivity results become available. antibiotic therapy should be continued for 4-6 weeks. progress and outcome was very good in the series.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.

TI  == short-chain carboxylic acid concentration in human gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which can accumulate in the gingival crevice. it is of no small consequence, therefore, that 1- to 5-mm concentrations of these acids exhibit significant biological activity, including  the ability to alter cell proliferation and gene expression in cells of importance to the periodontium. this communication reports on the in vivo concentrations of propionic and butyric acid in the gingival crevices of periodontal subjects with severe and mild disease. the results indicated that severely diseased subjects exhibited a > 10-fold increase in the mm concentration of these acids when compared with mildly diseased subjects (mean propionic acid-severe = 9.5 +/- 1.8 mm, and mild = 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm; mean butyric acid-severe = 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm, and mild = 0.2 +/- 0.04 mm). these differences (mean +/- se) were significant (p < 0.0001). the propionic and butyric acid concentrations were below detection limits in healthy sites of mildly diseased subjects. the propionic and butyric acid concentrations also associated significantly with clinical measures of disease severity (e.g., pocket depth, attachment level) and  inflammation (e.g., subgingival temperature, % of sites bleeding when probed), and with the total microbial load (all p < 0.05). taken together, these data suggest that short-chain carboxylic acids play a mediating role in periodontal disease pathogenesis.

TI  == the adherence of periodontopathogens to periodontal probes. a possible factor in  intra-oral transmission?
AB  == periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. this study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe  by culturing techniques. it also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing merrit-b probes (with deep indentations) with tps  probes (with smooth surfaces). from the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or  spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the merrit-b probe and 11.3% for the tps probe). the cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (p <  0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored  up to 10(7) cfu. no significant differences could be detected between the probes. when specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all  species, even for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. however, the levels of prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (p < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.

TI  == risk indicators for periodontal disease in a racially diverse urban population.
AB  == a cross-sectional study of 117 subjects from a dental clinic serving a diverse population (i.e., whites, african-americans, native-americans, and asians) was performed to evaluate risk indicators of periodontal disease. gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and subgingival plaque were taken at the same visit from 4 posterior  sites of the most diseased sextant in each subject. age, smoking packyears, beta-glucuronidase (beta g), neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) were significantly (p < 0.05-0.005) correlated with attachment loss.  probing depth was significantly correlated with smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum and prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) (p < 0.05-0.005). mean ne value of whites was lower than the mean ne values of african-americans, native-americans and asians (p < 0.05). whites had a lower mean beta g value compared to african americans, and a lower mean mpo value compared to african americans and native americans. the %s of patients positive for f. nucleatum, p.  intermedia and eikenella corrodens (e. corrodens) were higher in native americans compared to whites. step-wise multiple regression analysis was performed to construct models for the estimation of probing depth and attachment loss. the most parsimonious regression models which had the best r2 values included the following variables and accounted for the indicated % of variability: models 1 and 2: beta g, race, and f. nucleatum accounted for 50% of the variability in mean probing depth and 39% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for  probing depth, respectively; model 3: age, beta g, and f. nucleatum accounted for 53% of the variability in mean attachment loss; model 4: age, ne, and f. nucleatum explained 35% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for attachment loss. the results suggest that age, race, smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are risk indicators for periodontal disease in this racially diverse urban population. regression models  which include multiple variables (i.e., demographic factors, gcf enzymes and periodontopathic bacteria) can be used to estimate periodontal disease status.

TI  == the relationship of gingival crevicular fluid short chain carboxylic acid concentration to gingival inflammation.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (scca; c < or = 5; e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which accumulate in the gingival crevice, and exhibit significant biological activity,  including the ability to alter gene expression. it has been hypothesized that among the activities of sccas are their ability to contribute to gingival inflammation. this concept complements the notion that specific periodontal pathogens are the causative agents of gingival inflammation. to begin testing these 2 hypotheses, we examined the relationship between scca concentrations, specific putative periodontal pathogens, and gingival inflammation in medically healthy periodontally diseased subjects. we reasoned that if sccas and/or specific periodontal pathogens were causative gingival inflammatory agents, gingival inflammation should increase with increasing concentration of the inflammatory mediator. we also recognized that other clinical variables needed to be controlled for, and an objective quantitative assessment of gingival inflammation used. to accomplish these tasks, sites within subjects were stratified by location and pocket depth, and the following quantified: bacterial  presence; scca concentration; and gingival inflammation. the results indicated that gingival inflammation directly and significantly correlated with scca concentrations in the maxillary and mandibular molars, incisors and canines (all  r > or = 0.47; all p < or = 0.015; too few bicuspids were available for complete  analysis). the relationship between gingival inflammation and scca concentration  was best described by a natural log relationship. gingival inflammation did not,  however, correlate positively with either the total number of specific putative periodontal pathogens, or the sum of subsets of these pathogens (-0.31 < or = r < or = 0.39; 0.08 < or = p < or = 0.75) for any of the locations. finally, the scca concentration did not correlate with the level of individual or groups of pathogens. these data, together with historical work and other preliminary data,  support the hypothesis that scca, rather than specific putative periodontal pathogens, may be a causative agent in gingival inflammation. this work may, in part, begin to explain the apparent lack of a direct relationship between current gingival inflammation and the prediction of bacterially mediated periodontal attachment loss.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effect of treatment aimed to suppress actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis below  detection level and prevotella intermedia below 5% of the cultivable periodontal  pocket flora. sixteen patients and a total of 111 periodontal pockets with probing depth > or = 6 mm were included in the study. twelve patients and a total of 77 sites completed the 5-year study. the results demonstrated clinical improvement of probing depth and gain of clinical attachment level of 3.4 mm and  1.2 mm, respectively. treatment to eliminate indicator bacteria continued for 3 years before the aim was fulfilled. in order to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans from a majority of the sites, a combination of surgery and  generalized tetracycline treatment was performed. a recolonization or regrowth of the indicator bacteria exceeding detection levels took place in several sites. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia, alone or in combination, correlated with attachment level change on the individual level. no such correlation was obtained by using presence of plaque, bleeding on  probing, or three other bacteria (campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and  fusobacterium nucleatum) not used as treatment goal markers.

AB  == saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (sam), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated  bone and on various mammalian cell populations. in this study, the relative ability of the sam from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6 and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha has been investigated. the bacteria investigated were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the sam, or of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each sam. all sams demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - mono-mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. however, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each sam when compared on  a concentration basis (w/v). the most active sam was from a. actinomycetemcomitans with those from e. corrodens and p. gingivalis being slightly less active. the least active cytokine-stimulating sams were from c. rectus and pr. intermedia. one major difference between the sams and e. coli lps  was the inability of the former to stimulate hgfs to release il-1 beta or tnf alpha although they could stimulate pbmcs to release these cytokines. this may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.

AB  == in a 12-month multi-center study of 116 adult periodontitis subjects, six putative periodontal pathogens were monitored by dna probe methods in a subset of 31 subjects. monitored species included porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), eikenella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) with an  average detection limit of 1.8 x 10(4) bacterial colony forming units/sample. the microbiological response to four periodontal treatments was studied, one treatment in each quadrant; scaling and root planing (s), scaling and root planing with tetracycline (tc) fiber (sf), a single application of tc fiber (f) and two serial applications of tc fiber (ff). generally two sites were sampled in each quadrant, however, in some quadrants only one site was selected. these treatments were evaluated at baseline; immediately following therapy; and post-treatment at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. the study was conducted with a split-mouth design with no maintenance therapy over a 12-month period. at baseline, 70.8% of sites had detectable fn; 42.9% pg; 63.5% pi; 29.7% ec; 28.3% cr; and 5.5% aa. no significant differences were seen in baseline proportions of  these species between centers. numbers and proportions of detectable pathogens (with the exception of pg) exhibited a triphasic temporal response: a precipitous initial decrease immediately following therapy; a rise in proportions in the 1- to 3-month post-therapy period; and a spontaneous decline in the absence of therapy over the 3- to 12-month period.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == characterization of an antiproliferative surface-associated protein from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which can be neutralized by sera from a proportion of patients with localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == the gentle agitation of suspensions of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, b, or c in saline resulted in the release of a proteinaceous surface-associated material (sam) which produced a dose-dependent inhibition of tritiated thymidine incorporation by the osteoblast-like cell line mg63 in culture. this cell line was sensitive to low concentrations of sam (50% inhibitory concentration, 200 ng/ml for serotype c). immunoglobulin g antibodies  to constituents of the sam were found in the blood of patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp). sera from 9 of 16 patients with ljp significantly neutralized the antiproliferative activity of the sam, while sera from 15 controls, with no evidence of periodontal disease, were unable to neutralize this activity. neutralization was not directly related to the patient's antibody titer to the whole sam. characterization of the antiproliferative activity in the sam demonstrated that it was not cytotoxic and was heat and trypsin sensitive. the active component separated in a well-defined peak in anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) which, when further analyzed by size exclusion hplc, revealed a single active peak, which had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 8 kda. the lipopolysaccharide from a. actinomycetemcomitans was only weakly active. sam from porphyromonas gingivalis w50 and eikenella corrodens nctc 10596 did not exhibit any antiproliferative activity with this cell line, even at concentrations as high as 10 micrograms/ml. this study has shown that sam from a. actinomycetemcomitans contains a potent antiproliferative protein whose activity can be neutralized by antibodies in the  sera from some patients with ljp.

TI  == occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in chile.
AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == effect of periodontal treatments on serum igg antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == serum igg antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis patients were measured at the 1st visit and after various periodontal treatments  with clinically successful improvement, in order to evaluate what kind of factors are associated with changes of serum antibody titers. 20 patients (10 male and 10 female from 23 to 61 years old) with adult, rapidly progressive periodontitis were enrolled in this study. all patients received initial preparation and most of them also underwent surgical procedure. after the treatments, the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 3.72 mm to 1.56 mm. serum samples were collected from patients at the initial and final examinations. serum igg antibody titers against sonicated antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis fdc 381, prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, prevotella loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum atcc 25586, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, eikenella corrodens fdc 1073 and capnocytophaga ochracea # m 12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the mean antibody titers to p. gingivalis and p. intermedia decreased significantly after the treatment as compared to their pretreatment levels. the antibody titer to p. gingivalis, especially, decreased in all of the patients examined. a significant relationship was found between the decreased antibody titer to p. gingivalis and the number of teeth which received periodontal surgery, as well as treatment length, and the relationship between the decreased antibody titer to p. intermedia and the number of extracted teeth was also significant. these results suggest that the changes of serum igg titers against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are related to the suppression of such pathogens in subgingival plague.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == some suspected periodontopathogens and serum antibody response in adult long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics.
AB  == the subgingival microflora and serum antibody response were examined in long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. the material consisted of 9 diabetics aged 40-49 years and 19 aged 50-59 years, 13 non-diabetics aged 40-49 years and 21 aged 50-59 years. the bacterial species  studied (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia) were recovered in diabetics as well as in non-diabetics. significantly more diabetics in both age groups harboured p. gingivalis compared to non-diabetics. prevalence of p. gingivalis was associated  with deepened periodontal pockets among non-diabetics but not among diabetics. in diabetics and non-diabetics, the serum antibody titres for most antigens were similar.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == comparison of the osteolytic activity of surface-associated proteins of bacteria  implicated in periodontal disease.
AB  == objectives: to compare the osteolytic activity of surface-associated material (sam) and lipid a-associated proteins (laps) from periodontopathogenic bacteria.  materials and methods: surface-associated material was extracted from the surface and laps from the cell walls of a range of periodontopathic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. these bacterial fractions were assayed to determine their composition and their capacity to induce bone resorption was determined by use of the neonatal murine calvarial bone resorption assay. results: the sams from e. corrodens and a. actinomycetemcomitans demonstrated bone-resorbing capacity at concentrations as low as 1 ng ml-1 which, given the molecular weights of the active components, is  in the picomolar range of activity. in contrast, the sams from the other three bacteria were significantly less potent and showed a lower efficacy. the laps all showed significant, and similar, capacities to induce bone breakdown. conclusions: this is the first demonstration that lap from periodontopathic bacteria can stimulate bone degradation. the laps from diverse bacteria all produced similar levels of bone-resorbing activity. in contrast, the sam showed significant differences in potency and in efficacy (maximal stimulation). this may mean that in vivo certain periodontopathic bacteria have significantly more bone-resorbing capacity than others and should be therapeutic targets.

TI  == serum antibody response to surface-associated material from periodontopathogenic  bacteria.
AB  == saline extracts of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens contain surface-associated components of these bacteria.  it has been shown that these extracts are potent stimulators of bone resorption in vitro. the possibility that the components of these surface-associated materials (sam) could contribute to the serum immune response in patients with juvenile or adult onset forms of rapidly progressive periodontitis were investigated by direct binding elisa. very high titres of serum igg antibodies to sam from a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp). patients with adult onset rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp) had significantly raised antibody levels to sam from p. gingivalis. both groups of patients had significantly raised levels of antibodies to sam from e. corrodens compared with control sera. thus, not only does solubilized sam have the capacity to induce bone resorption, but it also contributes to the antigenic load on the immune system in ljp and rpp.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

AB  == the clinical efficacy of minocycline in a subgingival local delivery system was evaluated alone (m) or as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (m + srp), in comparison to scaling and root planing (srp) or to no subgingival treatment (notx) in adult periodontitis. fifty-one adult patients with > or = 7 mm periodontal pockets demonstrating the presence by culture of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (p(i)), or actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were randomized into one of the above 4 treatment groups. all sites > or = 5 mm in the most diseased quadrant in each patient received the therapy. other quadrants were not treated. all patients received standardized oral hygiene instructions at the beginning of the study. at 0, 1, 3  and 6 months following therapy the 7 mm experimental sites were evaluated for selected periodontal pathogens by dna probe analysis. at these same time points,  the plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding on probing were evaluated as well  as probing depth and relative clinical attachment level which were assessed by means of an automated probe. probing depth reduction with m + srp was significantly greater than all other groups at one month and significantly greater than notx and srp at 3 months. there were no differences in probing depth reduction among groups at 6 months. at 6 months the gain in clinical attachment level was significantly greater for srp than for either the notx or m groups. the prevalence of pg decreased significantly in the m and m + srp groups at one month.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bone resorbing activity of surface-associated material from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens.
AB  == the results of this study demonstrate that saline extracted surface-associated material (sam) of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens stimulates bone resorption at picomolar concentrations. various inhibitors of known osteolytic mediators--indomethacin, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) and a neutralising antibody to murine tumour necrosis factor (tnf) alpha--were tested to determine the mechanism of action of these sams. bone resorption induced by sam from e. corrodens was slightly inhibited by indomethacin and almost completely inhibited by blocking the action of tnf alpha; that from a. actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly affected by either of these inhibitors.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens with varying metabolic control of diabetes mellitus.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of 5 periodontal pathogens in individuals with diabetes mellitus. subjects (n = 107) 20-70 years of age with type 1 (n = 60) or 2 (n = 47) diabetes mellitus were studied for the  occurrence of the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, e. corrodens, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. subgingival plaque was sampled in  each subject from a single site exhibiting the greatest inflammation. the evaluation of selected periodontal bacterial pathogens was based on an immunoassay utilizing bacterial specific monoclonal antibodies. 35% of the sites  harbored p. gingivalis, 28% f. nucleatum and 21% e. corrodens. a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia were found in less than 10% of the sites. subjects for whom the probing depth at the sampled site was > or = 4 mm were more often found to have detectable pathogens than those with a probing depth < or = 3 mm. diabetic factors such as duration, type and metabolic control of the disease  had no statistically significant effect on the prevalence of these bacteria.

TI  == comparison of dna probe and elisa microbial analysis methods and their association with adult periodontitis.
AB  == the purposes of this study were two-fold: to compare the dna probe and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) microbial identification tests and correlate the levels of microorganisms with adult periodontitis. a single plaque sample were taken from each of 2 sites in 52 patients. twelve of these patients were also sampled during and after treatment. the experimental site had clinical indicators of disease (bleeding on probing, probing and attachment loss of > or = 6 mm) and the contralateral site (control) was clinically healthy. a total of 176 plaque samples were collected, divided, processed, and sent for both types of quantitative microbial analyses. all of these samples were used to compare the dna probe and elisa methods while only the initial 104 pretreatment sites were used to correlate microorganisms/method with clinical indicators of adult periodontitis. dna probes were used to assay for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, and c. rectus. an elisa utilizing monoclonal antibodies was used to assay for p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, t. denticola, and c. rectus. comparison of the two methods revealed that the elisa test identified p. gingivalis and c. rectus significantly more often than the dna probe method and that t. denticola was detected more frequently with the dna probe. the sensitivities and specificities  varied widely among organisms and by test. p. gingivalis, as identified by elisa, had the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.82 respectively) to clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.

TI  == modeling the relationship between clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters and alveolar bone levels in an elderly population.
AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == bactericidal activities of synthetic human leukocyte cathepsin g-derived antibiotic peptides and congeners against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga sputigena.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp. are gram-negative bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease (particularly in individuals with neutrophil defects) and life-threatening systemic infections. they are resistant to many antibiotics of microbial origin but are sensitive to the nonoxidative microbicidal action of neutrophils. these organisms are susceptible to the microbicidal effect of cathepsin g but are killed by two distinct mechanisms. the purpose of this study was to assess their sensitivity to the antibiotic effects of iiggr and hpqynqr, antimicrobial peptides derived from  human neutrophil cathepsin g. the efficacies of the synthetic peptides iiggr and  hpqynqr were tested by single-dose screening, dose-response, and kinetic assays against three representative strains (each) of a. actinomycetemcomitans and capnocytophaga spp. and one strain of eikenella corrodens. strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans were sensitive to iiggr and hpqynqr at equal concentrations (wt/vol), whereas strains of capnocytophaga and e. corrodens were more sensitive  to iiggr than to hpqynqr. these differential antibiotic effects occurred over both time and dose ranges too narrow to be of therapeutic significance but are consistent with the premise that cathepsin g kills these oral bacteria by two distinct mechanisms. except for ivggr, congeners of iiggr, including aiggr, iaggr, iiagr, iigar, iigga, iqggr, ilggr, and i-norleucyl-ggr (inlggr), were microbicidal at 500 micrograms/ml. iiggr-amide exhibited no antibiotic activity.  the d-enantiomer of iiggr, didiggdr, was as potent as iiggr itself. apqynqr exhibited antibiotic activity but somewhat less than hpqynqr. we conclude that charge distribution, but not chirality or net charge, is an important determinant in the antibiotic efficacy of iiggr. moreover, peptide antibiotics derived from cathepsin g may have therapeutic value against periodontal gram-negative, facultative bacteria.

AB  == the purposes of this study were to determine if: 1) an association exists between cigarette smoking and signs of periodontal disease after controlling for the confounding variables of age, sex, plaque, and calculus; 2) the prevalence of 5 bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease differs between smokers and non-smokers; and 3) the presence of any of these bacteria or smoking are associated with a mean proximal posterior probing depth > or = 3.5 mm. plaque, calculus, gingivitis, and probing depth were measured at the proximal surfaces of all teeth in one randomly selected posterior dental sextant in 615 adults. subgingival plaque was sampled from the same sites and assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum. a subsample of non-smokers (n = 126), who were similar to smokers (n = 63) with respect to age,  sex, plaque, and calculus, was randomly drawn from the original sample. these two groups were then compared on the basis of clinical and microbial parameters. the  results indicated that the odds of having a mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm were 5 times greater for smokers than the non-smoker subsample (odds ratio = 5.3; 95%  ci = 2.0 to 13.8). no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any of the bacteria was found between smokers and the non-smoker subsample. based on logistic regression analyses of each of the 5 bacteria and smoking, mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm was significantly associated with the presence of a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and smoking (p < 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == natural distribution of 5 bacteria associated with periodontal disease.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and distribution of 5 bacterial pathogens in subgingival plaque, their relationship with each other and probing depth. plaque was collected from 6905 sites in 938 subjects. a bacterial  concentration fluorescence immunoassay and bacterial specific monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the presence and level of p. gingivalis (pg), a. actinomycetemcomitans (aa), p. intermedia (pi), e. corrodens (ec) and f. nucleatum (fn) in each plaque sample. the prevalence in subjects was lowest for pg (32%) and highest for ec (49%). the site-based frequency distribution of these bacterial species ranged from 10.3% for pg to 18.7% for ec. pi and ec were the bacterial combination most often found together in a subject (27.2%). while 64.0% of the sites were without any of the 5 bacterial species evaluated, 20.2% had only 1 of the 5 bacterial species evaluated. the remaining 15.8% of sites had at  least 2 bacteria species present. there was a general linear association of the detection level of bacterial species and probing depth. the odds ratios were 3.9  (pg), 3.0 (aa), 4.0 (pi), 2.7 (ec) and 2.8 (fn) of finding high levels of these bacterial pathogens at > 5 mm probing depth (p < or = 0.01). mean probing depth at molar sites without a specific bacteria was greater (p < or = 0.01) in subjects with a specific bacterium compared to molar sites in subjects without the bacteria.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

AB  == the complex highly hydrated chemical composition of the bacterial glycocalyx renders it difficult to preserve and visualize at the ultrastructural level. polyanionic stains such as ruthenium red help to maintain some structural integrity, and other more modern approaches include antibody stabilization, lectins, and the addition of lysine to the primary fixative. it has been suggested that the glycocalyx of certain disease-associated organisms may play a  role in the pathogenesis of some microbially based diseases such as periodontitis. new, more adequate, modern methodologies are therefore required for the further study of this structure. in the present study a cold dehydration  process in conjunction with lr white acrylic resin has been employed to study the glycocalyces of three oral gram-negative bacterial species reported to be periodontopathogens. when compared with organisms processed conventionally and with ruthenium red, the organisms processed by the cold dehydration and lr white  method demonstrated a fibrous matrix that was not seen in the other specimens. these results indicate that a combination of reduced dehydration temperature and  cold acrylic resin embedding provides the best methodology for the visualization  of the fine structure of the bacterial glycocalyx. this approach may be particularly useful in the study of organisms within specific disease-associated  environments such as the periodontal pocket.

TI  == gingival fluid il-1 and il-6 levels in refractory periodontitis.
AB  == selected gingival bacteria and cytokine profiles associated with patients who did not respond to conventional periodontal therapy (refractory) were evaluated. 10 subjects with a high incidence of post-active treatment clinical attachment loss  (> 2% sites/year lost > or = 3 mm) were compared to 10 age-, race-, and supragingival plaque-matched patients with low post-treatment clinical attachment loss (< 0.5% sites/year) relative to the following parameters at 2 sites/patient  with the deepest probing depths: (1) presence of 3 selected periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens) in subgingival plaque as determined by selective culturing, and (2) gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) levels of 3 cytokines associated with bone resorption (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6) as determined by two-site elisa. results indicated no significant differences in any clinical measurement (except incidence of clinical attachment loss), in the presence of any bacterial pathogen, or in gcf cytokine levels between refractory subject sites versus stable subject sites. however, when sites producing the greatest total gcf cytokine/patient were compared, sites from refractory patient produced significantly more il-6 (30.1 +/- 4.0 versus 15.4 +/- 2.8 nm, p < 0.01). the subgingival presence of each of the 3 bacterial pathogens was associated with elevated gcf il-1 concentrations. these data suggest that gingival il-1 and il-6  production is different in response to local and systemic factors associated with periodontitis, and that il-6 may play a role in the identification and mechanisms of refractory periodontitis.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == routine anaerobic bacterial culture and systemic antibiotic usage in the treatment of adult periodontitis: a 6-year longitudinal study.
AB  == this investigation evaluated the efficacy of obtaining baseline culture and sensitivity data on a routine basis from the patient with adult periodontitis. patients diagnosed with chronic adult periodontitis, rapidly progressive periodontitis, or refractory periodontitis were followed for up to 6 years. more  than 95% of patients with chronic adult periodontitis were successfully treated with mechanical therapy alone. approximately one half of the patients with rapidly progressive periodontitis were treated successfully without antibiotics.  all of the patients with refractory periodontitis required systemic antibiotics as part of treatment. most patients with chronic adult periodontitis exhibited one or two species of organisms at baseline, and these organisms were eliminated  or reduced to low levels by mechanical therapy. in contrast, patients with rapidly progressive or refractory periodontitis consistently demonstrated multiple species and required systemic antibiotics in conjunction with mechanical therapy to alter the subgingival microbial milieu. routine culturing and antibiotic therapy is contraindicated in patients with chronic adult periodontitis, but may be beneficial for successful treatment of patients with rapidly progressive or refractory periodontitis.

TI  == an in vitro study of polymorphonuclear leucocyte-mediated injury to human gingival keratinocytes by periodontopathic bacterial extracts.
AB  == human gingival keratinocytes were cultured and, after the first passage, subjected to cell detachment assays with polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmns) and/or sonic extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, and eikenella corrodens 1073. the effector-to-target cell ratio was 30:1. bacterial extracts alone caused no disruption of keratinocyte monolayers. pmns alone also caused only minimal detachment after 14 h incubation. adding a. actinomycetemcomitans to the pmn-keratinocyte co-cultures at the concentration of 100 micrograms/ml caused dramatic cell detachment. the effect of a. actinomycetemcomitans was heat labile  and not inhibited by polymyxin b. cell detachment was inhibited by alpha 1-antitrypsin, whereas catalase and superoxide dismutase could not prevent it. no lysis of keratinocytes was observed after incubation, as judged by 51cr release.  e. corrodens had little effect even at the concentration of 1000 micrograms/ml. h2o2 and partially purified pmn elastase also caused detachment of keratinocytes. these data indicate that pmns can cause non-lytic detachment of keratinocytes when interacting with certain bacteria.

TI  == dna probe and enzyme analysis in periodontal diagnostics.
AB  == recent research in periodontology has indicated that a finite number of bacterial species are associated with periodontal disease. this has generated the hypothesis that periodontal disease is essentially an infection due to one or more of the putative periodontopathogens; i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis (sph). this microbial specificity paradigm has already changed the way researchers and some clinicians view periodontal disease. the clinician must heed several cautions signs, however, if he is to use the sph to provide treatment options that could enhance the delivery of care. there are several diagnostic technologies that can be used to detect and semi-quantitate those bacterial species that have been identified as periodontopathogens. this paper discusses diagnostic tests based upon the detection in plaque of dna segments or enzyme activity(ies) that are unique for one or more of the suspected periodontopathogens.

TI  == longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. the antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to actinobacillus sp., p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia in that order. in general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. however, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. in addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. these findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. these included high levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 in ljp and rpp subjects and to  a. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in ljp and gjp subjects.

AB  == gentle extraction of oral bacteria implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal  disease, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, or eikenella corrodens, with saline removes the extracellular components while leaving the bacteria intact. this readily-solubilized surface-associated material (sam) has been demonstrated to significantly inhibit dna and collagen synthesis by murine calvaria at concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml. dna and collagen synthesis in isolated calvarial osteoblasts were also inhibited by these sam preparations with similar dose responses. the inhibitory effect of these bacterial expolymers was blocked by 1 microm indomethacin. the potent inhibitory  actions on bone synthesis of the sam from these bacteria may contribute to the alveolar bone loss found in patients with periodontal disease.

AB  == the easily solubilized surface-associated material from three bacterial species associated with periodontal diseases, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens, produced dose-dependent inhibition of thymidine incorporation by human fibroblasts, the human monocytic cell line u937 and guinea pig epidermal cells. in contrast, lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were either inactive or substantially less active over the dose range tested. one of the constituents of  surface-associated material from a 'non-leucotoxic' strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans was highly cytotoxic to human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells, with 50% killing from less than 1 ng/ml. a constituent of the surface-associated material from p. gingivalis was approximately one log order less active. the lipopolysaccharides from these bacteria were at least three log orders less active in neutrophil killing. these findings add weight to  the hypothesis that easily solubilized exopolymers from periodontopathogens play  a major part in the pathology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == synergistic effect of pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == our previous studies have shown that pyrophosphate (ppi), the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, inhibits the growth of organisms associated with coronal and root surface caries. the purposes of this investigation were to: 1) determine if periodontal pathogens are similarly susceptible to the growth-inhibitory properties of ppi; and 2) determine if combinations of pyrophosphate-sodium dodecyl sulfate (ppi-sds) inhibit growth synergistically. porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus (formerly  wolinella recta) were cultured in appropriate enriched media under anaerobic conditions. inhibition assays were performed in tubes containing media supplemented with ppi and/or sds. a range of concentrations of ppi and sds in 2-fold increments was employed, with each concentration assayed in triplicate. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) analyses revealed all of the bacteria were susceptible to ppi and sds, with mics of 0.67% (25 mm) and 0.01% w/v respectively. combination studies with ppi-sds showed much greater growth inhibition against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans than achieved with  the agents individually. determination of fractional inhibitory concentration indices indicated a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect. under the constraints of the conditions employed, these studies demonstrate the efficacy of ppi-sds combinations in inhibiting the growth of periodontal pathogens. it is conceivable that these compounds may have clinical benefit as a subgingival irrigant.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. adherence of pmns to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. in this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on pmn activation using an in vitro method of measuring pmn adherence to  dacron fibres. most of the bacteria investigated increased pmn adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of pmn lysosomal enzymes and other products. in contrast, bacteroides species suppressed pmns, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. the modulatory effects of oral bacteria on pmn activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.

TI  == fluorescence immunoassay for detecting periodontal bacterial pathogens in plaque.
AB  == a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay has been modified into a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. the bcfia utilizes fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative plaque bacteria. microorganisms closely associated with periodontal disease that can be identified in plaque with the bcfia include porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens. briefly, the procedure involved mixing a patient's plaque sample or other bacterial preparation with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mab in a specialized microtiter plate. this mixture was incubated to allow binding of the mab to its homologous bacteria. the bound and unbound fluorescent tagged mabs were separated by filtration in the modified microtiter plate, and the total bacterial bound fluorescence was determined with  a fluorimeter. the number of a specific bacterial species in a given plaque sample or other bacterial suspension was estimated by reference to a primary standard carried through the bcfia. the lower detection limit of the bcfia was 10(3) to 10(4) bacterial cells from single cultures of bacteria or 10(4) bacterial cells in mixed cultures. the coefficient of variation within and between plates for each of the five bacterium-specific mabs in screening plaque for the periodontal pathogens was less than 10%. these results demonstrate that microbes in plaque can be used as the solid phase in the bcfia to detect and quantitate mabs associated with specific bacteria quickly and reliably.

AB  == recent studies have shown that an atypical gingivitis and a rapidly progressive periodontal disease may be early-occurring opportunistic infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection. this study examined the prevalence of selected periodontal pathogens associated with these hiv-related periodontal lesions. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from both hiv-seronegative and hiv-seropositive homosexual men and from presumably uninfected heterosexual men. dna probes were used to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and wolinella recta in the plaque. the healthy sites in both the seronegative and seropositive homosexual groups showed a greater prevalence of all test bacteria, except for e. corrodens, than did the heterosexual group. hiv-associated periodontitis sites showed a microbial profile qualitatively similar to that of conventional periodontitis, except that b. gingivalis was more prevalent in conventional periodontitis. in contrast, hiv-associated gingivitis sites exhibited a greater prevalence of all bacteria tested than conventional gingivitis sites. in fact, hiv gingivitis generally showed a bacterial profile similar to that of the hiv periodontitis lesions, except that w. recta was significantly more prevalent in hiv periodontitis. these data suggest that the hiv gingivitis lesion is a precursor to hiv periodontitis. thus, early identification and prophylactic treatment of high-risk individuals may prevent the destruction of periodontal tissues.

"non effective site" was defined as little elimination of periodontal pocket. some patients responded remarkably well to root curettage. however the subgingival flora of effective sites, which had been successfully treated and maintained over a period of three weeks, was still significantly different from the subgingival floras of people with healthy gingiva. the predominant cultivable microflora of diseased lesions at the pre-treatment stage, in which a similar proportion of microbiota were detected on both sites in each patient, were significantly increased proportions of bacteroides sp., b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. although b. gingivalis has been implicated as the etiologic agent of  the disease, to which marked antibody response has been found in periodontal pockets, there were decreased proportions of b. intermedius and b. gingivalis after treatment, compared to pre-treatment stage. the results showed that non-effective lesions were associated with subgingival microflora which were populated by higher proportions of b. intermedius and e. corrodens. h. actinomycetemcomitans were detectable during the experimental periods in all sites. it was possible to indicate progressing periodontitis by examining these microflora at the pre-treatment stage. however active or progressing disease in young adults might represent not only an overgrowth of existing organisms but also an abnormality in host resistance.

TI  == microbiology of subgingival plaque from children with localized prepubertal periodontitis.
AB  == localized prepubertal periodontitis has been described as a host-defect mediated  form of bacterially induced periodontitis, with an early onset and rapid progression around a few teeth in children prior to puberty. to further our understanding of the etiology of this disease, we have examined the microbiological components of subgingival dental plaque in 9 children with localized prepubertal periodontitis to determine if patterns of putative pathogens existed, and have compared these results with those obtained from 4 children with no periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples were plated onto a selective medium for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and onto a non-selective medium for anaerobes, and the predominant cultivable microbiota of  2 sites per child was determined. the subgingival microbiota of children with localized prepubertal periodontitis clearly differs from non-diseased children in the detection of high levels of several suspected pathogens, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga sputigena. these putative pathogens were found in various combinations. these findings suggest that localized prepubertal periodontitis is  associated with specific subgingival bacteria which are generally not found in children without periodontitis.

TI  == suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. when this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. samples from  the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. bpb were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total bpb population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). the most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was b. melaninogenicus. expressed as percentages of children in whom bpb were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was b. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other bpb species were present in fewer than 5% of children. fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga  species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.

TI  == human serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms. iv. correlation with homologous infection.
AB  == recent microbiological studies of periodontal disease in humans have supported the concept of a specific bacterial etiology. while individual agents have not been unequivocally identified, numerous gram-negative members of the subgingival  microflora have been implicated. in addition, elevations in systemic antibody responses have been consistent with certain oral microorganisms being involved in an infectious process associated with the disease. this report delineates the relationship between elevated systemic antibody levels and oral colonization with the homologous microorganism at active disease sites. thirty-four patients with various types of periodontal disease were examined. using elisa, each patient was shown to have an elevated antibody response to at least one organism from a battery of 18 oral microorganisms that were tested. subsequently, subgingival plaque was cultured from disease-active and -inactive sites of each subject. the  results demonstrated that the same microorganism to which the individual exhibited elevated serum antibody responses was detected in nearly 55% of the disease-active sites, while only 18% of the inactive sites showed the microorganism. certain microorganisms including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, eikenella corrodens and wolinella  recta were primarily or exclusively correlated with active disease lesions. these findings support the hypothesis that elevated systemic antibodies to periodontopathic bacteria are reflective of subgingival colonization and exist as a response to a bacterial infection at disease-active sites.
