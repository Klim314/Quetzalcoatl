TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.
