TI  == the sactibiotic subclass of bacteriocins: an update.
AB  == the sactibiotics are a recently designated subclass of bacteriocins that contain  characteristic cysteine thiol to alpha-carbon linkages as post-translational modification. they are a relatively small subclass of bacteriocins compared to the most thoroughly studied lantibiotics. the sactibiotics that have been extensively studied thus far are thuricin cd, subtilosin a, thurincin h, and propionicin f. despite their recent discovery, there have already been significant advances made in the study of sactibiotics, most notably the discovery of the narrow spectrum anti-clostridium difficile sactibiotic, thuricin cd. in addition, scientists have gained insights into the mechanisms of action of the sactibiotic subtilosin a, which targets listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, and other pathogens. also, the development of heterologous host systems and homologous expression and site-directed mutagenesis systems for the sactibiotic thurincin h have opened up many opportunities for further studies on  this sactibiotic. these and other recent studies concerning the molecular biology, 3d structural elucidation, mode of action, self-protection mechanisms, and antimicrobial spectrum of the sactibiotic subgroup of bacteriocins are discussed in this review.

TI  == metronidazole. a therapeutic review and update.
AB  == the nitroimidazole antibiotic metronidazole has a limited spectrum of activity that encompasses various protozoans and most gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. metronidazole has activity against protozoans like entamoeba  histolytica, giardia lamblia and trichomonas vaginalis, for which the drug was first approved as an effective treatment. anaerobic bacteria which are typically  sensitive are primarily gram-negative anaerobes belonging to the bacteroides and  fusobacterium spp. gram-positive anaerobes such as peptostreptococci and clostridia spp. are likely to test sensitive to metronidazole, but resistant isolates are probably encountered with greater frequency than with the gram-negative anaerobes. gardnerella vaginalis is a pleomorphic gram-variable bacterial bacillus that is also susceptible to metronidazole. helicobacter pylori has been strongly associated with gastritis and duodenal ulcers. classic regimens for eradicating this pathogen have included metronidazole, usually with acid suppression medication plus bismuth and amoxicillin. the activity of metronidazole against anaerobic bowel flora has been used for prophylaxis and treatment of patients with crohn's disease who might develop an infectious complication. treatment of clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembraneous colitis has usually been with oral metronidazole or vancomycin, but the lower cost and similar efficacy of metronidazole, coupled with the increased concern about imprudent use of vancomycin leading to increased resistance in enterococci, have made metronidazole the preferred agent here. metronidazole has played an important role in anaerobic-related infections. advantages to using metronidazole are the percentage of sensitive gram-negative anaerobes, its availability as oral and intravenous dosage forms, its rapid bacterial killing, its good tissue penetration, its considerably lower chance of inducing c. difficile colitis, and  expense. metronidazole has notable effectiveness in treating anaerobic brain abscesses. metronidazole is a cost-effective agent due to its low acquisition cost, its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, an acceptable adverse effect profile, and its undiminished antimicrobial activity. while its role as part of a therapeutic regimen for treating mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections has been reduced by newer, more expensive combination therapies, these new combinations have not been shown to have any therapeutic advantage over metronidazole. although the use of metronidazole on a global scale has been curtailed by newer agents for various infections, metronidazole still has a role for these and other therapeutic uses. many clinicians still consider metronidazole to be the 'gold standard' antibiotic against which all other antibiotics with anaerobic activity  should be compared.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of pd127,391, a new quinolone.
AB  == mics of pd127,391 a new 4-quinolone, and of ci934 and ciprofloxacin, two previously reported 4-quinolones, were determined for common clinical bacterial isolates by an agar-dilution method. pd127,391 was the most active drug against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter spp (mics less than 0.12 mg/l) and as active as ciprofloxacin against aeromonas spp. (mics less than 0.008 mg/l) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics less than 1 mg/l). it was more active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas spp. including ps. maltophilia (mics less than  0.25 mg/l). all three drugs had high activity, with pd129,391 again the best, against haemophilus influenzae brahmamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. pd127,391 was much more active than the other drugs against campylobacter coli/jejuni (pd127,391 mics less than 0.03 mg/l) and gardnerella vaginalis (pd127,391 mics less than 0.25 mg/l). pd127,391 inhibited all staphylococci at less than 0.06 mg/l and streptococci at less than 0.5 mg/l, thus being more active than ci934 or ciprofloxacin. pd127,391 was much more active against anaerobic cocci, bacteroides spp. and clostridia (including clostridium difficile) (mics less than 1 mg/l) than was ci934 (mics less than 16 mg/l) or ciprofloxacin (mics less than 64 mg/l). no bacterium that we examined required more than 1 mg/l of pd127,391 for inhibition, and there was no cross resistance with unrelated antibiotics.
