TI  == the neonatal gut harbours distinct bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == background: recent studies have described the bifidobacterial composition of neonates at a species level; however, with advancing technologies we can gain insight into the diversity of the bifidobacterial microbiota residing within the  infant gut. objective: to compare species and strain diversity of culturable bifidobacterial populations in faecal samples obtained from healthy term infants  on three different feeding regimes. study design: in total, 51 healthy term infants were recruited for this study and divided equally into three different groups (n=17) based on their feeding regime during the first 4 weeks of life. culturable bifidobacterial populations were analysed at week 1, week 4 and 6 months of age. isolates were characterised to species level by 16s rrna-internally transcribed spacer (its) gene sequence analysis and to strain level by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: in total,173 bifidobacterial strains were detected across all three groups from 2295 isolates, 42% (72 of 173) of which were detected in the prebiotic-fed group, followed by 30% (52 of 173) and 28% (49 of 173) in the breastfed and non-prebiotic-fed groups, respectively. surprisingly, only two of the 51 infants harboured an identical bifidobacterial strain which was not present in the other 49 infants. prebiotic supplementation in the early neonatal period increased the prevalence of bifidobacterium longum in infants, in addition to promoting strain diversity.  b. longum was the dominant species recovered from all three groups during the first 6 months of life, followed by bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium bifidum. conclusions: this study reveals a hitherto unknown level of diversity at the strain level among bifidobacteria isolated from different infants and the influence prebiotic formula feeding has on the bifidobacterial population.

TI  == a novel lactobacillus casei lp1 producing 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, a bifidogenic growth stimulator.
AB  == 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (dhna) is a bifidogenic growth stimulator (bgs) and could be a functional food ingredient since bifidobacteria are beneficial for human health. for that reason, lactic acid bacteria producing dhna have been screened. a lactic acid bacterium lp1 strain isolated from a natural cheese was confirmed to produce dhna, analyzed by a hplc method. the strain was identified as lactobacillus casei by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. the cell-free supernatant of fermented whey produced by l. casei lp1 presented the bgs activity for three bifidobacterial strains such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis  kctc 3127, bifidobacterium bifidum kctc 3202, and bifidobacterium breve kctc 3220 which were human-originated. to the best of our knowledge, a l. casei strain which can produce dhna was firstly identified in this study.

TI  == multilocus sequence typing of bifidobacterial strains from infant's faeces and human milk: are bifidobacteria being sustainably shared during breastfeeding?
AB  == bifidobacteria are considered to be one of the most important beneficial intestinal bacteria for infants, contributing to the priming of the mucosal immune system. these microbes can also be detected in mother's milk, suggesting a potential role of human milk in the colonisation of infant's gut. however, little is known about the timing of bacteria appearance in human milk, and whether human milk is the first source of inoculation. here, we investigated whether specific strains are shared sustainably between maternal milk and infant's gut. faecal samples and human milk were collected from 102 healthy mother-infant pairs (infant's faeces: meconium, 7, 30 days of age; mother's milk: once before delivery, colostrum, 7, 30 days after delivery). bifidobacterial strains were isolated from these samples, and were discriminated by means of multilocus sequencing typing. no bifidobacteria were detected from human milk collected before delivery, or colostrum. strains were isolated only from human milk samples obtained 7 days after birth or later. on the other hand, bifidobacterial strains  were obtained from infant's faeces throughout the study period, sometimes as early as the first day of life (meconium). we have found that bifidobacterial species belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum could be identified as monophyletic between  infant's faeces and their mother's milk. these strains were confirmed to be sustainably shared between maternal milk and infant's gut. moreover, monophyletic strains were isolated at the same time point or earlier from infant's faeces than from human milk, and none were isolated earlier from human milk than from infant's faeces. although it remains unclear whether human milk is the first source of microbes for infants, our results confirm that human milk is a reservoir of bifidobacteria, and specific strains are shared between infant's intestine and human milk during breastfeeding.

TI  == cross-feeding by bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 during co-cultivation with bifidobacterium bifidum prl2010 in a mucin-based medium.
AB  == background: bifidobacteria constitute a specific group of commensal bacteria that commonly inhabit the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 was previously shown to utilize a variety of plant/diet/host-derived carbohydrates, including cellodextrin, starch and galactan, as well as the mucin  and hmo-derived monosaccharide, sialic acid. in the current study, we investigated the ability of this strain to utilize parts of a host-derived source of carbohydrate, namely the mucin glycoprotein, when grown in co-culture with the mucin-degrading bifidobacterium bifidum prl2010. results: b. breve ucc2003 was shown to exhibit growth properties in a mucin-based medium, but only when grown in the presence of b. bifidum prl2010, which is known to metabolize mucin. a combination of hpaec-pad and transcriptome analyses identified some of the possible monosaccharides and oligosaccharides which support this enhanced co-cultivation growth/viability phenotype. conclusion: this study describes the potential existence of a gut commensal relationship between two bifidobacterial species. we demonstrate the in vitro ability of b. breve ucc2003 to cross-feed on sugars released by the mucin-degrading activity of b. bifidum prl2010, thus advancing our knowledge on the metabolic adaptability which allows the former strain to colonize the (infant) gut by its extensive metabolic abilities to (co-)utilize available carbohydrate sources.

TI  == mupirocin-mucin agar for selective enumeration of bifidobacterium bifidum.
AB  == bifidobacterium bifidum is a bacterial species exclusively found in the human intestinal tract. this species is becoming increasingly popular as a probiotic organism added to lyophilized products. in this study, porcine mucin was used as  the sole carbon source for the selective enumeration of b. bifidum in probiotic food additives. thirty-six bifidobacterial strains were cultivated in broth with  mucin. only 13 strains of b. bifidum utilized the mucin to produce acids. b. bifidum was selectively enumerated in eight probiotic food supplements using agar (mm agar) containing mupirocin (100 mg/l) and mucin (20 g/l) as the sole carbon source. mm agar was fully selective if the b. bifidum species was presented together with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, bifidobacterium breve, and  bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum species and with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli, streptococci). isolated strains of b. bifidum were identified using biochemical, pcr, maldi-tof procedures and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the novel selective medium was also suitable for the isolation of b. bifidum strains  from human fecal samples.

TI  == probiotic bifidobacterium species stimulate human slc26a3 gene function and expression in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == slc26a3, or downregulated in adenoma (dra), plays a major role in mediating cl(-) absorption in the mammalian intestine. disturbances in dra function and expression have been implicated in intestinal disorders such as congenital cl(-)  diarrhea and gut inflammation. we previously showed that an increase in dra function and expression by lactobacillus acidophilus and its culture supernatant  (cs) might underlie antidiarrheal effects of this probiotic strain. however, the  effects of bifidobacterium species, important inhabitants of the human colon, on  intestinal cl(-)/hco3 (-) exchange activity are not known. our current results demonstrate that cs derived from bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium bifidum increased anion exchange activity in caco-2 cells ( approximately 1.8- to 2.4-fold). consistent with the increase in dra function, cs also increased the protein, as well as the mrna, level of dra (but not putative anion transporter 1). cs of all three bifidobacterium sp. increased dra promoter  activity (-1,183/+114 bp) in caco-2 cells (1.5- to 1.8-fold). furthermore, the increase in dra mrna expression by cs of b. breve and b. infantis was blocked in  the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin d (5 mum) and the erk1/2  mapk pathway inhibitor u0126 (10 mum). administration of live b. breve, b. infantis, and b. bifidum by oral gavage to mice for 24 h increased dra mrna and protein levels in the colon. these data demonstrate an upregulation of dra via activation of the erk1/2 pathway that may underlie potential antidiarrheal effects of bifidobacterium sp.

TI  == metabolism of sialic acid by bifidobacterium breve ucc2003.
AB  == bifidobacteria constitute a specific group of commensal bacteria that inhabit the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other mammals. bifidobacterium breve ucc2003 has previously been shown to utilize several plant-derived carbohydrates  that include cellodextrins, starch, and galactan. in the present study, we investigated the ability of this strain to utilize the mucin- and human milk oligosaccharide (hmo)-derived carbohydrate sialic acid. using a combination of transcriptomic and functional genomic approaches, we identified a gene cluster dedicated to the uptake and metabolism of sialic acid. furthermore, we demonstrate that b. breve ucc2003 can cross feed on sialic acid derived from the  metabolism of 3'-sialyllactose, an abundant hmo, by another infant gut bifidobacterial strain, bifidobacterium bifidum prl2010.

TI  == lactoferrin and bifidobacteria.
AB  == we herein summarized the effects of lactoferrin (lf) on bifidobacteria. many in vitro studies previously reported the growth-promoting (bifidogenic) effects of lf on bifidobacteria. the involvement of bound iron, sugar chains, and lf peptides has been proposed in this bifidogenic mechanism. peptides in the lf pepsin hydrolysate (lfh) showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural lf; therefore, we speculated that peptides may be the bifidogenic active principle of lf. lf or its peptides may be recognized by lf-binding proteins on the surface of bifidobacterial cells, and the cationic nature or disulfide bonds of lf or its peptides may play a crucial role in its recognition by these proteins. of the bifidobacterial species so far identified, human lf and peptides in human lfh were more likely to show bifidogenic activity especially to bifidobacterium bifidum, and bovine lf (blf) and peptides in bovine lfh (blfh) to b. breve and b. infantis. in animal studies, the administration of lf to mice or piglets increased bifidobacteria levels in the intestine. in human trials, the administration of lf-containing formula to infants increased bifidobacteria levels in the feces; however, human milk achieved better results than lf-containing formula. in the case of breast-fed infants, lf may show bifidogenic activity synergistically with other milk components such as human milk oligosaccharides. as blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural blf,  especially to b. breve and b. infantis in vitro, and these species are known to be infant-specific species, blfh may be a beneficial ingredient in formula.

TI  == influence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group b streptococcus on  the early newborn gut composition and evaluation of the anti-streptococcus activity of bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == several factors are known to influence the early colonization of the gut in newborns. among them, the use of antibiotics on the mother during labor, referred to as intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (iap), has scarcely been investigated, although this practice is routinely used in group b streptococcus (gbs)-positive  women. this work is therefore aimed at verifying whether iap can influence the main microbial groups of the newborn gut microbiota at an early stage of microbial establishment. fifty-two newborns were recruited: 26 born by mothers negative to gbs (control group) and 26 by mothers positive to gbs and subjected to iap with ampicillin (iap group). selected microbial groups (lactobacillus spp., bidobacterium spp., bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli) were quantified with real-time pcr on dna extracted from newborn feces. further analysis was performed within the bidobacterium genus by using dgge after amplification with genus-specific primers. results obtained showed a significant decrease of the bifidobacteria counts after antibiotic treatment of the mother. bifidobacteria were found to be affected by iap not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. in fact, iap determined a decrement in the frequency of bidobacterium breve, bidobacterium bifidum, and bidobacterium dentium with respect to the control group. moreover, this study has preliminarily evaluated that some bifidobacterial strains, previously selected for use in infants, have antibacterial properties against gbs and are therefore potential candidates for being applied as probiotics for the prevention of gbs infections.

TI  == cohort study of probiotics in a north american neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine whether routine probiotic administration to very preterm  infants would reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) without adverse consequences. study design: since the end of july 2011, we have administered a probiotic mixture to all admitted infants of <32 weeks' gestation. we give 0.5 g of a mixture of 4 bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium breve, bifidum, infantis, and longum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus ha-111 [corrected] (2 x 10(9) colony-forming units) per day, starting with the first feed, until the infant reaches 34 weeks. we compared complications among infants admitted during the first 17 months of routine use with those admitted during the previous 17 months. results: two hundred ninety-four infants received probiotics, and 317 infants formed the comparison group. introduction of probiotics was associated with a reduction in nec (from 9.8% to 5.4%, p < .02), a nonsignificant decrease in death (9.8% to 6.8%), and a significant reduction in the combined outcome of death or nec (from 17% to 10.5%, p < .05). after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, and sex, the improvements remained significant (or for nec, 0.51; 95% ci, 0.26-0.98; or for death or nec, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.33-0.93). there was no effect of probiotics on health care-associated infection. discussion: a product that is readily available in north america, that has excellent quality control, and that contains strains similar to those that have been shown effective in randomized controlled trials substantially reduced the frequency of nec in our neonatal intensive care unit.

TI  == variation in consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by infant gut-associated  strains of bifidobacterium breve.
AB  == human milk contains a high concentration of complex oligosaccharides that influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota in breast-fed infants. previous studies have indicated that select species such as bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and bifidobacterium bifidum can utilize human milk oligosaccharides (hmo) in vitro as the sole carbon source, while the relatively few b. longum subsp. longum and bifidobacterium breve isolates tested appear less adapted to these substrates. considering the high frequency at which b. breve is  isolated from breast-fed infant feces, we postulated that some b. breve strains can more vigorously consume hmo and thus are enriched in the breast-fed infant gastrointestinal tract. to examine this, a number of b. breve isolates from breast-fed infant feces were characterized for the presence of different glycosyl hydrolases that participate in hmo utilization, as well as by their ability to grow on hmo or specific hmo species such as lacto-n-tetraose (lnt) and fucosyllactose. all b. breve strains showed high levels of growth on lnt and lacto-n-neotetraose (lnnt), and, in general, growth on total hmo was moderate for most of the strains, with several strain differences. growth and consumption of fucosylated hmo were strain dependent, mostly in isolates possessing a glycosyl hydrolase family 29 alpha-fucosidase. glycoprofiling of the spent supernatant after hmo fermentation by select strains revealed that all b. breve strains can utilize sialylated hmo to a certain extent, especially sialyl-lacto-n-tetraose. interestingly, this specific oligosaccharide was depleted before neutral lnt by strain sc95. in aggregate, this work indicates that the hmo consumption phenotype in b. breve is variable; however, some strains display specific adaptations to these substrates, enabling more vigorous consumption of fucosylated and sialylated hmo. these results provide a rationale for the predominance of this species in breast-fed infant feces and contribute to a more accurate picture of the ecology of the developing infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == differential modulation of human intestinal bifidobacterium populations after consumption of a wild blueberry (vaccinium angustifolium) drink.
AB  == bifidobacteria are gaining increasing interest as health-promoting bacteria. nonetheless, the genus comprises several species, which can exert different effects on human host. previous studies showed that wild blueberry drink consumption could selectively increase intestinal bifidobacteria, suggesting an important role for the polyphenols and fiber present in wild blueberries. this study evaluated the modulation of the most common and abundant bifidobacterial taxonomic groups inhabiting the human gut in the same fecal samples. the analyses carried out showed that b. adolescentis, b. breve, b. catenulatum/pseudocatelulatum, and b. longum subsp. longum were always present in the group of subjects enrolled, whereas b. bifidum and b. longum subsp. infantis  were not. furthermore, it was found that the most predominant bifidobacterial species were b. longum subsp. longum and b. adolescentis. the results obtained revealed a high interindividual variability; however, a significant increase of b. longum subsp. infantis cell concentration was observed in the feces of volunteers after the wild blueberry drink treatment. this bifidobacterial group was shown to possess immunomodulatory abilities and to relieve symptoms and promote the regression of several gastrointestinal disorders. thus, an increased  cell concentration of b. longum subsp. infantis in the human gut could be considered of potential health benefit. in conclusion, wild blueberry consumption resulted in a specific bifidogenic effect that could positively affect certain populations of bifidobacteria with demonstrated health-promoting properties.

TI  == cholesterol-lowering probiotics: in vitro selection and in vivo testing of bifidobacteria.
AB  == thirty-four strains of bifidobacteria belonging to bifidobacterium adolescentis,  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseu-docatenulatum were assayed in vitro for the ability to assimilate cholesterol and for bile salt hydrolase (bsh) against glycocholic and taurodeoxycholic acids (gca and tdca). cholesterol assimilation was peculiar characteristic of two strains belonging to the species  b. bifidum (b. bifidum mb 107 and b. bifidum mb 109), which removed 81 and 50 mg  of cholesterol per gram of biomass, being the median of specific cholesterol absorption by bifidobacteria 19 mg/g. significant differences in bsh activities were not established among bifidobacterial species. however, the screening resulted in the selection of promising strains able to efficiently deconjugate gca and tdca. no relationship was recognized between bsh phenotype and the extent of cholesterol assimilation. on the basis of cholesterol assimilation or bshgca and bshtdca activities, b. bifidum mb 109 (dsmz 23731), b. breve mb 113 (dsmz 23732), and b. animalis subsp. lactis mb 2409 (dsmz 23733) were combined in a probiotic mixture to be fed to hypercholesterolemic rats. the administration of this probiotic formulation resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol and low-density cholesterol (ldl-c), whereas it did not affect high-density cholesterol (hdl-c) and hdl-c/ldl-c ratio.

TI  == tolerance of bifidobacterium human isolates to bile, acid and oxygen.
AB  == bifidobacteria are part of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and are used as  probiotics in functional food products because of their health promoting properties. however, only few data are available on the phenotypic characteristics displayed by human bifidobacteria strain populations. in this study we compared the in vitro tolerance to acid, bile and oxygen of the largest  number of independent human intestinal strains. bile and acid tolerance varied among species and independent strains within a species: b. adolescentis strains were the most tolerant to bile followed by bifidobacterium longum and b. breve; b. longum, b. breve and b. dentium showed the highest viability levels after exposure to acid ph. oxygen tolerance was largely distributed among intestinal bifidobacteria: b. longum, b. breve and b. bifidum showed the highest oxygen tolerance. b. adolescentis showed the highest susceptibility to acid and oxygen stresses. the present study gave us the opportunity to update our knowledge about the phenotypic characteristics of human intestinal bifidobacteria. b. longum and  b. breve harboured the best tolerance to oxygen, bile and acid stresses. based on such biological characters, b. longum and b. breve species showed the highest interest in terms of potential selection of human probiotics.

TI  == efficacy of different probiotic combinations on death and necrotizing enterocolitis in a premature rat model.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to investigate the most effective probiotic combinations to prevent death and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in a  premature rat model. methods: one hundred fifty-eight premature sprague-dawley premature rats were enrolled. probiotic strains bifidobacterium bifidum, b longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l plantarum, and b breve were fed as a single  strain or mixture with 2 or 3 strains for a total of 9 study groups; control groups received no exogenous probiotic supplement. fecal samples were collected for 72 hours to detect probiotic strains and pathologic strains by real-time polymerase chain reaction. colony counts of probiotic strains escherichia coli and klebsiella were compared between groups before and after 36 hours of the study period. the incidence of death and nec were compared via fisher exact test  between groups. results: the results demonstrated that l plantarum alone (p = 0.0026) and b bifidum with b longum together (p = 0.0017) were more effective in  reducing nec as compared with the control group. all of the study groups except b breve and b bifidum with b breve definitely prevented death compared with controls. b bifidum and b longum together had significantly lower mortality than  the control group (p < 0.0001). colony counts of e coli and klebsiella in stool samples were significantly decreased in the b bifidum, b longum, and l plantarum  group compared with the other study and control groups after 36 hours. conclusions: administration of a mixture of probiotic strains with b bifidum and  b longum was most effective in preventing death and nec in this animal model, and these observations provide an evidence-based strategy for designing further neonatal clinical trials.

TI  == comparison of the compositions of the stool microbiotas of infants fed goat milk  formula, cow milk-based formula, or breast milk.
AB  == the aim of the study was to compare the compositions of the fecal microbiotas of  infants fed goat milk formula to those of infants fed cow milk formula or breast  milk as the gold standard. pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene sequences was used in  the analysis of the microbiotas in stool samples collected from 90 australian babies (30 in each group) at 2 months of age. beta-diversity analysis of total microbiota sequences and lachnospiraceae sequences revealed that they were more similar in breast milk/goat milk comparisons than in breast milk/cow milk comparisons. the lachnospiraceae were mostly restricted to a single species (ruminococcus gnavus) in breast milk-fed and goat milk-fed babies compared to a more diverse collection in cow milk-fed babies. bifidobacteriaceae were abundant  in the microbiotas of infants in all three groups. bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum were the most commonly detected bifidobacterial species. a semiquantitative pcr method was devised to differentiate between b. longum subsp. longum and b. longum subsp. infantis and was used to test stool samples. b. longum subsp. infantis was seldom present in stools, even of breast milk-fed babies. the presence of b. bifidum in the stools  of breast milk-fed infants at abundances greater than 10% of the total microbiota was associated with the highest total abundances of bifidobacteriaceae. when bifidobacteriaceae abundance was low, lachnospiraceae abundances were greater. new information about the composition of the fecal microbiota when goat milk formula is used in infant nutrition was thus obtained.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bifidobacterium strains of human origin for potential use  in probiotic functional foods.
AB  == the present study investigated some in vitro properties for probiotic use of four strains of bifidobacteria isolated from faeces of healthy children (bifidobacterium longum 51a, bifidobacterium breve 1101a, bifidobacterium pseudolongum 1191a and bifidobacterium bifidum 1622a). in vitro tests were carried out to compare growth rate, aerotolerance, antagonistic activity against  pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and cell wall hydrophobicity. mean doubling time of b. longum 51a was shorter compared to the other strains. all strains were aerotolerant up to 72 h of exposure to oxygen. in vitro antagonism showed that b. longum 51a and b. pseudolongum 1191a were able to produce inhibitory diffusible compounds against all pathogenic bacteria tested, but not against candida albicans. b. longum 51a was sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested, except neomycin. the hydrophobic property of the cell wall was highest for b. bifidum 1622a. based on these parameters, b. longum 51a showed the best potential for probiotic use among the tested strains, presenting the greatest sensitivity to antimicrobials, the best growth rate and the highest capacity to produce antagonistic substances against various pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == assessment of intestinal microbiota modulation ability of bifidobacterium strains in in vitro fecal batch cultures from preterm neonates.
AB  == microbial colonization of the infant gut is essential for the development of the  intestine and the immune system. the intestinal microbiota of full-term breast-fed infants is considered as the health standard for newborns. a culture medium containing formula milk was designed, which allowed a balanced growth of intestinal microorganisms and was used to perform fecal batch cultures from preterm babies. sixteen bifidobacterium strains and fructooligosaccharides (fos)  were tested for their ability to modulate in vitro the intestinal microbiota. the production of short chain fatty acids (scfa) was measured by gas chromatography and the levels of some anaerobe (bifidobacterium and bacteroides groups) and facultative anaerobes (enterobacteriaceae, enterococcaceae, weissella group, and  klebsiella pneumoniae) were determined by quantitative pcr. results were referred to a fecal negative control culture without microorganisms or fos added. strains  that in fecal cultures counteracted better the aberrancies previously found in feces of preterm babies, as compared with full-term breast-fed infants, were selected. the three bifidobacterium bifidum strains tested in this work promoted  the most suitable shifts in scfa and in the ratio of variables facultative anaerobes to anaerobes. two bifidobacterium breve strains complied with the requirement for facultative anaerobes and anaerobes and one of them also promoted a suitable shift of scfa. bifidobacteria behaved similarly as fos regarding the microbial profiles in fecal cultures but the production of lactic and acetic acid was much lower. b. breve and b. bifidum strains selected represent promising candidates for their assessment in more complex in vitro and in vivo models.

TI  == bifidobacterial succession and correlation networks in a large unselected cohort  of mothers and their children.
AB  == bifidobacteria are a major microbial component of infant gut microbiota, which is believed to promote health benefits for the host and stimulate maturation of the  immune system. despite their perceived importance, very little is known about the natural development of and possible correlations between bifidobacteria in human  populations. to address this knowledge gap, we analyzed stool samples from a randomly selected healthy cohort of 87 infants and their mothers with >90% of vaginal delivery and nearly 100% breast-feeding at 4 months. fecal material was sampled during pregnancy, at 3 and 10 days, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years after birth. stool samples were predicted to be rich in the species bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, b. breve, and b. longum. due to high variation, we did not identify a clear age-related structure at the individual level. within the population as a whole, however, there were clear age-related successions. negative correlations between the b. longum group and b. adolescentis were detected in adults and in 1- and 2-year-old children, whereas negative correlations between b. longum and b. breve were characteristic for newborns and 4-month-old infants. the highly structured age-related development of and correlation networks between bifidobacterial species during the first 2 years of life mirrors their different or competing nutritional requirements, which in turn may be associated with specific biological functions in the development of healthy gut.

TI  == molecular monitoring of the development of intestinal microbiota in japanese infants.
AB  == the faecal microbiota of 166 healthy japanese newborns was analysed periodically  from day 1 after birth until the age of 3 years by using the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr. faecal ph and the organic acid concentration were also examined. colonisation by both facultative anaerobes and strict anaerobes was confirmed in 95% of the meconium tested. bifidobacterium-predominant microbiota was established subsequently in most of the infants by 3 months after  birth. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium catenulatum group and bifidobacterium bifidum were the species mainly detected. intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the bifidobacterial population levels, but not other strict anaerobe groups, were found to be negatively correlated with those of the enterobacteriaceae from 7 days until 3 months after birth. faecal ph was maintained at about 6 until 6 months after birth and reached 6.6 at 3 years after birth. the initial concentration of faecal organic acids (19 mum/g of faeces) just after birth increased until 3 years after birth to the level of 111 mum/g of faeces. early start of feeding formula milk promoted colonisation by obligate anaerobes such as the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, prevotella, and atopobium cluster during the 3 months after birth. population levels of the bifidobacteria until 1 month after birth and those of the bacteroides fragilis group until 6 months after birth were lower in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered normally. the results suggested that both earlier start of feeding of formula milk and the mode of infant delivery were found to be important in the development of intestinal microbiota in early infancy.

TI  == inter-species differences in the growth of bifidobacteria cultured on human milk  oligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk (hm) contains as the third most abundant component around 200 different structures of human milk oligosaccharides (hmos). hmos are the first and irreplaceable prebiotics for infants, supporting bifidobacteria as the most important bacterial group in an infant intestine. the aim of our study was to test the growth of bifidobacteria in hm and on hmos. bifidobacteria were isolated from two groups of infants. the first one (eight strains) were isolated from infants who had bifidobacteria in their feces but, after a short period of time (4 to 24 days), bifidobacteria were no longer detected in their feces (disappeared bifidobacteria [db]). the second group of bifidobacteria (eight strains) originated from infants with continual presence of bifidobacteria in their feces (persistent bifidobacteria [pb]). there were significant differences  (p < 0.05) between db and pb groups in the ability of the strains to grow in hm.  pb grew in hm, reaching counts higher than 7 log cfu/ml. in contrast, counts of db decreased from 5 to 4.3 log cfu/ml after cultivation in hm. the final ph after cultivation of bifidobacteria on hmos was 6.2 and 4.9 in dp and pb groups, respectively. in general, bifidobacterium bifidum and b. breve species were able  to utilize hmos, while b. adolescentis and b. longum subsp. longum species did not. the ability to grow in hm and to utilize hmos seem to be important properties of bifidobacteria which are able to colonize infant intestinal tract.

TI  == conjugated linoleic and linolenic acid production kinetics by bifidobacteria differ among strains.
AB  == there is great interest in conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and conjugated linolenic acid (clna) isomers because of their supposed health-promoting properties. therefore, the differences in production kinetics of cla and clna isomers from linoleic acid (la) and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-lna), respectively, by bifidobacteria were investigated. laboratory fermentations, supplemented with la or alpha-lna in the fermentation medium, were performed with bifidobacterium bifidum lmg 10645, bifidobacterium breve lmg 11040, b. breve lmg  11084, b. breve lmg 11613, b. breve lmg 13194, and bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. pseudolongum lmg 11595. conversion of la and alpha-lna to cla and clna isomers, respectively, started immediately upon addition of the substrate fatty acids. during the active growth phase, the c9, t11-cla isomer and the putative c9, t11, c15-clna isomer were formed. further fermentation resulted in a reduction in the concentration of c9, t11-cla and c9, t11, c15-clna and the subsequent production of the t9, t11-cla isomer and the putative t9, t11, c15-clna isomer, respectively. modelling of the growth and metabolite data indicated differences in production kinetics among the strains. some strains displayed a high specific conversion of la and alpha-lna despite poor growth, whereas other strains grew well but displayed lower conversion. production of specific cla and clna isomers by bifidobacteria holds potential for the production of functional foods and could contribute to their probiotic properties.

TI  == interaction of bifidobacterium bifidum lmg13195 with ht29 cells influences regulatory-t-cell-associated chemokine receptor expression.
AB  == probiotics play an important role in the maintenance of the gastrointestinal barrier. in addition to direct effects on mucosal integrity, the interaction with the intestinal mucosa may have an active immunoregulatory effect. in the present  work, we exposed ht29 intestinal epithelial cells to two bifidobacterium species  to determine their effect on gene expression profile, enterocyte monolayer integrity, and t-cell response. bifidobacterium breve ipla 20004 triggered a more pronounced increase in the transepithelial resistance of the enterocyte monolayer than bifidobacterium bifidum lmg13195. the transcriptome profile of ht29 cells cultured in the presence of b. bifidum lmg13195 showed an increased expression of immune mediators and, interestingly, chemotactic molecules (cxcl10, ccl20, cxcl11 and ccl22) able to recruit lymphocytes. since regulatory t cells (treg cells) may express receptors for specific chemokines, we cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells with supernatants of ht29 cells previously treated with bifidobacterium strains and analyzed foxp3 and cd25 treg markers and ccr6, cxcr3, ccr4, and ccr3 expression on cd4(+) lymphocytes. the proportion of cd25(high) foxp3(+) cells was significantly increased after culture with b. bifidum lmg13195-conditioned ht29 supernatant. moreover, this treatment led to the largest amount of ccr6(+) cxcr3(-) ccr4(+) ccr3(+) cd4(+) cells expressing high levels of cd25, corresponding to the treg population. these results suggest that  soluble factors secreted after b. bifidum lmg13195 contact with intestinal epithelial cells favored the generation of cd4(+) cd25(high) lymphocytes expressing chemokine receptor treg markers, thus making possible their recruitment to the intestinal mucosa.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == immune response to bifidobacterium bifidum strains support treg/th17 plasticity.
AB  == in this work we analyzed the immune activation properties of different bifidobacterium strains in order to establish their ability as inductors of specific effector (th) or regulatory (treg) responses. first, we determined the cytokine pattern induced by 21 bifidobacterium strains in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). results showed that four bifidobacterium bifidum strains showed the highest production of il-17 as well as a poor secretion of ifngamma and tnfalpha, suggesting a th17 profile whereas other bifidobacterium strains exhibited a th1-suggestive profile. given the key role of th17 subsets in mucosal defence, strains suggestive of th17 responses and the putative th1 bifidobacterium breve bm12/11 were selected to stimulate dendritic cells (dc) to  further determine their capability to induce the differentiation of naive cd4(+)  lymphocytes toward different th or treg cells. all selected strains were able to  induce phenotypic dc maturation, but showed differences in cytokine stimulation,  dc treated with the putative th17 strains displaying high il-1beta/il-12 and low  il-12/il-10 index, whereas bm12/11-dc exhibited the highest il-12/il-10 ratio. differentiation of naive lymphocytes confirmed th1 polarization by bm12/11. unexpectedly, any b. bifidum strain showed significant capability for th17 generation, and they were able to generate functional treg, thus suggesting differences between in vivo and vitro responses. in fact, activation of memory lymphocytes present in pbmcs with these bacteria, point out the presence in vivo  of specific th17 cells, supporting the plasticity of treg/th17 populations and the key role of commensal bacteria in mucosal tolerance and t cell reprogramming  when needed.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == physiology of consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by infant gut-associated bifidobacteria.
AB  == the bifidogenic effect of human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) has long been known, yet the precise mechanism underlying it remains unresolved. recent studies show that some species/subspecies of bifidobacterium are equipped with genetic and enzymatic sets dedicated to the utilization of hmos, and consequently they can grow on hmos; however, the ability to metabolize hmos has not been directly linked to the actual metabolic behavior of the bacteria. in this report, we clarify the fate of each hmo during cultivation of infant gut-associated bifidobacteria. bifidobacterium bifidum jcm1254, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis jcm1222, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum jcm1217, and bifidobacterium breve jcm1192 were selected for this purpose and were grown on hmo media containing a main neutral oligosaccharide fraction. the mono- and oligosaccharides in the spent media were labeled with 2-anthranilic acid, and their concentrations were determined at various incubation times using normal phase high performance liquid chromatography. the results reflect the metabolic abilities of the respective bifidobacteria. b. bifidum used secretory glycosidases to degrade hmos, whereas b. longum subsp. infantis assimilated all hmos by incorporating them in their intact forms. b. longum subsp. longum and b.  breve consumed lacto-n-tetraose only. interestingly, b. bifidum left degraded hmo metabolites outside of the cell even when the cells initiate vegetative growth, which indicates that the different species/subspecies can share the produced sugars. the predominance of type 1 chains in hmos and the preferential use of type 1 hmo by infant gut-associated bifidobacteria suggest the coevolution of the bacteria with humans.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == use of tuf gene-based primers for the pcr detection of probiotic bifidobacterium  species and enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented milk by cultural and quantitative real-time pcr methods.
AB  == due to the increasing use of bifidobacteria in probiotic products, it is essential to establish a rapid method for the qualitative and quantitative assay  of the bifidobacteria in commercial products. in this study, partial sequences of the tuf gene for 18 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 14 species were determined. alignment of these sequences showed that the similarities among these bifidobacterium species were 82.24% to 99.72%. based on these tuf gene sequences, 6 primer sets were designed for the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay of b. animalis subsp. animalis, b. animalis subsp. lactis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. longum subsp. longum, and the genus of bifidobacterium, respectively. these bifidobacterium species are common probiotic species present in dairy and probiotic products. when each target bifidobacterium spp. was assayed with the designed primers, pcr product with expected size was generated. in addition, for each target species, more than 70 bacterial strains other than the target species, including strains of other bifidobacterium species, strains of lactobacillus spp., enterococcus spp., and other bacterial species, all generated negative results. pcr assay with primers specific to b. animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. longum confirmed the presence of these bifidobacterium species in commercial yogurt products. in addition, for each product, enumeration of the bifidobacteria cells by culture method with bim-25 agar and the quantitative real-time pcr showed similar cell counts. such results indicated that within 15-d storage (4 degrees c) after manufacture, all the bifidobacteria cells originally present in yogurt products were viable and culturable during the storage.

TI  == genomics and ecological overview of the genus bifidobacterium.
AB  == members of the genus bifidobacterium are high g+c gram positive bacteria belonging to the phylum actinobacteria, and represent common inhabitants of the gastro-intestinal tract (git) of mammals, birds and certain cold-blooded animals. the overall microbial population that resides in the git, referred to as the "gut microbiota", is an extremely complex community of microorganisms whose functions  are believed to have a significant impact on human physiology. different ecological relationships between bifidobacteria and their host can be developed,  ranging from opportunistic pathogenic interactions (e.g. in the case of bifidobacterium dentium) to a commensal or even health-promoting relationship (e.g. in the case of bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium breve species).  among the known health-promoting or probiotic microorganisms, bifidobacteria represent one of the most dominant group and some bifidobacterial species are frequently used as the probiotic ingredient in many functional foods. however, despite the generally accepted importance of bifidobacteria as constituents of the human microbiota, there is only limited information available on their phylogeny, physiology and genetics. moreover, host-microbiota interactions and cross-talk between different members of the gut microbiota are far from completely understood although they represent a crucial factor in the development and maintenance of human physiology and immune system. the aim of this review is  to highlight the genetic and functional features of bifidobacteria residing in the human git using genomic and ecology-based information.

AB  == bifidobacteria in the infant faecal microbiota have been the focus of much interest, especially during the exclusive milk-feeding period and in relation to  the fortification of infant formulae to better mimic breast milk. however, longitudinal studies examining the diversity and dynamics of the bifidobacterium  population of infants are lacking, particularly in relation to the effects of weaning. using a polyphasic strategy, the bifidobacterium populations of breast-  and formula-fed infants were examined during the first 18 months of life. bifidobacterium-specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis demonstrated that breast-fed infants harboured greater diversity than formula-fed infants and  the diversity of the infants' bifidobacterium populations increased with weaning. twenty-seven distinctive banding profiles were observed from approximately 1100 infant isolates using ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, 14 biotypes of which  were confirmed to be members of the genus bifidobacterium. two profiles (h, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis; and i, bifidobacterium bifidum) were common culturable biotypes, seen in 9/10 infants, while profile e (bifidobacterium breve) was common among breast-fed infants. overall, inter- and  intra-individual differences were observed in the bifidobacterium populations of  infants between 1 and 18 months of age, although weaning was associated with increased diversity of the infant bifidobacterium populations. breast-fed infants generally harboured a more complex bifidobacterium microbiota than formula-fed infants.

AB  == the crude fractions of chitooligosaccharides (cos) and low-molar-mass chitosans (lmwc) were prepared by enzyme hydrolysis of chitosan (cs). specific growth rate  of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis and b. longum ssp. longum was determined in the presence of 0.025 and 0.5 % cos (<5 kda), lmwc (5-10 kda), and 0.025, 0.1 and 0.5% of cs, chitosan succinate and chitosan glutamate in vitro. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic; assayed by colony counting on tpy agar plates) of cos-lmwc and cs ranged from 0.025% to 0.75% of cs-lmwc. the growth of all bifidobacterial strains in the presence of chitosan, its derivatives and lmwc decreased at a concentration of 0.025%; the bacterial growth was completely inhibited at a concentration of 0.5%. cos did not show any inhibitory effect, an increased growth rate was even observed in the case of b. bifidum, b. catenulatum and b. infantis.

TI  == production of conjugated linoleic acid and conjugated linolenic acid isomers by bifidobacterium species.
AB  == conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and conjugated linolenic acid (clna) isomers have  attracted great interest because of their potential health benefits. formation of cla and clna takes place in the rumen during biohydrogenation. several studies have indicated that certain types of intestinal bacteria, including bifidobacteria, are able to convert linoleic acid (la) to cla. the role of intestinal bacteria in the formation of clna isomers is largely unknown. in the present study, a screening of 36 different bifidobacterium strains for their ability to produce cla and clna from free la and alpha-linolenic acid (lna), respectively, was performed. the strains were grown in mrs broth, to which la or  lna (0.5 mg ml(-1)) were added after 7 h of bacterial growth. cultures were further incubated at 37 degrees c for 72 h. six strains (four bifidobacterium breve strains, a bifidobacterium bifidum strain and a bifidobacterium pseudolongum strain) were able to produce different cla and clna isomers. conversion percentages varied from 19.5% to 53.5% for cla production and from 55.6% to 78.4% for clna production among these strains. the cla isomers produced  were further identified with ag(+)-hplc. la was mainly converted to t9t11-cla and c9t11-cla. the main clna isomers were identified with gc-ms as c9t11c15-clna and  t9t11c15-clna.

TI  == distinct bifidobacterium strains drive different immune responses in vitro.
AB  == in this work we evaluated the specific immune activation properties of different  bifidobacterium strains, some of the most relevant intestinal microorganisms. to  this end, we examined the in vitro effect of 12 bifidobacterium strains belonging to 4 different species, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, on the maturation pattern of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (dcs), as well as in their ability to induce cytokine secretion. in addition, we determined peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) proliferation and cytokine expression after exposure to bacterial strains. all bifidobacteria tested were able to induce full dc maturation but showed differences in the levels of cytokine production, especially il-12, il-10, tnfalpha and il-1beta, suggesting that specific cytokine ratios could be used to predict the type of th response that they may promote. in fact, analysis of cytokine production by pbmc showed that most of the tested b. animalis and b. longum strains induced the secretion of large amounts of ifngamma and tnfalpha, in agreement with the th1 profile suggested by dc cytokine production. remarkably, three of four b. bifidum strains induced poor secretion of these cytokines and significant amounts of il-17, the main product of th17 cells, in accordance with the high il-1beta/il-12 ratio observed after dc stimulation. in conclusion, this work shows species and strain-specific immune effects of bifidobacteria and describes a valuable method for screening possible  probiotic strains with different immunomodulatory properties. notably, some b. bifidum strains seem to promote th17 polarization, which could be useful for future probiotic applications.

TI  == species delineation and clonal diversity in four bifidobacterium species as revealed by multilocus sequencing.
AB  == the genus bifidobacterium comprises several species that are important contributors to the gut microbiome, with some strains having beneficial health effects. understanding the evolutionary emergence of advantageous biological properties requires knowledge of the genetic diversity and clonal structure of species. we sequenced seven housekeeping genes in 119 bifidobacterium strains of  bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum. phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences delineated sequence clusters that correspond to previously named taxa, and suggested that b. longum subsp. infantis is a nascent lineage emerging from within b. longum subsp. longum. clear traces of recombination among distant bifidobacterial species indicate leaky species borders and warn against the practice of single gene-based identification. multilocus sequence typing achieved precise strain genotyping, with discrimination indices above 99% in b. bifidum, b. breve and b. longum, providing a powerful tool for strain traceability, colonization dynamics and ecological studies. frequent homologous recombination accelerates clonal diversification and may facilitate the transfer of biological  properties among bifidobacterial strains.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == bifidobacterial enolase, a cell surface receptor for human plasminogen involved in the interaction with the host.
AB  == the interaction with the host plasminogen/plasmin system represents a novel component in the molecular cross-talk between bifidobacteria and human host. here, we demonstrated that the plasminogen-binding bifidobacterial species b. longum, b. bifidum, b. breve and b. lactis share the key glycolytic enzyme enolase as a surface receptor for human plasminogen. enolase was visualized on the cell surface of the model strain b. lactis bi07. the his-tagged recombinant protein showed a high affinity for human plasminogen, with an equilibrium dissociation constant in the nanomolar range. by site-directed mutagenesis we demonstrated that the interaction between the b. lactis bi07 enolase and human plasminogen involves an internal plasminogen-binding site homologous to that of pneumococcal enolase. according to our data, the positively charged residues lys-251 and lys-255, as well as the negatively charged glu-252, of the b. lactis  bi07 enolase are crucial for plasminogen binding. acting as a human plasminogen receptor, the bifidobacterial surface enolase is suggested to play an important role in the interaction process with the host.

TI  == a versatile and scalable strategy for glycoprofiling bifidobacterial consumption  of human milk oligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains approximately 200 complex oligosaccharides believed to stimulate the growth and establishment of a protective microbiota in the infant gut. the lack of scalable analytical techniques has hindered the measurement of bacterial metabolism of these and other complex prebiotic oligosaccharides. an in vitro, multi-strain, assay capable of measuring kinetics of bacterial growth and  detailed oligosaccharide consumption analysis by fticr-ms was developed and tested simultaneously on 12 bifidobacterial strains. for quantitative consumption, deuterated and reduced human milk oligosaccharide (hmo) standards were used. a custom software suite developed in house called glycolyzer was used  to process the large amounts of oligosaccharide mass spectra automatically with (13)c corrections based on de-isotoping protocols. high growth on hmos was characteristic of bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis strains, which consumed  nearly all available substrates, while other bifidobacterial strains tested, b. longum bv. longum, b. adolescentis, b. breve and b. bifidum, showed low or only moderate growth ability. total oligosaccharide consumption ranged from a high of  87% for b. infantis jcm 7009 to only 12% for b. adolescentis atcc 15703. a detailed analysis of consumption glycoprofiles indicated strain-specific capabilities towards differential metabolism of milk oligosaccharides. this method overcomes previous limitations in the quantitative, multi-strain analysis  of bacterial metabolism of hmos and represents a novel approach towards understanding bacterial consumption of complex prebiotic oligosaccharides.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.

TI  == probiotics modulate the bifidobacterium microbiota of elderly nursing home residents.
AB  == gut bifidobacterium microbiota of the elderly has been suggested to differ from that of adults, possibly promoting the risk of infections and gut barrier dysfunction. specific probiotics may improve the gut barrier. in this randomized, placebo-controlled intervention study, 66 elders consumed a fermented oat drink containing probiotic bifidobacterium longum 46 and b. longum 2c or a non-fermented placebo oat drink for 6 months. faecal samples were collected before, during and after the intervention. levels of faecal bifidobacteria were determined using species-specific quantitative pcr and plate counting. the bifidobacterium levels in the elderly were high and the species composition diverse. probiotic intervention increased the levels bifidobacteria significantly. specifically, the levels of b. catenulatum, b. bifidum and b. breve were enhanced. consumption of the fermented oat drink itself was also associated with certain changes in microbiota. in conclusion, bifidobacterium microbiota of elderly subjects may be modulated by probiotic administration. in some healthy elderly populations, bifidobacterium microbiota may be more abundant and diverse than previously suggested.

AB  == the bifidobacterium spp. present in 10 infant fecal samples (4 from infants with  eczema and 6 from healthy infants) were quantified with both hierarchical oligonucleotide primer extension (hope) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry. the relative abundances of bifidobacterium longum and b. catenulatum with respect to the total bifidobacteria had a poor correlation (rho, <0.600; p value, >0.208), presumably due to differences in primer specificity and the level of hybridization stringency of both methods. in  contrast, the relative abundances of organisms of the genus bifidobacterium against the total amplified 16s rrna genes and those of b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, and b. breve against the genus bifidobacterium exhibited a good statistical correlation (rho, >0.783; p value, <0.066). this good comparability supports hope as a method to achieve high-throughput quantitative determination of bacterial targets in a time- and cost-effective manner.

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

AB  == the objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by f6ppk (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time pcr (qrti-pcr). bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. dentium. bifidobacterial dna was detected by qrti-pcr in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16s rrna gene copies per ml. in conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.

TI  == gnotobiotic mouse immune response induced by bifidobacterium sp. strains isolated from infants.
AB  == bifidobacterium, which is a dominant genus in infants' fecal flora and can be used as a probiotic, has shown beneficial effects in various pathologies, including allergic diseases, but its role in immunity has so far been little known. numerous studies have shown the crucial role of the initial intestinal colonization in the development of the intestinal immune system, and bifidobacteria could play a major role in this process. for a better understanding of the effect of bifidobacterium on the immune system, we aimed at  determining the impact of bifidobacterium on the t-helper 1 (t(h)1)/t(h)2 balance by using gnotobiotic mice. germfree mice were inoculated with bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, whose genome is sequenced, and with nine bifidobacterium strains  isolated from infants' fecal flora. five days after inoculation, mice were killed. transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), interleukin-4 (il-4), il-10, and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) gene expressions in the ileum and ifn-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, il-4, and il-5 secretions by splenocytes cultivated for 48 h with concanavalin a were quantified. two bifidobacterium species had no effect (b. adolescentis) or little effect (b. breve) on the immune system. bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  dentium, and one b. longum strain induced t(h)1 and t(h)2 cytokines at the systemic and intestinal levels. one b. longum strain induced a t(h)2 orientation  with high levels of il-4 and il-10, both secreted by splenocytes, and of tgf-beta gene expression in the ileum. the other two strains induced t(h)1 orientations with high levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha splenocyte secretions. bifidobacterium's capacity to stimulate immunity is species specific, but its influence on the orientation of the immune system is strain specific.

AB  == bifidobacteria have been recommended as potential indicators of human fecal pollution in surface waters even though very little is known about their presence in nonhuman fecal sources. the objective of this research was to shed light on the occurrence and molecular diversity of this fecal indicator group in different animals and environmental waters. genus- and species-specific 16s rrna gene pcr assays were used to study the presence of bifidobacteria among 269 fecal dna extracts from 32 different animals. twelve samples from three wastewater treatment plants and 34 water samples from two fecally impacted watersheds were also tested. the species-specific assays showed that bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, and b. catenulatum had the broadest host distribution (11.9 to 17.4%), whereas b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were detected in fewer than 3% of all fecal samples. phylogenetic analysis of 356 bifidobacterial clones obtained from different animal feces showed that ca. 67% of all of the sequences clustered with cultured bifidobacteria, while the rest formed a supercluster with low sequence identity (i.e., <94%) to previously described bifidobacterium spp. the b. pseudolongum subcluster (>97% similarity) contained 53 fecal sequences from seven different animal hosts, suggesting the cosmopolitan distribution of members of this clade. in contrast, two clades containing b. thermophilum and b. boum clustered exclusively with 37 and 18 pig fecal clones, respectively, suggesting host specificity. using species-specific assays, bifidobacteria were detected in only two of the surface water dna extracts, although other fecal anaerobic bacteria were detected in these waters.  overall, the results suggest that the use of bifidobacterial species as potential markers to monitor human fecal pollution in natural waters may be questionable.

TI  == in vitro fermentability of human milk oligosaccharides by several strains of bifidobacteria.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the catabolism and fermentation of human  milk oligosaccharides (hmo) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. oligosaccharides were isolated from a pooled sample of human milk using solid-phase extraction, and then added to a growth medium as the sole source of fermentable carbohydrate. of five strains of bifidobacteria tested (bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum biovar longum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium adolescentis), b. longum bv. infantis grew better, achieving triple the cell density then the other strains. b. bifidum did not reach a high cell density, yet generated free sialic acid, fucose and n-acetylglucosamine in the media, suggesting some capacity for hmo degradation. thin layer chromatography profiles of spent fermentation broth suggests substantial degradation of oligosaccharides by b. longum bv. infantis, moderate degradation by b. bifidum and little degradation by other strains. while all strains were able to individually ferment two monosaccharide constituents of hmo, glucose and galactose, only b. longum bv. infantis and b. breve were able to ferment glucosamine, fucose and sialic acid. these results suggest that as a potential prebiotic, hmo may selectively promote  the growth of certain bifidobacteria strains, and their catabolism may result in  free monosaccharides in the colonic lumen.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bifidobacterial microbiota in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == aim: to characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis. methods: a sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for their condition.  bacterial dna was extracted from the resected mucosal samples and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative pcr. results: bifidobacteria were found in  100% of the samples from patients with diverticulitis or ibd and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. the species b. longum and b. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by b. animalis, b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis. b. breve, b.  dentium and b. angulatum were not detected in any sample. a significantly higher  occurrence of b. longum was observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or ibd (100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, p < 0.05). similar results were obtained for b. animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, p < 0.05), while  b. adolescentis was only found in the mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). at the quantitative level, patients with colon cancer or ibd showed lower counts of total bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, p < 0.05) and of the species b. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, p < 0.05) than those with diverticulitis. conclusion: aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different intestinal diseases. this may indicate a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

TI  == quantitative assessment of faecal bifidobacterial populations by real-time pcr using lanthanide probes.
AB  == aim: to develop real-time quantitative pcr methods, based on the use of probes labelled with a stable fluorescent lanthanide chelate, for the quantification of  different human faecal bifidobacterial populations. methods and results: the designed quantitative pcr assays were found to be specific for the corresponding  bifidobacterium species or groups (bifidobacterium longum group, bifidobacterium  catenulatum group, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium).  the detection limits of the methodologies used ranged between 2 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(3) cells g(-1) of faeces. the applicability of the developed assays was tested by analysing 20 human faecal samples. bif. longum group was found to be the qualitatively and quantitatively predominant bifidobacterial group. conclusions:  the real-time pcr procedures developed here are specific, accurate, rapid and easy methods for the quantification of bifidobacterium groups or species in human faecal samples. significance and impact of the study: the developed procedures will facilitate rapid and objective counting of large numbers of samples increasing our knowledge on the role of gut bifidobacterial microbiota in health  and disease. this will contribute to the efficient use of intestinal bacterial assays in research, food and pharmaceutical development as well as in the assessment of dietary management of diseases.

TI  == selective colonization of insoluble substrates by human faecal bacteria.
AB  == insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. the object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. recovered substrates were extensively washed and the  remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s rrna gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. the substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster xiva bacteria, including uncultured relatives of clostridium hathewayi, eubacterium rectale and roseburia species. bacteroides species were also detected. the most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species ruminococcus bromii, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve and e. rectale. the most commonly recovered sequences from  mucin were from bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to ruminococcus lactaris. this study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is  likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. for a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals.

TI  == establishment and follow-up of bifidobacterial species in the gut of healthy bottle-fed infants of 1-4 months age.
AB  == twenty-one healthy bottle-fed infants were screened monthly (1-4 months) for bifidobacteria in their stools. bifidobacteria were detected by culture and isolates specified by pcr. alternatively, direct pcr in undiluted fecal suspensions was carried out for detection of bifidobacteria under the cultural detection level. all infants harbored cultivable bifidobacteria throughout the study period. beerens medium was shown to permit a better recovery of bifidobacteria than mrs and horse blood columbia agar. direct pcr detection proved valuable in detecting species for which no cultural isolate could be recovered since the species were under the cultural detection level. b. bifidum,  b. longum-infantis and b. breve were confirmed as dominant and stable species in  infant stools while b. adolescentis and b. catenulatum group exhibited unstable colonization profiles. a trend towards b. breve decrease began at month 3 while carriage of the b. catenulatum group and b. adolescentis was rising. this observation warrants further analysis to assess a possible switch occurring at month 3 in bottle-fed infants, between so-called infant and adult bifidobacterial species.

TI  == population dynamics of bifidobacterium species in human feces during raffinose administration monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry.
AB  == the population dynamics of bifidobacteria in human feces during raffinose administration were investigated at the species level by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) coupled with flow cytometry (fcm) analysis. although double-staining fish-fcm using both fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) and indodicarbocyanine (cy5) as labeling dyes for fecal samples has been reported, the analysis was interfered with by strong autofluorescence at the fitc fluorescence region because of the presence of autofluorescence particles/debris  in the fecal samples. we circumvented this problem by using only cy5 fluorescent  dye in the fish-fcm analysis. thirteen subjects received 2 g of raffinose twice a day for 4 weeks. fecal samples were collected, and the bifidobacterial populations were monitored using the established fish-fcm method. the results showed an increase in bifidobacteria from about 12.5% of total bacteria in the prefeeding period to about 28.7 and 37.2% after the 2-week and 4-week feeding periods, respectively. bifidobacterium adolescentis, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and bifidobacterium longum were the major species, in that order, at the prefeeding period, and these bacteria were found to increase nearly in parallel during the raffinose administration. during the feeding periods, indigenous bifidobacterial populations became more diverse, such that minor species in human adults, such as bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bifidobacterium dentium, and bifidobacterium angulatum, proliferated. four weeks  after raffinose administration was stopped, the proportion of each major bifidobacterial species, as well as that of total bifidobacteria, returned to approximately the original values for the prefeeding period, whereas that of each minor species appeared to differ considerably from its original value. to the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear demonstration of the population dynamics of indigenous bifidobacteria at the species level in response to raffinose administration.

TI  == [a molecular-and-genetic analysis of species and strain diversity of bifidobacteria in early childhood].
AB  == the species and strain composition of bifidobacteria in 29 children both sexes, aged 8 to 16 months, was studied. species-specific primers and pcr were used to determine to which species the predominant strains of bifidobacteria, isolated from feces by cultural methods, belonged. bifidobacteria were found in 28 (96.5%) children; their number was 10.2 +/- 0.7 ecu per a gram of the material. b. longum and b. bifidum were frequent (71.4 and 53.5%, respectively). the level of quantitative detection used in the study also allowed revealing of b. catenulatum (17.9%) and b. breve (14.4%). a high titer of b. dentium was found in one case (3.6%). b. adolescentis and b. angulatum were not found in any patient. the average number of species found in one child was 1.7 +/- 0.7. rapd-pcr and investigation of plasmid profile were used to determine possible belonging of the isolates to different strains. the average number of strains per one sample was 2.3 +/- 1.2. nine unique plasmid bifidobacterial strains were isolated from 7 children. in 3 children the intestinal tract was found to be colonized by both plasmid and non-plasmid-carrying strains of one bifidobacterial species.

AB  == aims: to determine the level of bifidobacteria in bio-yoghurts in the uk, identify the species, and compare the resistance of common bifidobacterium spp. to acidity and oxidative stress. methods and results: a storage trial of bio-yoghurts was carried out to determine the level and survival of bifidobacteria. the 16s rrna gene targeted pcr was used to identify the species.  acid tolerance was determined by introducing the organisms to ph-adjusted skimmed milk and enumerating during storage at 4 degrees c. oxidative stress resistance was determined using the h(2)o(2) disc diffusion assay technique. nine of 10 bio-yoghurts contained bifidobacteria at levels >10(6) cfu g(-1) at the time of purchase. the viability of the organism decreased during storage and on expiry only five products retained viability >10(6) cfu g(-1) while two others were very close to the target population. bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis showed superior survival abilities and stress tolerance compared with bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum biotype infantis. conclusions: bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis, the only bifidobacterium spp. found in bio-yoghurts, had the greatest resistance to acidity and oxidative stress. significance and impact of the study: the technological properties of b. animalis ssp. lactis make it suitable for inclusion in bio-yoghurts although its putative  health benefits need further investigation.

TI  == rapid identification of potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s rrna.
AB  == this study aimed at developing a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  primer set for identification of the potentially probiotic bifidobacterium species b. adolescentis, b. animalis subsp. animalis (b. animalis), b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum biovar infantis (b. infantis), b. animalis subsp. lactis b. lactis, b. longum biovar longum (b. longum) and b. pseudolongum. the primer set comprised specific and conserved primers and was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna genes and the rrna intergenic spacer region (isr) of each species. it could detect and identify type strains and isolates from pharmaceuticals or dairy products corresponding to the eight bifidobacterium species with high specificity. it was also useful for screening of the related strains from natural sources such as the gastro-intestinal tract and feces. we suggest that the assay system from this study is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of bifidobacterium species for which probiotic  strains are known.

TI  == culture-dependent and culture-independent qualitative analysis of probiotic products claimed to contain bifidobacteria.
AB  == a total of 58 probiotic products obtained worldwide, which were claimed to contain bifidobacterium strains (including 22 yoghurts, 5 dairy fruit drinks, 28  food supplements and 3 pharmaceutical preparations) were investigated in parallel using a culture-dependent and a culture-independent approach. three isolation media previously reported as selective for bifidobacterium were evaluated for their suitability in the quality analysis of these products. subsequently, possible bifidobacterial colonies were picked from the best medium and identified by means of rep-pcr fingerprinting using the box primer (box-pcr). bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, formerly classified as bifidobacterium lactis, was most frequently found, but strains belonging to bifidobacterium longum biotypes longum and infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium  breve were recovered also. in parallel, all products were also subjected to culture-independent analysis which involved a nested-pcr step on total bacterial  dna extracted directly from the product, followed by separation of the amplicons  by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and subsequent identification of species from the band patterns. by conventional cultivation, 70.7% of the products analysed were found to contain culturable bifidobacteria whereas by culture-independent dgge analysis members of the genus bifidobacterium could be detected in 96.5% of the analysed products. genotypic characterization of a number of bifidobacterial isolates at the strain level by means of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) revealed a relatively high degree of genomic homogeneity among the bifidobacterium strains currently used in the probiotic industry.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr assays to identify and quantify fecal bifidobacterium  species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == a healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the  infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different bifidobacterium species. it has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific bifidobacterium species than healthy infants. for the accurate quantification of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples, duplex 5' nuclease assays  were developed. the assays, targeting rrna gene intergenic spacer regions, were validated and compared with conventional pcr and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. the 5' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (osf). a breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference. the results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria (54.8% +/- 9.8% to 73.4% +/- 4.0%) in infants receiving the prebiotic formula (osf), with a diversity of bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis (2.71% +/- 1.92% and 8.11% +/- 4.12%, respectively, versus 0.15% +/- 0.11% and 1.38% +/- 0.98% for the osf group). in conclusion, the specific prebiotic infant  formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of  breast-fed infants also at the level of the different bifidobacterium species.

TI  == mining the microbiota of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract for conjugated linoleic acid-producing bifidobacteria.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate different strains of the genus bifidobacterium from the fecal material of neonates and to assess their ability to produce the cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (cla) isomer from free linoleic acid. fecal material was collected from 24 neonates aged between 3 days and 2 months in a neonatal unit (erinville hospital, cork, ireland). a total of 46 isolates from  six neonates were confirmed to be bifidobacterium species based on a combination  of the fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase assay, rapd [random(ly) amplified polymorphic dna] pcr, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), and partial 16s ribosomal dna sequencing. interestingly, only 1 of the 11 neonates that had received antibiotic treatment produced bifidobacteria. pfge after genomic digestion with the restriction enzyme xbai demonstrated that the bifidobacteria population displayed considerable genomic diversity among the neonates, with each containing between one and five dominant strains, whereas 11 different macro restriction patterns were obtained. in only one case did a single strain appear in two neonates. all genetically distinct strains were then screened for cla production after 72 h of incubation with 0.5 mg of free linoleic acid ml(-1) by using gas-liquid chromatography. the most efficient producers belonged to the species bifidobacterium breve, of which two different strains converted 29 and 27% of the free linoleic acid to the cis-9, trans-11 isomer per microgram of dry  cells, respectively. in addition, a strain of bifidobacterium bifidum showed a conversion rate of 18%/microg dry cells. the ability of some bifidobacterium strains to produce cla could be another human health-promoting property linked to members of the genus, given that this metabolite has demonstrated anticarcinogenic activity in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == development of multi-color fish method for analysis of seven bifidobacterium species in human feces.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria secrete metabolites retaining anti-inflammatory properties after intestinal transport.
AB  == background: probiotic bacteria have a beneficial effect on intestinal inflammation. in this study, we have examined the effect of lactic acid and commensal gram positive (+) bacteria conditioned media (cm) on tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release and the mechanisms involved. methods: lipopolysaccharide (lps) induced tnf-alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the thp-1 cell line was monitored in the presence or absence of bacteria cm obtained from two probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (bb) and streptococcus thermophilus (st), and three commensal bacterial strains (bifidobacterium bifidum, ruminococcus gnavus, and unidentified streptococcus). bb and st bacteria cm were allowed to cross filter grown intestinal epithelial cell monolayers (ht29-19a) to assess intestinal transport of active bacterial products. these products were characterised and their effect on lps binding to thp-1 cells and nuclear factor kappa b (nf kappa b) activation assessed. results: dose dependent inhibition of lps induced tnf-alpha secretion was noted for both probiotic bacteria cm (64% and 71% inhibition for bb and st, respectively) and to a lesser extent commensal bacteria cm (21-32% inhibition). active products from bb and st were resistant to digestive enzymes and had a molecular mass <3000 da.  their inhibitory effect was preserved after transepithelial transport across intestinal cell monolayers, mainly in inflammatory conditions. lps-fitc binding to thp-1 cells and nf kappa b activation were significantly inhibited by bb and st cm. conclusion: b breve and s thermophilus release metabolites exerting an anti-tnf-alpha effect capable of crossing the intestinal barrier. commensal bacteria also display a tnf-alpha inhibitory capacity but to a lesser extent. these results underline the beneficial effect of commensal bacteria in intestinal homeostasis and may explain the role of some probiotic bacteria in alleviating digestive inflammation.

TI  == probiotic bifidobacteria protect mice from lethal infection with shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == the anti-infectious activity of probiotic bifidobacteria against shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157:h7 was examined in a fatal mouse stec infection model. stable colonization of the murine intestines was achieved by the oral administration of bifidobacterium breve strain yakult (naturally resistant to streptomycin sulfate) as long as the mice were treated with streptomycin in their drinking water (5 mg/ml). the pathogenicity of stec infection, characterized by marked body weight loss and subsequent death, observed in the infected controls was dramatically inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. moreover, stx production by stec cells in the intestine was almost completely inhibited in the b. breve-colonized group. a comparison of  anti-stec activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance  to streptomycin revealed that strains such as bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 15696  and bifidobacterium catenulatum atcc 27539(t) did not confer an anti-infectious activity, despite achieving high population levels similar to those of effective  strains, such as b. breve strain yakult and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. the effective strains produced a high concentration of acetic acid (56 mm) and lowered the ph of the intestine (to ph 6.75) compared to the infected control group (acetic acid concentration, 28 mm; ph, 7.15); these effects were thought to be related to the anti-infectious activity of these strains because the combination of a high concentration of acetic acid and a low ph was found to inhibit stx production during stec growth in vitro.

TI  == genus- and species-specific pcr primers for the detection and identification of bifidobacteria.
AB  == 16srdna-targeted genus- and species-specific pcr primers have been developed and  used for the identification and detection of bifidobacteria. these primers cover  all of the described species that inhabit the human gut, or occur in dairy products. identification of cultured bifidobacteria using pcr primer pairs is rapid and accurate, being based on nucleic acid sequences. detection of bifidobacteria can be achieved using dna extracted from human faeces as template  in pcr reactions. we have found that, in adult faeces, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group was the most commonly detected species, followed by bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium bifidum. in breastfed infants, bifidobacterium breve was the most frequently detected species, followed by bifidobacterium infantis, b. longum and b. bifidum. it was notable that the b. catenulatum group was detected with the highest frequency in adults, although it has often been reported that b. adolescentis is  the most common species. real-time, quantitative pcr using primers targeting 16s  rdna shows promise in the enumeration of bifidobacteria in faecal samples. the approach to detect the target bacteria with quantitative pcr described in this review will contribute to future studies of the composition and dynamics of the intestinal microflora.

TI  == multiplex pcr using 16s rrna gene-targeted primers for the identification of bifidobacteria from human origin.
AB  == three multiplex polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) targeted on bifidobacterium and related species were designed to identify human species. the selected primers yielded amplified products of various sizes, each specific for a species. three to four pairs were gathered in one pcr reaction and their specificity under multiplex conditions was confirmed using dna from 26 reference strains. using this technique on unidentified faecal strains, b. bifidum, b. longum and b. breve species were commonly recovered in infants while b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum/b. pseudocatenulatum continuum and b. longum species were predominant in adults. thus, a single pcr can provide the assignment of a strain to one these species, reducing the number of pcr reactions and hands-on time for the identification of human isolates of bifidobacteria. moreover, this technique is also applicable for the in situ detection of bifidobacteria in dna extracts from  human stools.

TI  == species specific identification of nine human bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  == based on the 16s rdna sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by dna amplification of nine human bifidobacterium spp., namely b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum. b. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. the primers were designed to  target different positions of the 16s rdna, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. the identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an alui restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16s rdna. this multiple primer dna amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. the technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in  separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.

TI  == stimulation of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by bifidobacterium strains.
AB  == to characterize the ability of bifidobacteria to affect the production of macrophage-derived cytokines, a murine macrophage-like cell line, j774.1, was cultured in the presence of 27 strains of heat-inactivated bifidobacteria. bifidobacterium adolescentis and b. longum, known as adult-type bifidobacteria, induced significantly more pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, il-12 and tnf-alpha, by j774.1 cells, than did the infant-type bifidobacteria, b. bifidum,  b. breve, and b. infantis (p<0.01). in contrast, b. adolescentis did not stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory il-10 from j774.1 cells as the other tested bacteria did. the results suggest that the adult-type bifidobacteria, especially b. adolescentis, may be more potent to amplify but less able to down-regulate the inflammatory response.

TI  == selection of human isolates of bifidobacteria for their use as probiotics.
AB  == an attempt was made to isolate human strains of bifidobacteria, all together 36,  from fecal samples of 15 breast-fed infants ages 1-6 mo. these isolates were checked for their ability to grow in the presence of 1-3% bile, 0.2-0.4% phenol,  and low ph (3.0-5.0) in vitro, to evaluate their capacity to grow under hostile and unfavorable conditions of the human digestive tract. because milk is to be used as a carrier medium, their ability to grow in 10% sterile skim milk was also evaluated. the bifidobacteria count of the cultured milk samples (0, 24, and 48 h) was taken on tryptone yeast extract agar after 48 h of incubation in the presence of 10% co2 at 37 degrees c. the changes in ph and developed titratable acidity were also recorded up to 96 h of incubation. the results indicated that all the isolates obtained had reasonable resistance to ph, bile, and phenol and were capable of growing well in milk. among the 36 isolates, bifidobacterium bifidum (isolates no. 4, 8, and 17) and b. breve (isolates no. 25 and 26) were the most tolerant to unfavorable conditions, and they may therefore be recommended for use in fermented milk or baby food formulations as probiotic dietary adjuncts.

TI  == production of oligosaccharides in yogurt containing bifidobacteria and yogurt cultures.
AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == increased resistance of mice to salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium infection by synbiotic administration of bifidobacteria and transgalactosylated oligosaccharides.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of bifidobacteria in combination with transgalactosylated oligosaccharides (tos) against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt-2 in an opportunistic antibiotic-induced murine infection model in mice was examined. methods and results: b. breve (strain yakult) with natural resistance to streptomycin sulphate (sm, mic: > 4 mg ml(-1)), when given daily at a dose of 108 cfu/mouse orally under sm treatment was constantly excreted at 10(10) cfu g(-1) faeces so long as sm was administered, even at 2 weeks after discontinuing administration of b. breve. explosive intestinal growth and subsequent extra-intestinal translocation of orally infected lt-2 under sm treatment were inhibited by b. breve colonization, and this anti-infectious activity was strengthened by synbiotic administration of tos with b. breve. comparison of anti-salmonella activity among several bifidobacterium strains with natural resistance to sm revealed that strains such as b. bifidum atcc 15696 and  b. catenulatum atcc 27539t conferred no activity, even when they reached high population levels similar those of effective strains such as strain yakult and b. pseudocatenulatum dsm 20439. both the increase in the concentration of organic acids and the lowered ph in the intestine due to bifidobacterial colonization correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, the crude cecal extract of b. breve-colonized mice exerted growth-inhibitory activity against lt-2 in vitro, whereas that of the ineffective b. bifidum-colonized cecum showed much lower activity. conclusions: intestinal colonization by bifidobacteria given exogenously together with tos during antibiotic treatment prevents the antibiotic-induced disruption of colonization resistance to oral infection with s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and the metabolic activity needed to produce organic acids and lower the intestinal ph is important in the anti-infectious activity of synbiotics against enteric infection with salmonella. significance and impact of the study: these results indicate that certain bifidobacteria together with prebiotics may be used for the prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

TI  == adhesive property of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512 and predominant bacteria of intestinal microflora to human intestinal mucin.
AB  == the adhesive property to the intestinal mucin of bifidobacterium lactis lkm512, b. longum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus acidophilus were examined. adhesive rate of lkm512 to the mucin was significantly (p < 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001) stronger than the other strains from 2 to 100 time. though the adhesive property  of many strains was almost same to the mucin of 20-year-old and 50-year-old generations, in case of 4-month-old was different. adhesive inhibitory effect of  c. perfringens to the mucin by lkm512 was examined. under the condition that lkm512 was 108/ml and that c. perfringens was 106/ml, adhesion of c. perfringens  to the mucin was inhibited at 99.6%, when lkm512 adhered in advance. there was the strong inhibition of adhesion at 74.0%, when c. perfringens adhered to mucin  in advance. thus, lkm512 can inhibit the adhesion of harmful bacteria to the intestinal mucin, the possibility of using as a probiotic strain has to be verified.

TI  == effect of honey on the growth of and acid production by human intestinal bifidobacterium spp.: an in vitro comparison with commercial oligosaccharides and inulin.
AB  == five human intestinal bifidobacterium spp., b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, and b. infantis, were cultured in reinforced clostridial medium (control) and in reinforced clostridial medium supplemented with 5% (wt/vol) honey, fructooligosaccharide (fos), galactooligosaccharide (gos), and inulin. inoculated samples were incubated anaerobically at 37degrees c for 48 h. samples  were collected at 12-h intervals and examined for specific growth rate. levels of fermentation end products (lactic and acetic acids) were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. honey enhanced the growth of the five cultures much like fos, gos, and inulin did. honey, fos, gos, and inulin were especially effective (p < 0.05) in sustaining the growth of these cultures after  24 h of incubation as compared with the control treatment. overall, the effects of honey on lactic and acetic acid production by intestinal bifidobacterium spp.  were similar to those of fos, gos, and inulin.

TI  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
AB  == lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named  catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l.  reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.

TI  == preventive effects of bifidobacterium- and lactobacillus-fermented milk on the development of inflammatory bowel disease in senescence-accelerated mouse p1/yit  strain mice.
AB  == background/aims: we recently discovered inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) in the ileum and cecum of samp1/yit strain mice under specific pathogen-free (spf) conditions. to determine the effect of lactic acid bacteria (lab - bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum and lactobacillus acidophilus)-fermented milk on the prevention of ibd in samp1/yit strain mice, we compared the disease severity on the intestinal inflammation among the group of mice fed saline, unfermented milk or lab-fermented milk. methods: three-week-old  samp1/yit strain mice (n = 72) were subdivided into three groups, that were fed saline, unfermented milk and lab-fermented milk, respectively. the diets were orally administered daily via a gastric tube. when the mice reached 20 weeks of age, they were sacrificed and the ibd scores were compared among the three groups. results: administration of the lab-fermented milk to samp1/yit strain mice reduced histological injury score, compared with those in saline-treated or  unfermented milk-treated samp1/yit strain mice. ileal tissue weight and myeloperoxidase activity also reduced by treatment of lab-fermented milk. moreover, the tissue contents of immunoglobulins such as igg1 and igg2a were lower in the inflammatory regions in the samp1/yit strain group fed lab-fermented milk than that fed saline and unfermented milk. cytokine-specific elisa assays indicated the production of t-helper 1 cytokines such as interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the culture supernatants of mln cells in the samp1/yit strain group fed lab-fermented milk was lower than those fed saline and unfermented milk. on the contrary, the production of interleukin-10 in mln cells  increased by prevention with lab-fermented milk. conclusion: lab-fermented milk is beneficial for the treatment of murine ibd and this effect may be modulated through stabilization of the mucosal immunity by lab.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == enhanced antigen-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity and immunoglobulin g2b responses after oral administration of viable lactobacillus casei yit9029 in wistar and brown norway rats.
AB  == in this study, the effects of orally administered viable lactobacillus casei shirota strain yit9029 on the immunity parameters of wistar and brown norway rats were examined. for this purpose, we used the trichinella spiralis host resistance model. two weeks before and during t. spiralis infection, rats were fed 10(9) viable l. casei bacteria 5 days per week. the t. spiralis-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth) response was significantly enhanced in both wistar and brown norway rats given l. casei. in both rat strains fed l. casei, serum t. spiralis-specific immunoglobulin g2b (igg2b) concentrations were also significantly increased. in the model, no significant effects of l. casei on larval counts or inflammatory reactions in the tongue musculature, body weights,  or lymphoid organ weights were observed. serum specific antibody responses, other than igg2b, were not changed by feeding of l. casei. in contrast to l. casei, it  was shown that orally administered bifidobacterium breve or bifidobacterium bifidum had no influence on the measured infection and immunity indices in the rat infection model. since the rat dth response is considered to be a manifestation of th1 cell-mediated immunity and the igg2b isotype has been associated with th1 activity, it was concluded that th1 cells could play an active role in the immunomodulatory effects of orally administered l. casei. furthermore, our data do not indicate that the effect of oral supplementation with l. casei is dependent on the genetic background of the host.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

(lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == ability of lactoferrin to promote the growth of bifidobacterium spp. in vitro is  independent of receptor binding capacity and iron saturation level.
AB  == lactoferrin (lf) is an iron-binding protein which has been shown to inhibit the growth of various bacterial pathogens and promote the growth of anaerobic bacteria of the genus bifidobacterium in vitro. the present study was designed to investigate whether the bifidobacteria growth promotion activity of lf is correlated with either the binding of lf to bifidobacterial cells or the iron saturation of lf. bovine lf (blf) from mature milk increased the growth of b. infantis and b. breve in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion, while much less growth promotion activity was found for b. bifidum. in contrast, human lf (hulf)  from mature milk promoted the growth of b. bifidum and was inactive for b. infantis and b. breve, while blf from colostrum was devoid of bifidobacteria growth promotion activity. changes in the iron content of lf did not alter the bifidobacteria growth promotion activity of either blf or hulf preparations. competitive binding studies with biotinylated milk blf showed that binding of blf was inhibited by unlabelled blf and hulf but not by beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-lactalbumin or transferrin. binding of blf to b. bifidum and b. breve was c. 40-fold higher than binding to escherichia coli. colostrum blf was also found  to bind to b. bifidum and b. breve, despite a lack of in-vitro growth promotion activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that the ability of lf to promote the growth of bifidobacterium spp. in vitro is independent of the iron saturation level for lf and suggest that binding of lf to bifidobacteria cells may be involved but is not sufficient for stimulation of bifidobacterial growth.

AB  == twenty-five bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant feces were identified by sugar fermentation patterns and whole-cell protein analysis. using gradient sds-page, six characteristic protein bands of the genus were detected in 40 strains of bifidobacteria but not in lactobacilli. computerized numerical analysis enabled strains to be grouped in two main clusters. strains of bifidobacterium bifidum belong to a well-differentiated cluster that joins the cluster of the remaining species at 0.582 similarity. the predominant species among isolated strains from infant feces were b. bifidum, b. longum, and b. breve. probiotic and technological indicators such as surface properties, inhibitory capacity, resistance to bile and low ph, and ability to grow under aerobic conditions were studied. not all desirable characteristics were present in a single strain. in general, adherent and inhibitory strains were not resistant to bile, low ph, and aerobic conditions. only 10 of 40 strains were resistant to 0.5% bile.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of potentially probiotic bifidobacterium isolates from  the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == sixteen bifidobacterium isolates from the human gastrointestinal tract were assayed for susceptibility to 44 antibiotics by soft agar overlay disc diffusion  on tpy agar. five isolates (3/7 b. bifidum and 2/3 b. breve) exhibited atypical antibiotic susceptibility profiles. poor growth in the agar overlay accounted for susceptibility of b. bifidum but not b. breve isolates. all other isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (30 micrograms), aztreonam (30 micrograms), vancomycin (30 micrograms), amikacin (30 micrograms), gentamicin (10 micrograms), kanamycin (30  micrograms), streptomycin (10 micrograms), fusidic acid (10 micrograms), trimethoprim (5 micrograms), norfloxacin (10 micrograms), nalidixic acid (30 micrograms), metronidazole (5 micrograms), polymyxin b (300 micrograms) and colistin sulphate (10 micrograms), and they were susceptible to the six penicillins studied, cephalothin (30 micrograms), cefuroxime (30 micrograms), cefaclor (30 micrograms), ceftizoxime (30 micrograms), cefotaxime (30 micrograms), bacitracin (10 micrograms), chloramphenicol (30 micrograms), erythromycin (15 micrograms), clindamycin (2 micrograms), rifampicin (5 micrograms) and nitrofurantoin (300 micrograms). in addition, they varied in their susceptibility to cephradine (30 micrograms), cephazolin (30 micrograms), cefoperazone (75 micrograms), ceftriaxone (30 micrograms), ofloxacin (5 micrograms) and furazolidone (15 micrograms). they were resistant, or only marginally moderately susceptible, to ceftazidime (30 micrograms), netilmicin (10 micrograms), sulphamethoxazole (100 micrograms), cotrimoxazole (25 micrograms) and ciprofloxacin (5 micrograms), and susceptible or marginally moderately susceptible to tetracycline (30 micrograms). all b. bifidum isolates were susceptible to cefixime (5 micrograms). four microorganism-drug combinations were evaluated for beta-lactamase activity but its absence suggested that cell wall impermeability was responsible for cephalosporin resistance among bifidobacteria. the antibiotic susceptibility of b. animalis 25527t was similar to that of the human isolates.

TI  == development and application of an in vitro methodology to determine the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in the upper human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == an in vitro methodology which mimics in vivo human upper gastrointestinal transit was developed. the transit tolerance of potentially probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37  degrees c to a simulated gastric juice (ph 2.0), containing pepsin (0.3% w/v) and sodium chloride (0.5% w/v), and a simulated small intestinal juice (ph 8.0), containing pancreatin usp (1 g l-1) and sodium chloride (5 g l-1), and monitoring changes in total viable count periodically. the methodology was also employed to  determine the effect of adding milk proteins (1 g l-1), hog gastric mucin (1 g l-1) and soyabean trypsinchymotrypsin inhibitor [sbtci] (1 g l-1) on transit tolerance. the majority (14 of 15) of isolates lost > 90% viability during simulated gastric transit. only one isolate, lactobacillus fermentum kld, was considered intrinsically resistant. the addition of milk proteins, singly and in  combination, generally improved gastric transit tolerance. in this regard, two isolates, lact. casei 212.3 and bifidobacterium infantis 25962, exhibited 100% gastric transit tolerance in the presence of milk proteins. in general, the addition of hog gastric mucin did not influence simulated gastric transit tolerance of lactobacilli but tended to increase that of bifidobacteria. however, it increased that of lact. casei 242 and lact. salivarius 43338 but diminished that of b. bifidum 2715 and b. animalis bo. selected bile salts-resistant isolates were intrinsically tolerant to simulated small intestinal transit. only  lact. casei f19 and b. adolescentis 15703t showed significant reduction in viability after 240 min. in general, the addition of milk proteins and sbtci did  not affect simulated small intestinal transit tolerance. however, they significantly improved the intrinsic resistance of lact. casei f19 but diminished that of b. breve 15700t. it is concluded that, whereas the majority of bile salts-resistant lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may be intrinsically sensitive to gastric transit, they are intrinsically resistant to small intestinal transit. in addition, it is postulated that milk proteins and mucin may function as both buffering agents and inhibitors of digestive protease activity in vivo, thereby protecting ingested bacterial strains during upper gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == growth, viability, and proteolytic activity of bifidobacteria in whole camel milk.
AB  == four species of bifidobacteria were evaluated for growth, viability, and proteolytic activity in whole camel milk, and comparison was made with whole cow  milk. growth of all species in either whole milk was characterized by the appearance of two logarithmic phases following anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 36 h. the growth rate of bifidobacterium longum 15,707 was higher in camel  milk than in bovine milk and was higher for bifidobacterium angulatum 27,535 in bovine milk than in camel milk. bifidobacterium bifidum 2715 and bifidobacterium  breve 2258 showed the same trend as b. angulatum 27,535 after 16 h of postinoculation. viable counts of all species except b. bifidum 2715 increased in the fermented whole milks during the first 3 d of storage at 4 degrees c. however, such counts did not change in unfermented milk, except for b. longum 15,707, which showed an increase in viable counts after 12 d of storage. viability of all species in both fermented and unfermented milks was unaffected during refrigerated storage for 15 d. all species except b. longum 15,707 showed  higher proteolytic activity in fermented camel milk than in bovine milk. however, proteolytic activity of all species except b. breve 2258 started at d 9 in unfermented camel milk only and increased sharply until the end of the storage period.

TI  == digoxigenin-labeled deoxyribonucleic acid probes for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == the numbers of bifidobacteria in fecal samples were specifically determined by colony hybridization with the mixture of digoxigenin-labeled dna probes that were prepared from whole chromosomal dna of bifidobacterium longum 6001 and bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003. these dna probes strongly hybridized with dna  of b. longum, b. adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium angulatum, and bifidobacterium animalis. detectable positive signals with dna of bifidobacterium pseudolongum ssp. pseudolongum, bifidobacterium catenulatum, and bifidobacterium  thermophilum were also found after hybridization. when dot-blot hybridization was performed with whole cells of 47 reference strains containing 11 species (16 strains) of bifidobacteria, all of the bifidobacteria tested could be specifically detected by using these dna probes; lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173, however, showed a slight nonspecific signal. the counts of bifidobacteria by colony hybridization in the fecal samples of four of the five subjects were the same as the counts that were obtained by the conventional method using bl agar medium. furthermore, no significant difference existed in the number of bifidobacteria that were determined by either method.

TI  == effect of bifidogenic factors on growth characteristics of bifidobacteria in infant formulas.
AB  == a bifidogenic factor, lactulose or fructooligosaccharides, was added (0.5%) into  infant formula based on soy or infant formula with hydrolyzed casein. the infant  formulas were then inoculated (2.5%) with bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 15696), bifidobacterium breve (atcc 15700), bifidobacterium infantis (atcc 15697), or bifidobacterium longum (atcc 15708) or their mixture (mixed culture) and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. lactulose did not influence maximal counts or generation times in either formula for any species except b. infantis, which had  lower counts. trends of developed acidity and ph of the mixed culture in the infant formulas with or without lactulose were similar to those for b. breve. maximal counts and generation times remained unchanged with or without fructooligosaccharides for all species and the mixed culture, except for b. bifidum in the formula based on soy, for which maximal counts did not occur. growth in either formula was inhibited for b. infantis with lactulose and b. breve with fructooligosaccharides past 8 h of inoculation.

TI  == growth characteristics of bifidobacteria in infant formulas.
AB  == four species of bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium bifidum (atcc 15696), bifidobacterium breve (atcc 15700), bifidobacterium infantis (atcc 15697), and bifidobacterium longum (atcc 15708), were grown anaerobically at 37 degrees c in  lactobacilli mrs broth with 0.5% cysteine-hc1 and inoculated at 2.5% into three types of infant formula (based on soy, or milk, or casein hydrolysate) and in nonfat milk followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 h. in most cases, the logarithmic phase of growth for all species varied from the first 8 to 12 h postinoculation. generation times for b. longum and b. breve were similar, and times for b. infantis were shortest, in all of the formulas. trends for lactic acid production for all species in all the formulas were similar to trends for acetic acid production. counts for formulas based on soy or milk were similar for all species except b. bifidum, and those for casein-hydrolyzed formula were always lowest for all species except b. bifidum, for which count was maximal with the formula based on soy. results suggest that growth characteristics of bifidobacteria in infant formula were species specific and formula dependent and  that growth was maximal in the formula based on milk.

TI  == differentiation of bifidobacteria by use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and  polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == several different genomic fingerprints can be obtained from various commercially-important species of bifidobacterium using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) following digestion of dna with xbai and spei. four different genomic finger printings were discernible for reference strains of bifidobacterium animalis, five for b. bifidum, three for b. breve, five for b. infantis and three for b. longum. standard commercially-available industrial strains of b. animalis are identical to the reference strain atcc 27536, previously isolated from chicken feces. there was more genomic heterogeneity among industrial strains of b. longum, in that only one gave profiles similar to  the type strain of this species (atcc 15707). the other 14 commercially-available strains of b. longum (mainly isolated from japanese commercial preparations) were divided into four new molecular types based on their pfge patterns. the pfge method indicated that only five distinct strains of b. longum and one strain of b. animalis are used in commercial preparations. additionally, the use of polymerase chain reaction amplification of portions of 16s rdna provides a highly specific technique to discriminate between the species b. breve, b. infantis and  b. longum.

TI  == influence of two infant formulas and human milk on the development of the faecal  flora in newborn infants.
AB  == the establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on  breast milk (n = 20) or with two different modern adapted cow's milk formulas (n  = 19) was studied during the first 3 months of life. one formula investigated was based on 100% bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40. a faecal flora  rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups; the growth of putrefactive  bacteria (especially bacteroides spp.), however, was limited. in formula-fed infants, significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants. similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. infantis and b. breve constituted  the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding. other bifidobacterial species such as b. longum, b. adolescentis, b. parabifidum and b. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants. the latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well. it seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning lactobacillus spp. (especially l. fermentum and l. brevis).

TI  == characterization of dairy-related bifidobacterium spp. based on their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns.
AB  == numerical analysis of phenotypic characteristics based on enzymatic activity and  carbohydrate fermentation allowed the discrimination of most strains of bifidobacteria of animal origin from those of human origin. strains of bifidobacteria studied were separated into nine groups based on numerical analysis. three groups contained most strains of animal origin, three groups comprised both strains of animal and human origin, and three groups were strictly composed of strains of human origin. the results indicate that one group of animal origin (group ii) contained all reference strains of bifidobacterium animals and 10 strains isolated from fermented milks or commercial preparations.  although numerical analysis of enzymatic activities and carbohydrate fermentation patterns allowed the differentiation of 'wild' strains of b. animalis and b. longum isolated from commercial preparations, this method failed to confirm the species. in the present study, the determination of electrophoretic patterns of beta-galactosidases resulted in the development of a new technique for the differentiation of bifidobacterium species. several isoenzymes of beta-galactosidase were detected among strains of bifidobacteria. each species had a specific electrophoretic pattern. the detection of beta-galactosidase by electrophoresis is a new tool for distinguishing between dairy- and non-dairy-related bifidobacteria. dairy-related bifidobacteria (b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis and b. longum) as well as b. animalis could be better differentiated from other bifidobacteria by comparison of their beta-galactosidase electrophoretic patterns, rather than by numerical analysis of their phenotypic characteristics.

AB  == the chemical compositions of the cell walls obtained from 8 strains in 5 species  of bifidobacterium were analyzed. these cell walls were shown to be composed of peptidoglycan and polysaccharide moieties. some variations with respect to contents of neutral sugars and content of phosphorus were observed with some cell wall preparations from the same species. the neutral polysaccharides in cell walls of 4 strains of bifidobacterium (b. bifidum yit 4007, b. breve yit 4010, b. infantis yit 4025, and b. longum atcc 15707) were purified and their chemical structures were analyzed. one of these polysaccharides, obtained from b. breve yit 4010, was analyzed in detail by glc, 1h- and 13c-nmr spectroscopic analyses,  methylation, smith degradation and acetolysis, and the results suggested the following structure for the repeating unit of the polysaccharide: (formula: see text).

TI  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  == bifidobacterium, bacteroides, and clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). the bifidobacterium spp. most frequently  isolated from the three groups of infants were b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum. the bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were  b. fragilis and b. vulgatus. the most common clostridium sp. in the three groups  of infants was c. perfringens. the type of milk did not select for species of bifidobacterium, bacteroides, or clostridium, except for clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. the species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.

TI  == species of the bifidobacterium in the feces of infants.
AB  == a total of 907 strains of bifidobacteria isolated from the feces of breast-fed and artificial milk-fed infants were studied. their assignment to known species of the genus bifidobacterium was primarily based on dna homology relationships. the strains were classified as b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium,  b. infantis, b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. the distribution of these species is reported.

TI  == [characteristics of the soluble antigens of bifidobacteria].
AB  == the immunological study of aqueous buffer extracts obtained from 45 strains of bifidobacteria belonging to the species b. bifidum, b. longum, b. adducens, b. breve, b. infantis and b. parvulorum was made. this study revealed 3 levels of the immunological specificity of soluble bifidobacterial proteins: common to the  genus bifidobacterium, common to a limited number of strains belonging to one or  several species of bifidobacteria and strain-specific.
