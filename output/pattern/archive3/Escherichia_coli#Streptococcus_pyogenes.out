short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of citrus sinensis.
antibacterial effect of citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcesnces, shigella flexneri, enterobacter amnigenus, salmonella typhimurium and serratia odorifera. methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. in vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. it was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of e. coli and k. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of c. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of s. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). the potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. the order of antioxidant activity through abts.+ and dpph free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. it was also found that chloroform/methanol (5:5) and butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. these findings reveal the potential use of c. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.
antimicrobial potential of helicanthus elastica (desr.) danser - a less explored  indian mistletoe growing on mango trees.
helicanthus elastica (desr.) danser (loranthaceae) is a less-known medicinally important mistletoe species occurring in india. it is used to check abortion, and also in vesical calculi and kidney affections. there are no detailed studies reporting the antimicrobial potential of this plant. based on the traditional use and the rich phenolic composition of the whole plant, the antimicrobial property of the alcohol extract was analyzed and the results are outlined in the present paper. for the analysis, zone of inhibition, and minimum inhibitory concentration were used, and the total activity was assayed by standard methodologies. the antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria like aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, vibrio fischeri, and a fungus candida albicans. of the eight tested bacteria, the alcoholic extract of h. elastica was found to be active against k. pneumoniae, a. hydrophila, e. coli, and v. fischeri at concentration ranging from 250 to 500 mug/ml. c. albicans showed inhibition only at a concentration of 2000 mug/ml.
effects of natural honey on polymicrobial culture of various human pathogens.
introduction: honey has a wide range of antimicrobial activity. all previous studies have considered honey's effect on a single microbe. the present study investigated activity of honey towards a high dose of single or polymicrobial culture. material and methods: 10 microl specimens of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes), escherichia coli (e. coli) and candida albicans (c. albicans) were cultured in 10 ml of 10-100% (wt/v) honey diluted in broth. six types of polymicrobial microbial cultures were prepared by culturing the isolates with each other onto broth (control) and broth containing various concentrations of honey (10-100% wt/v). microbial growth was assessed on solid plate media after 24 h incubation. results: honey (30-70%) prevents growth of 10 microl specimens of all the isolates. greater reduction in growth of e. coli was observed when cultured with s. aureus. culturing of s. aureus with s. pyogenes, c. albicans, or e. coli increased its sensitivity to honey. s. aureus and s. pyogenes increased sensitivity of c. albicans to honey while e. coli and c. albicans decreased sensitivity of s. pyogenes. conclusions: it might be concluded that honey prevents and inhibits growth of single and polymicrobial pathogenic cultures. polymicrobial culture affects growth of the isolates and increases their sensitivity to honey.
comparative studies on genital infections and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of isolates from camels (camelus dromedarius) and cows (bos indicus) in maiduguri, north-eastern nigeria.
a total of 160 genitalia of camels and cows were investigated in maiduguri, north-eastern nigeria to compare bacterial isolates and the antibacterial susceptibilities of some of the isolates. streptococcus (str.) pyogenes (31%), escherichia (e.) coli (24%) and staphylococcus (s.) aureus (20%) were the most common vaginal bacterial isolates in camels; while e. coli (73%), str. pyogenes (18%) and s. aureus (11%) were the most frequent isolates in the cows. of the 78 uterine isolates recovered in this study, e. coli was the most prominent in camels (8%) and cows (54%). the overall weight of genital infection in all camels and cows examined was highest (p < 0.05) with e. coli (79%), but there was no difference (p > 0.05) between vaginal and uterine bacterial isolates from camels and cows in this study. the relative risk (rr) for an infection of the vagina with e coli (3.04, 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.104 to 4.398, p < 0.0001) is more in cows compared to the camel, but the rr for vaginal infection with s. aureus and str. pyogenes were lower in cows compared to camels. the e. coli and s. aureus isolates were highly susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested. therefore effective management of reproductive disorders associated with these pathogens can be achieved with proper use of these antimicrobial agents in these animal species.
[antibacterial activity for clinical isolates from pediatric patients of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (1: 14) -outcomes of special drug use investigation on antibacterial activity (annual changes)].
as a special drug use investigation, we monitored and assessed trends in antibacterial activity of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (1:14) (hereafter, "cva/ampc (1:14)") and other antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates from pediatric patients with otitis media or respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections. against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis isolated and identified from otorrhea, epipharynx and rhinorrhea of pediatric patients with otitis media, the mic90s of cva/ampc (1:14) in five years between 2006-2010 were 1 microg/ml for s. pneumoniae and 8 microg/ml for h. influenzae and 0.25-0.5microg/ml for m catarrhalis. the changes of mic90s of cva/ampc (1:14) for penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and beta-lactamase non-producing h. influenzae were two times, and no decrease in drug susceptibility was found in the period of the present investigation. in addition, the mic changes of other antimicrobial agents for these three organisms were approximately two to four times as well. against organisms isolated and identified from pus, sputum, pharynx, skin and urine of pediatric patients with respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections, the mic90s of cva/ampc (1:14) in four years between 2008-2011 were 1 microg/ml for s. pneumoniae, < or =0.06microg/ml for penicillin susceptible s. pneumoniae (pssp) without any change, 0.5-1 microg/ml for penicillin intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp) with a twofold change and 1 microg/ml for prsp with no change. the mic90s of cva/ampc (1:14) were 2-8 microg/ml for s. aureus with a fourfold change, 2 microg/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus without any change, 4-8 microg/ml for h. influenzae with a twofold change. against beta-lactamase non-producing h. influenzae, mic90s of cva/ampc (1:14) were 1 microg/ml for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin susceptible (blnas), 8 microg/ml for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant (blnar), showing no change. neither streptococcus pyogenes or klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrated any change and m. catarrhalis and escherichia coli showed twofold changes of mic90s of cva/ampc (1: 14). in the present investigation conducted to monitor annual changes in antibacterial activity intended for pediatric patients with otitis media or other infections, there was no significant change in antibacterial activity of cva/ampc (1: 14).
photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based tio2 nanocomposites after cessation of uv irradiation.
photocatalysis induced by tio2 and uv light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. the present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the cessation of uv irradiation. we show that resin-based composites containing 20% tio2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against the pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post uv. for biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct uv illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.
new non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. world health organization (who) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. in this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. the new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (pca) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (cs) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus (mr s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant s. epidermidis (mdr s. epidermidis), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, candida albicans and three clinical isolates: mr s. aureus, mdr s. epidermidis, and an e. coli strain. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices were evaluated. ethanol 70% v/v, isopropanol 60% v/v, and 4% w/v chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. copper sulphate pentahydrate was very effective against all tested microorganisms: the mic and mbc for cs ranged from 781 mg/l against s. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against e. coli strains and c. albicans. in addition, pca exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae. the combination of cs and pca showed a strong synergistic effect and all fic indices were </=0.500. the combination of cs and pca were more effective than ethanol 70% v/v and isopropanol 60% v/v. in addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. this work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.
in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p = 0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13 days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.
antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
a chitosan dextran-based (cd) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. the microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations. in addition, the time-kill efficacy of cd hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. cd hydrogel was found to be effective against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000 mg/liter. dextran aldehyde (da) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the cd hydrogel with mbc ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. s. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than e. coli. candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to cd hydrogel and da. scanning and transmission electron microscopy of e. coli and s. aureus incubated with cd hydrogel and da alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. motility and chemotaxis tests showed e. coli to be inhibited when incubated with da. the antibacterial activity of cd hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of gram-positive infections.

objective: to screen the antimicrobial potential of three ethnomedicinal plants chassalia curviflora thw. (c. curviflora), cyclea peltata hook. f. & thomson (c. peltata) and euphorbia hirta l (e. hirta) used in folk medicines in aarukani hills kani tribe, tamil nadu, india against human bacterial pathogens. methods: antibacterial efficacy was performed by disc diffusion method against the pathogens viz., escherichia coli (e. coli) (atcc 35218), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) (atcc 6538), salmonella typhi (s. typhi) (mtcc 733), proteus vulgaris (p. vulgaris), proteus mirabilis (p. mirabilis) and streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes) and incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c. results: the maximum degree of antibacterial activity was observed in c. peltata followed by c. curviflora. while e. hirta showed comparatively low degree of antibacterial activity. the methanolic extract of c. peltata showed the antibacterial activity against three pathogens viz., s. pyogenes, p. vulgaris and e. coli with the inhibition zones 12 mm, 10 mm and 9 mm, respectively. hexane extracts of c. peltata also showed the antibacterial activity against two selected pathogens viz., p. vulgaris and p. mirabilis with 15 mm and 12 mm of inhibition zones. all the three different concentrations (0.25, 0.50 & 0.75 mg/ml) of methanolic extract of c. peltata show the inhibitory effect on the three susceptible bacteria s. pyogenes, p. vulgaris and e. coli with the maximum inhibition in the highest concentration (0.75 mg/ml). the methanolic and hexane extracts of c. curviflora exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium each i.e. p. vulgaris and s. typhi with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. the methanolic and hexane extracts of e. hirta exhibited the antibacterial activity against only one bacterium i.e. s. pyogenes with the maximum zone of inhibition 13 and 11 mm respectively. conclusions: the present investigation revealed that the c. curviflora, c. peltata and e. hirta are potentially good source of antibacterial agents and demonstrates the importance of such plants in traditional medicines.
in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the canward 2007-2009 study.
the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. all staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (mic(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/ml and 2 mug/ml, respectively). ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic(90), </= 0.06 mug/ml), staphylococcus epidermidis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml), and enterococcus faecalis (mic(90), </= 1 mug/ml). over 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/ml. ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae. the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (mic(90), 16 mug/ml). the broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
design, synthesis and in vitro evaluation of antitubercular and antimicrobial activity of some novel pyranopyrimidines.
the clinical significance of pyran and pyrimidine condensed systems and the raise in problem of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens has directed us to synthesize pyranopyrimidine derivatives via the reactions of the versatile, 2-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4h-substituted chromene-3-carbonitrile with the appropriate reagents. the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by ir, (1)h nmr, (13)c nmr, mass spectra and elemental analysis. the compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h(37)rv [atcc-27294] and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus [atcc-25923] and streptococcus pyogenes [mtcc-443] as gram-positive, escherichia coli [atcc-25922] and pseudomonas aeruginosa [mtcc-441] as gram-negative bacterial strains and antifungal activity against aspergillus niger [mtcc-282]. several derivatives exhibited pronounced antitubercular and antimicrobial activities.
antimicrobial activity of topical skin pharmaceuticals - an in vitro study.
the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of currently  available topical skin pharmaceuticals against candida albicans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. the agar dilution assay was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration for cream formulations and their active substances. corticosteroid formulations with the antiseptics clioquinol or halquinol were active against all microbes. the hydrogen peroxide formulation was primarily active against staphylococci. clotrimazole, miconazole and econazole showed an effect against staphylococci in addition to their effect on c. albicans. in contrast, terbinafine had no antibacterial effect. fusidic acid was active against staphylococci, with slightly weaker activity against s. pyogenes and no activity against c. albicans or e. coli. in summary, some topical skin pharmaceuticals have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro, clioquinol and halquinol being the most diverse. in limited superficial skin infection topical treatment can be an alternative to systemic antibiotics and should be considered. with the global threat of multi-resistant bacteria there is a need for new, topical, non-resistance-promoting, antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of skin infections.
synthesis of ag/cnt hybrid nanoparticles and fabrication of their nylon-6 polymer nanocomposite fibers for antimicrobial applications.
ag-coated cnts hybrid nanoparticles (ag/cnts) were prepared by ultrasonic irradiation of dimethylformamide (dmf) and silver (i) acetate precursors in the presence of cnts. the morphology of ag/cnts was characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (tem) techniques. the nylon-6 powder and 1 wt% ag/cnts mixture was dispersed uniformly using a noncontact spinning technique. the dried mixture was melted in a single screw extrusion machine and then extruded through an orifice. extruded filaments were later stretched and stabilized by sequentially passing them through a set of tension adjusters and a secondary heater. the nylon-6/ag/cnt hybrid polymer nanocomposite (hpnc) fibers, which were of approximately 80 microm size, were tested for their tensile properties. the failure stress and modulus of the extruded hpnc fibers (doped with 1% ag/cnts) was about 72.19 % and 342.62% higher than the neat extruded nylon-6 fiber, respectively. dsc results indicated an increase in the thermal stability and crystallization for hpnc fibers. the antibacterial activity of the ag-coated cnts, commercial ag, neat nylon-6 and plain cnts were evaluated. ag-coated cnts at 25 microg demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against four common bacterial pathogens as tested by the kirby-bauer assay. the mean diameters of the zones of inhibition were 27.9 +/- 6.72 mm, 19.4 +/- 3.64 mm, 21.9 +/- 4.33 mm, and 24.1 +/- 4.14 mm, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. by comparison, those obtained using the broad spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 37.7 +/- 2.13 mm, 28.6 +/- 4.27 mm, 22.6 +/- 1.27 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.41 mm, respectively, for the same strains. the zones of inhibition obtained for nylon-6 ag-coated cnt powder at 25 microg were also high, ranging from 15.2 to 25.3 mm in contrast to commercial silver or neat nylon-6, which did not inhibit the bacterial strains tested. further, the nylon-6 nanocomposite fibers infused with ag/cnts inhibited bacterial growth by 11-20%. our results suggest that nylon nanocomposite fibers infused with ag-coated cnts have significant antimicrobial activity.
[investigation of bactericidal effect and nitric oxide responses of caco-2 epithelial cells and thp-1 macrophage cells against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli].
epithelial cells and macrophages contribute to innate immune responses by cell to cell interactions and releasing proinflammatory mediators. in this study, we aimed to illuminate the underlying mechanisms of contribution of macrophages and epithelial cells in the struggle against pathogens. therefore, streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli activated caco-2 cells and thp-1 macrophage-like cells were investigated for their bactericidal activities and nitric oxide (no) production when they were alone, in contact with eachother and when their contact was blocked by continuing exposure of soluble mediators. caco-2 epithelial cells and thp-1 macrophage cells were used as effector cells and s. pyogenes or e. coli as target cells and were incubated at an effector cell/target cell ratio of 1/1 in duplication in 24-well plates. after 5 hours incubation, supernatants were collected from each well for growth inhibition assay and were inoculated onto blood agar plates for s. pyogenes and eosin methylene blue agar plates for e. coli. following overnight incubation at 37 degrees c, bactericidal effect rate was calculated by counting the colony forming units. the supernatants were also collected after 5 and 24 hours incubation for measurement of no production by using griess reagent. bactericidal effect of caco-2 cells alone against s. pyogenes and e. coli were found 21.9% and 36.2%, when seperated from thp-1 cells via an insert was 31.8% and 30.5%, and when cell-cell contact was established with thp-1 cells was 24.4% and 55.7%, respectively. bactericidal effect of thp-1 cells alone against s. pyogenes and e. coli was 27.7% and 63.9%, when seperated from caco-2 cells via an insert was %27.5 and 43.6%, and when cell-cell contact was established with caco-2 cells was 24.4% and 55.7%, respectively. as a result, we found that caco-2 epithelial cells and thp-1 macrophage cells had an antibacterial effect against s. pyogenes and e. coli (p < 0.05), and this effect was higher in macrophage cells than epithelial cells. no levels in epithelial and/or macrophage cell culture supernatants collected after exposure to s. pyogenes and e. coli were significantly higher for s. pyogenes at 5 hours incubation and for e. coli at 24 hours incubation (p < 0.05). morever, it can be concluded that macrophages played a more active role than epithelial cells in bactericidal effect and no response. besides, epithelial cells and macrophages activated each other more when they were in contact than when they were alone or when their contact was blocked.
quinine is bactericidal.
objective: to determine the antibacterial properties of quinine dihydrochloride and its mic. material and methods: a quasi-experimental study was conducted at the jinnah postgraduate medical centre, karachi from july 2006 to november 2006. two hundred samples of pus, blood, sputum and ascitic fluid, from hospitalized adult patients from medicine ward (w-7) having different bacterial infections were studied. proforma was filled to document the demographic details. samples were collected from different sites, isolated, identified and checked for antimicrobial susceptibility of quinine dihydrochloride by standard methods. results: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi were inhibited at mic of 125 g/ml. streptococcus pyogenes was inhibited at mic of 31.25 g/ml of quinine dihydrochloride (dilution ranges from 31.25 g/ml to 1000 g/ml). conclusion: the concomitant antimalarial and antibacterial action of quinine dihydrochloride may be beneficial in developing countries adding to cost effectiveness of treatment provided to patients belonging to low socioeconomic group.
analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
intramammary infection (imi), also known as mastitis, is the most frequently occurring and economically the most important infectious disease in dairy cattle. this study provides a validation of the analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time pcr-based assay that identifies 11 major pathogen species or species groups responsible for imi, and a gene coding for staphylococcal beta-lactamase production (penicillin resistance). altogether, 643 culture isolates originating from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed using the assay. the isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in europe and north america. the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the assay was 100% in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). when considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 1 streptococcus salivarius, and 1 streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as streptococcus uberis, and 3 shigella spp. strains were identified as escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99% in strep. uberis and to 99.5% in e. coli. these false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. specificity and sensitivity remained at 100% for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection. in conclusion, the real-time pcr assay shows excellent analytical accuracy and holds much promise for use in routine bovine imi testing programs. this study provides the basis for evaluating the assay's diagnostic performance against the conventional bacterial culture method in clinical field trials using mastitis milk samples.
[nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
we conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral cpfx. results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. the current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout japan to determine susceptibility to cpfx and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between january and june 2005. the results of cpfx in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. the minimum inhibitory concentration of cpfx at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (mic90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. however, the cpfx-susceptibility rate of escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. for morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of cpfx tended to increase with time. the cpfx-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for p. aeruginosa and 67.9% for stenotrophomonas maltophilia. with the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for cpfx, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. these susceptibility rates for cpfx were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. these values generally indicated favorable cpfx susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of cpfx particularly against gram-negative bacteria. further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of e. coli, m. morganii, and p. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
the bicarbonate transporter is essential for bacillus anthracis lethality.
in the pathogenic bacterium bacillus anthracis, virulence requires induced expression of the anthrax toxin and capsule genes. elevated co2/bicarbonate levels, an indicator of the host environment, provide a signal ex vivo to increase expression of virulence factors, but the mechanism underlying induction and its relevance in vivo are unknown. we identified a previously uncharacterized abc transporter (bas2714-12) similar to bicarbonate transporters in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, which is essential to the bicarbonate induction of virulence gene expression. deletion of the genes for the transporter abolished induction of toxin gene expression and strongly decreased the rate of bicarbonate uptake ex vivo, demonstrating that the bas2714-12 locus encodes a bicarbonate abc transporter. the bicarbonate transporter deletion strain was avirulent in the a/j mouse model of infection. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which prevent the interconversion of co2 and bicarbonate, significantly affected toxin expression only in the absence of bicarbonate or the bicarbonate transporter, suggesting that carbonic anhydrase activity is not essential to virulence factor induction and that bicarbonate, and not co2, is the signal essential for virulence induction. the identification of this novel bicarbonate transporter essential to virulence of b. anthracis may be of relevance to other pathogens, such as streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, borrelia burgdorferi, and vibrio cholera that regulate virulence factor expression in response to co2/bicarbonate, and suggests it may be a target for antibacterial intervention.
experiences in prevention and control of antibiotic resistance in slovenia.
during 1991-1999 a significant increase of consumption of macrolides and fluoroquinolones was observed in slovenia,and this was associated with significant increase of resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes to macrolides and escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones, respectively.between 1999 and 2007 the prevalence of s. pneumoniae resistant to erythromycin increased from 3.7% to 16.8% even though the use of macrolides in the same period decreased from 3.81 to 2.43 defined daily doses (ddd) per 1,000 inhabitants and per day. the co-resistance and the spread of resistant clones were the reason for constant increase in macrolide resistance. slovenia is one of the few european countries with decreasing prevalence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in hospital care during the last years. as a result of control measures introduced in 1999,the mrsa prevalence rates decreased from 21.4% in 2000 to 8.3% in 2007.
characterization of streptococcus gordonii prophage ph15: complete genome sequence and functional analysis of phage-encoded integrase and endolysin.
streptococcus gordonii omz1039, isolated from supragingival dental plaque, was found to harbour a prophage, ph15, whose excision could be induced by mitomycin treatment. phage ph15 belongs to the siphoviridae. the complete genome sequence of ph15 was determined. the genome was 39 136 bp in size and contained 61 orfs. the genome of ph15 was most similar in the structural module to the temperate bacteriophages mm1 and phinih1.1 from streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. in strain omz1039, ph15 was found to reside as a prophage in the cysteinyl-trna gene. a plasmid, harbouring the attp site and the integrase gene downstream of a constitutive promoter, was capable of site-specific integration into the genomes of different oral streptococcal species. the phage endolysin was purified after expression in escherichia coli and found to inhibit growth of all s. gordonii strains tested and several different streptococcal species, including the pathogens streptococcus mutans, s. pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae.
beta-defensin antibiotic peptides in the innate immunity of the buffalo: in vivo  and in vitro studies.
beta-defensin antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional biomolecules, which are  a major component of the oxygen-independent microbicidal system of buffalo polymorphonuclear (pmn) cells. they have great potential for use as proteomic biomarkers of host cell responses in the presence of microbial agents. on purifying these peptides by rp-hplc, four defensin peptides were revealed. the results from testing against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, candida albicans, rinderpest virus (rpv) and newcastle disease virus (ndv), showed that the peptides possessed antimicrobial and antiviral activities. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values varied according to the peptide amounts and the exposure time. furthermore, an increase in the levels of these cationic antimicrobial peptides was apparent in milk obtained from natural cases of mastitis, as compared to the levels in normal milk. maldi-tof-based amino acid sequencing confirmed the expression of two beta-defensins (lap and bnbd-2) in mastitis milk. a comparison of peptide sequences revealed that buffalo lap and bnbd-2 share 98.6% and 100% sequence identity, respectively, with those of cattle. in vitro, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bvdv) infection was shown to induce the expression of the beta-defensin gene, as evidenced by the pcr amplification of cdna with specific primers. the determination of the enhanced expression of beta-defensin peptides in mastitis milk and in pmn cells, can be considered as an advanced approach to the assessment of cellular and molecular responses to cell injury. it is hoped that in vitro studies on phagocytes such as pmn cells and other cell lines, will eventually replace the use of animals in elucidating the roles of these cytokines in response to microbe-derived cell damage. it will also be possible to use defensins as biomarkers to correlate failure in host cell defence systems with peptide heterogeneity.
in vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
background: the antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. objective: to investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. methods: the activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. the validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. the inhibition zones of the discs were measured. results: mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on e. coli, whereas they had no effects on p. aeruginosa. lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, s. pyogenes and e. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on e. faecalis and inhibited s. pyogenes only at double doses. it was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. conclusion: in the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
molecular and structural characterization of the pezat chromosomal toxin-antitoxin system of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae.
the chromosomal pezt gene of the gram-positive pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae  encodes a protein that is homologous to the zeta toxin of the streptococcus pyogenes plasmid psm19035-encoded epsilon-zeta toxin-antitoxin system. overexpression of pezt in escherichia coli led to severe growth inhibition from which the bacteria recovered approximately 3 h after induction of expression. the toxicity of pezt was counteracted by peza, which is encoded immediately upstream of pezt and shares weak sequence similarities in the c-terminal region with the epsilon antitoxin. the pezat genes form a bicistronic operon that is co-transcribed from a sigma(70)-like promoter upstream of peza and is negatively autoregulated with peza functioning as a transcriptional repressor and pezt as a co-repressor. both peza and the non-toxic peza(2)pezt(2) protein complex bind to a palindrome sequence that overlaps the promoter. this differs from the epsilon-zeta system in which epsilon functions solely as the antitoxin and transcriptional regulation is carried out by another protein designated omega. results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the toxicity of pezt is dependent on a highly conserved phosphoryltransferase active site and an atp/gtp nucleotide binding site. in the peza(2)pezt(2) complex, peza neutralizes the toxicity of pezt by blocking the nucleotide binding site through steric hindrance.
modification of chicken avian beta-defensin-8 at positively selected amino acid sites enhances specific antimicrobial activity.
antimicrobial peptides (amps), essential components of innate immunity, are found in a range of phylogenetically diverse species and are thought to act by disrupting the membrane integrity of microbes. in this paper, we used evolutionary signatures to identify sites that are most relevant during the functional evolution of these molecules and introduced amino acid substitutions to improve activity. we first demonstrate that the anti-microbial activity of chicken avian beta-defensin-8, previously known as gallinacin-12, can be significantly increased against escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella typhimurium phop- mutant and streptococcus pyogenes through targeted amino acid substitutions, which confer increased peptide charge. however, by increasing the amp charge through amino acid substitutions at sites predicted to be subject to positive selection, antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli was further increased. in contrast, no further increase in activity was observed against the remaining pathogens. this result suggests that charge-increasing modifications confer increased broad-spectrum activity to an amp, whilst positive selection at particular sites is involved in directing the antimicrobial response against specific pathogens. thus, there is potential for the rational design of novel therapeutics based on specifically targeted and modified amps.
synthesis of some novel heterocyclic compounds derived from diflunisal hydrazide  as potential anti-infective and anti-inflammatory agents.
three novel series of 2',4'-difluoro-4-hydroxybiphenyl-3-carboxylic acid derivatives namely 4-substituted-1,2,4-triazoline-3-thiones (4a-g); 2-substituted-1,3,4-thiadiazoles (5a-g) and 2-substituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles (6a-g) have been synthesized. twenty-one of the newly synthesized compounds were tested against various bacteria, fungi, yeast species and virus. in addition, we have replaced the carboxylic acid group of diflunisal with heterocycles and the anti-inflammatory activity of heterocycles reported here. compound (5d) showed activity against escherichia coli a1 and streptococcus pyogenes atcc-176 at a concentration of 31.25 microg/ml, whereas cefepime, the drug used as standard, has been found less active against the bacteria mentioned above. compound (4b) has exhibited activity against aspergillus variecolor and trichophyton rubrum at a concentration of 31.25 and 15.25 microg/ml, whereas amphotericin b, the drug used as standard, has been found less active against the yeast and fungi. the highest antiviral activity was found in the 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivative (5a) having a methyl group at 2nd position against sindbis virus at 9.6 microg/ml. compound (4c) exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory activity (73.03%) whereas diflunisal, the drug used as standard, has been found less active (24.16%). compound (5f) presented similar antinociceptive activity with the standard drug (paw withdrawal latency was 19.21 s compared to that of diflunisal which was 19.14s, in hot plate test).
targeted drug-carrying bacteriophages as antibacterial nanomedicines.
while the resistance of bacteria to traditional antibiotics is a major public health concern, the use of extremely potent antibacterial agents is limited by their lack of selectivity. as in cancer therapy, antibacterial targeted therapy could provide an opportunity to reintroduce toxic substances to the antibacterial arsenal. a desirable targeted antibacterial agent should combine binding specificity, a large drug payload per binding event, and a programmed drug release mechanism. recently, we presented a novel application of filamentous bacteriophages as targeted drug carriers that could partially inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus bacteria. this partial success was due to limitations of drug-loading capacity that resulted from the hydrophobicity of the drug. here we present a novel drug conjugation chemistry which is based on connecting hydrophobic drugs to the phage via aminoglycoside antibiotics that serve as solubility-enhancing branched linkers. this new formulation allowed a significantly larger drug-carrying capacity of the phages, resulting in a drastic improvement in their performance as targeted drug-carrying nanoparticles. as an example for a potential systemic use for potent agents that are limited for topical use, we present antibody-targeted phage nanoparticles that carry a large payload of the hemolytic antibiotic chloramphenicol connected through the aminoglycoside neomycin. we demonstrate complete growth inhibition toward the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and escherichia coli with an improvement in potency by a factor of approximately 20,000 compared to the free drug.
in vitro antibacterial activity of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract.
the rapidly developing resistance of many infectious pathogenic organisms to modern drugs has spurred scientists to search for new sources of antibacterial compounds. one potential candidate, bdle (dialysis at 10 to 12 kda cut-off) and its fractions ("s" and "l" by 3.5 kda cut-off and i, ii, iii, and iv by molecular exclusion chromatography), was evaluated for antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, lysteria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi) using standard antimicrobial assays. a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of bdle and its fractions was determined by agar and broth dilutions methods. only bdle and its "s" fraction had an effect upon all bacteria evaluated (mic ranging from 0.29 to 0.62 u/ml), and the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects (evaluated by mtt assay) were bacterial species-dependent. these results showed a remarkable in vitro antibacterial property of bdle against several pathogenic bacteria.
a novel antimicrobial epoxide isolated from larval galleria mellonella infected by the nematode symbiont, photorhabdus luminescens (enterobacteriaceae).
a novel antimicrobial epoxide, 2-isopropyl-5-(3-phenyl-oxiranyl)-benzene-1,3-diol (1), was identified from larval galleria mellonella infected by a symbiotically associated bacterium-nematode complex (photorhabdus luminescens c9-heterorhabditis megidis 90). its structure was determined with spectroscopic analysis and confirmed by chemical synthesis starting from a known antibiotic, 2-isopropyl-5-(2-phenylethenyl)-benzene-1,3-diol (2). epoxide 1 was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and a drug-resistant, clinical strain of staphylococcus aureus (rn4220) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 6.25-12.5 microg/ml. epoxide 1 was cytotoxic against human cancer cell lines, mcf-7 wt, h460, and jurkat, with gi(50) of 2.14, 0.63, and 0.42 microm, respectively, but was less toxic on normal, mouse splenic lymphocytes with a gi(50) of 45.00 microm.
antibacterial analysis in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate against ocular pathogens.
purpose: to analyze the antimicrobial properties of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (superbonder, loctite, brazil) in vitro in different microorganisms related to corneal infections. methods: we analyzed the following microorganisms: (1) staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant); (2) s. aureus (atcc 25923); (3) coagulase-negative staphylococcus; (4) streptococcus pyogenes; (5) streptococcus pneumoniae; (6) pseudomonas aeruginosa (multiresistant); (7) p. aeruginosa (atcc 27853); (8) escherichia coli (atcc25922); and (9) enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212). one drop of the glue was dropped directly into the nutrient broth. the plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees c and its growth examined after 24 hours. bactericidal activity of the glue was verified by sampling inhibition zones when present. the samples were plated in blood agar an analyzed after 24 and 48 hours. results: the ethyl-cyanoacrylate inhibited the growth of every gram-positive microorganism tested and showed bactericidal effect over 70% for all of them. among the gram-negative microorganisms, only the e. coli and the e. faecalis had its growth inhibited, and the bactericidal effect was 60% and 40%, respectively. conclusion: the ethyl-cyanoacrylate has bacteriostatic and bactericidal action in vitro, mainly against gram-positive microorganisms.
in vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases and their cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes.
isonicotinoylhydrazide schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their co (ii), cu (ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. the brine shrimp bioassay indicated schiff's bases, l3 and l6 and, their cu (ii) and ni (ii) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (ld50 > 1000).
susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. individual dimers displayed equivalent or lowered mic values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. coli, and vre. raised mic values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. in comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against m. tuberculosis. structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower mics against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus. in contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of mics against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of s. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi, shigella dysenteriae, bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
seventy-five years of neonatal sepsis at yale: 1928-2003.
objective: yale-new haven hospital (y-nhh) has maintained the longest running, single-center longitudinal database of neonatal sepsis, started in 1928. the objective of this study was to update this database with review of neonatal sepsis cases at y-nhh to identify longitudinal trends in demographics, pathogens, and outcome. methods: records of infants with positive blood cultures obtained while they were inpatients in the nicu at y-nhh from 1989 to 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. records of infants who were < or =30 days of age, had positive blood cultures, and were hospitalized at y-nhh outside the nicu from the same period were also reviewed, and all findings were compared with 60 years of preexisting data. results: a total of 862 organisms were identified in 755 episodes of sepsis from 647 infants. the percentage of cases of early-onset sepsis decreased and late-onset sepsis increased compared with the previous 10-year study period. a marked increase in cases as a result of commensal species was observed, particularly in preterm infants who had indwelling central vascular catheters, were receiving parenteral nutrition, and required prolonged mechanical ventilation. the overall percentage of sepsis caused by group b streptococcus and escherichia coli decreased. no episodes of sepsis from streptococcus pneumoniae or s pyogenes, common in the early years of the survey, were observed. the sepsis-related mortality rate steadily decreased, from 87% in 1928 to 3% in 2003. conclusions: the demographics, pathogens, and outcome associated with neonatal sepsis continue to change. the increase in late-onset sepsis in preterm infants who required prolonged intensive care indicates that strategies to prevent infection are urgently needed for this population of infants.
effect of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on herd life in two new york state  dairy herds.
the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) (both with and without specific pathogen identification) occurring in different stages of lactation on length of herd life in two new york state dairy farms. the 2,697 cows in the study were followed for one lactation (the first-occurring one on or after 1 october 1999), until it ended because of a new lactation, culling, or end of study (31 march 2001 in one farm; 31 july 2001 in the other). a cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates, in sas((r)), was used to measure, within a lactation, the effect of the first occurrence of cm (without specific pathogen identification) occurring 1--7, 8--66, 67--100, 101--225, or >or=226 days in milk (dim), on how long cows remained in the herd. for the first occurrence of cm due to streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and 'no pathogen isolated', the intervals were before and after the median dim of first occurrence of each pathogen. there were too few cases due to arcanobacterium pyogenes, and 'other pathogens grouped together' to split into intervals, so they were modeled as binary variables, i.e. as they occurred. cm was modeled using time-dependent covariates, to account for its differing effects throughout lactation on culling. other variables controlled for were herd, parity, calving season, and other significant diseases. in the dataset, the lactational incidence risk of the first occurrence of cm was 18.2%; 20.0% of the cows did not survive the lactation that was studied. the overall annual culling percentage for both herds during the study period (including all cows, whether eligible for the study or not) was 35.6%. for cows with cm without pathogen identification, their highest hazard ratio (hr) of culling occurred from 67 to 100 dim. all of the pathogens modeled markedly reduced herd life. on average over the entire lactation, cows with staphylococcus spp. cm had the highest hrs for culling, although there were no significant differences among pathogens (at p=0.0018 (reflecting 28 pairwise comparisons)). for early-occurring (before median dim of first occurrence) s. aureus cm, the daily rate of change of the hr of culling increased over time. the hrs for culling were particularly high for late-occurring (after median dim of first occurrence) e. coli and klebsiella spp. cm early in the interval, but the daily rate of change of the hazard of culling for these two pathogens decreased sharply over time. treating cm as time-dependent therefore allowed us to measure in greater detail, its varying effects (of when it occurred) on herd life.
in-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
a series of new antibacterial and antifungal schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and shigella dysentriae) and four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureous and streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed schiffs' bases. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
biological activities of ginkgo extracts.
the biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide a, ginkgolide b, bilobalide and a commercial ginkgo product (tanakan) was assessed. bioassays consisted of the agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a kirby-bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. no activity against e. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of k. pneumonia, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, s. epidermidis and s. pyogenes. all extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of s. pyogenes. leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide a, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
[antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
we compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (ccl), cefroxadine (cxd), cefdinir (cfdn), cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefteram (cftm), cefcapene (cfpn), and cefditoren (cdtr), against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and esbl-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in kansai medical university hospital between 2002 and 2003. based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above mic (tam) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. in s. pneumoniae strains, the mic(50,80,90) values of cdtr were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. however, the efficacy rate for cdtr calculated based on the pk/pd theory was 58.5%. cftm showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). in h. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of cdtr was most potent, followed by that of cftm and that of cfpn/cfix. the mic90 value of cdtr was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of cftm (0.5 microg/ml). the efficacy rate for cdtr was 100%. this result supports that cdtr frequently eradicates h. influenzae. in e. coli strains, the mic90 values of the above agents, excluding ccl and cxd, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activity of cfix against k. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of cfdn/cpdx and that of cftm. in esbl-producing bacteria, most agents showed an mic90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. in s. agalactiae and s. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory mic values. in methi- cillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa) strains, cfdn and cxd showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. the frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. esbl-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. however, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (pbp) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. in s. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the pk/pd theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the pk/pd theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.
antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters for antimicrobial effects of cefotaxime and amoxicillin in an in vitro kinetic model.
an in vitro kinetic model was used to study the relation between pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) parameters for antimicrobial effect, e.g., the time above mic (t>mic), maximum concentration in serum (c(max)), and area under the concentration-time curve (auc). streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli were exposed to cefotaxime, and the activity of amoxicillin against four strains of streptococcus pneumoniae with different susceptibilities to penicillin was studied. the drug elimination rate varied so that the t>mic ranged from 20 to 100% during 24 h, while the auc and/or the initial concentration (c(max)) were kept constant. for s. pyogenes and e. coli, the maximal antimicrobial effect (e(max)) at 24 h occurred when the antimicrobial concentration exceeded the mic for 50 and 80% of the strains tested, respectively. the penicillin-susceptible pneumococci (mic, 0.03 mg/liter) and the penicillin-intermediate strain (mic, 0.25 mg/liter) showed maximal killing by amoxicillin at a t>mic of 50%. for a strain for which the mic was 2 mg/liter, c(max) needed to be increased to achieve the e(max). under the condition that c(max) was 10 times the mic, e(max) was obtained at a t>mic of 60%, indicating that c(max), in addition to t>mic, may be an important parameter for antimicrobial effect on moderately penicillin-resistant pneumococci. for the strain for which the mic was 4 mg/liter, the reduction of bacteria varied from -0.4 to -3.6 log(10) cfu/ml at a t>mic of 100%, despite an initial antimicrobial concentration of 10 times the mic. our studies have shown that the in vitro kinetic model is a useful complement to animal models for studying the pk-pd relationship for antimicrobial effect of antibiotics.
rho is not essential for viability or virulence in staphylococcus aureus.
we have identified the gene for transcription termination factor rho in staphylococcus aureus. deletion of rho in s. aureus reveals that it is not essential for viability or virulence. we also searched the available bacterial genomic sequences for homologs of rho and found that it is broadly distributed and highly conserved. exceptions include streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, ureaplasma urealyticum, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803, all of which appear not to possess a rho homolog. complementation studies indicate that s. aureus rho possesses the same activity as escherichia coli rho and that the rho inhibitor bicyclomycin is active against s. aureus rho. our results explain the lack of activity of bicyclomycin against many gram-positive bacteria and raise the possibility that the essentiality of rho may be the exception rather than the rule.
in vitro antibacterial activity of fk041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
in vitro antibacterial activity of ljc 11,036, an active metabolite of l-084, a new oral carbapenem antibiotic with potent antipneumococcal activity.
ljc 11,036 is the active metabolite of l-084, a novel oral carbapenem that exhibits potent broad-spectrum activity. antibacterial activities of ljc 11,036 against clinical isolates from respiratory infections, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 52), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 19), haemophilus influenzae (n = 50), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 53), and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 53), and from urinary-tract infections, such as escherichia coli (n = 53) (mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [mic(90)s], 0.1, </=0.006, 0.39, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively), were 2- to 64-fold higher than those of imipenem, cefdinir, and faropenem. moreover, against these bacterial species, except for h. influenzae, the mic(90)s of ljc 11,036 were 4- to 512-fold lower than those of levofloxacin. ljc 11,036 showed bactericidal activity equal or superior to that of imipenem. bactericidal activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) did not vary with the phase of growth. ljc 11,036 had potent activity against various beta-lactamase-producing strains, excluding carbapenemase producers. against renal dehydropeptidase-i, ljc 11,036 was more stable than imipenem. furthermore, ljc 11,036 produced in vitro postantibiotic sub-mic effects against prsp hsc-3 (6.0 h at one-fourth the mic) and h. influenzae lj5 (9.2 h at one-half the mic). ljc 11,036 showed high binding affinities for pbp1a, -1b, -2a/2x, -2b, and -3 of prsp and for pbp1b, -2, -3a, and -3b of h. influenzae.
structure-activity studies of normal and retro pig cecropin-melittin hybrids.
chimeric analogs of cecropin p1 and melittin with normal and retro sequences were synthesized to explore the effect of sequence, amide bond direction (helical dipole), charge, amphipathicity and hydrophobicity on their antibacterial activity and channel-forming ability. when viewed from the opposite end by rotation in the plane 180 degrees retro analogs have the same sequence as the parent with reversed amide bond and helical dipole directions. the expected activities were related to the important structural features and a series of assumptions were made. retro analogs are expected to be inactive if both sequence and amide bond direction make critical contributions to the activity. cp1(1-10)m(2-9) amide, (swlsktakkligavlkvl), showed a broad antibacterial spectrum with high activity against the two gram-negative and three gram-positive bacteria tested. retro-cp1(1-10)m(2-9) was less active compared to its normal peptide. cp1(1-9)m(1-8) and cp1(1-9)m(2-8) amides were found to be active against gram-negative escherichia coli and also gram-positive streptococcus pyogenes, but inactive against the other test organisms. the corresponding retro analogs were inactive against all the five bacteria tested. these results suggest that both sequence and amide bond direction (helix dipole) are important structural requirements for the activity of cp1-m hybrids. acetylation of the n-terminal amine in both normal and retro analogs lowered their activity, indicating the contribution of free amine to the activity. these analogs form ion-conducting channels in lipid bilayers. the action of the peptides may be explained by self-aggregation and formation of ion-conducting pores across bacterial membranes. conformational analysis obtained from cd measurements showed that all analogs form amphipathic alpha-helices in presence of 12-20% hexafluoro isopropanol. the retro cp1(1-10)m(2-9) amide showed higher helicity and is more potent compared to other retro analogs synthesized. these studies show the effect of small sequence modifications on the biological activity of the peptides and on their alpha-helical conformation in hfip, the structure-inducing organic solvent.
isolation, cdna cloning and gene expression of an antibacterial protein from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros.
an antibacterial protein, designated rhinocerosin, was purified to homogeneity from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros immunized with escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal region, a degenerate primer was synthesized and reverse-transcriptase pcr was performed to clone rhinocerosin cdna. as a result, a 279-bp fragment was obtained. the complete nucleotide sequence was determined by sequencing the extended rhinocerosin cdna clone by 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends. the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature portion of rhinocerosin was composed of 72 amino acids without cystein residues and was shown to be rich in glycine (11.1%) and proline (11.1%) residues. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rhinocerosin with those of other antibacterial proteins indicated that it has 77.8% and 44.6% identity with holotricin 2 and coleoptrecin, respectively. rhinocerosin had strong antibacterial activity against e. coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus but not against pseudomonas aeruginosa. results of reverse-transcriptase pcr analysis of gene expression in different tissues indicated that the rhinocerosin gene is strongly expressed in the fat body and the malpighian tubule, and weakly expressed in hemocytes and midgut. in addition, gene expression was inducible by bacteria in the fat body, the malpighian tubule and hemocyte but constitutive expression was observed in the midgut.
differential induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in whole blood by  bacteria: effects of antibiotic treatment.
the in vitro production of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-6, and the il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in whole blood upon stimulation with different bacterial strains was measured to study the possible relationship between disease severity and the cytokine-inducing capacities of these strains. escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteroides fragilis, capnocytophaga canimorsus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes induced the cytokines il-1beta, il-6, and il-1ra. gram-negative bacteria induced significantly higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine production than gram-positive bacteria. these differences were less pronounced for the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-1ra. in addition, blood was stimulated with e. coli killed by different antibiotics to study the effect of the antibiotics on the cytokine-inducing capacity of the bacterial culture. e. coli treated with cefuroxime and gentamicin induced higher levels of il-1beta and il-6 production but levels of il-1ra production similar to that of heat-killed e. coli. in contrast, ciprofloxacin- and imipenem-cilastatin-mediated killing showed a decreased or similar level of induction of cytokine production as compared to that by heat-killed e. coli; polymyxin b decreased the level of production of the cytokines.
in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against recent clinical isolates.
trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) was very active against gram-negative species examined  including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, legionella spp., neisseria spp. and escherichia coli (mic90s < or = 0.03 mg/l). in general trovafloxacin was twice as active as ofloxacin but only half as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative species. trovafloxacin was active against gram-positive organisms, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l). against these organisms activity was eight to 16 times greater for trovafloxacin than for either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. in addition, chlamydia spp., mycoplasma spp. and ureaplasma urealyticum were eight to 16 times more susceptible to trovafloxacin than to either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these in-vitro data show that trovafloxacin is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone with greater activity against clinically important gram-positive species compared with ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone.
the in vitro and in vivo activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. the in vitro activity of cs-940 against gram-positive bacteria was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. in particular, cs-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the mic at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cs-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. the activity of cs-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. cs-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa, cs-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains tested. against experimental pneumonia with k. pneumoniae in mice, cs-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. these results suggest that cs-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.
[in vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.
toc-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
nk-lysin, a novel effector peptide of cytotoxic t and nk cells. structure and cdna cloning of the porcine form, induction by interleukin 2, antibacterial and antitumour activity.
a 78 residue antimicrobial, basic peptide, nk-lysin, with three intrachain disulfide bonds was purified from pig small intestine and characterized. a corresponding clone was isolated from a porcine bone marrow cdna library. the 780 bp dna sequence had a reading frame of 129 amino acids which corresponded to nk-lysin. the clone was used to show that stimulation with human interleukin-2 induced synthesis of nk-lysin-specific mrna in a lymphocyte fraction enriched for t and nk cells. lower levels of mrna were detected in tissues known to contain t and nk cells, such as small intestine, spleen and colon. interleukin-2 also induced both proliferation of the lymphocyte fraction and cytolytic function in these cells. immunostaining showed that nk-lysin was present in cells positive for cd8, cd2 and cd4. nk-lysin showed high anti-bacterial activity against escherichia coli and bacillus megaterium and moderate activity against acinetobacter calcoaceticus and streptococcus pyogenes. the peptide showed a marked lytic activity against an nk-sensitive mouse tumour cell line, yac-1, but it did not lyse red blood cells. the amino acid sequence of nk-lysin exhibits 33% identity with a putative human preproprotein, nkg5, of unknown function but derived from a cdna clone of activated nk cells. we suggest that nk-lysin is a new effector molecule of cytotoxic t and nk cells.
[bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of sy5555 dry syrup in the pediatric field].
bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on sy5555 dry syrup (powder which is dissolved before use), a new penem antibiotic for oral use, were performed. the following results were obtained. 1. antibacterial activities. mics of sy5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (cva/ampc), cefotiam (ctm), cefpodoxime (cpdx), cefaclor (ccl) and cefdinir (cfdn) were determined against clinically isolated staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae at a dose of 10(6) cfu/ml. mics of sy5555 against s. aureus, cns, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, e. coli and e. cloacae were 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, < or = 0.025, 0.78, 0.2, 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing excellent antibacterial effects on these pathogens. although the effects of sy 5555 against h. influenzae and e. coli were slightly inferior to those of cpdx and cfdn, the drug showed the most excellent antibacterial effect on other strains as compared with the control drugs. 2. absorption and excretion in this study, plasma concentrations and urinary recovery rates were examined after administration of sy5555 at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg (potency) after meals. with both 5 and 10 mg/kg doses, peak plasma concentrations were reached 1 hour after administration, at 0.25-2.61 micrograms/ml (mean 1.47 micrograms/ml) and 1.08-2.17 micrograms/ml (mean 1.74 micrograms/ml), respectively. the plasma levels rapidly decreased to 0.06-0.19 micrograms/ml (0.12 micrograms/ml) and 0.0503-0.0637 micrograms/ml) after 6 hours. the half-lives 1.12 hours in the 5 mg/kg group and 1.0 hour in the 10 mg/kg group. the urinary recovery rates were determined in the first 8 hours after administration in the 5 mg/kg and 6 hours in the 10 mg/kg group, and the values were as low as 1.05-12.3% and 1.6-4.33%, respectively. 3. clinical results the clinical responses were examined in a total of 73 cases including 4 acute pneumonia, 13 acute bronchitis, 11 tonsillitis, 3 pharyngitis, 12 scarlet fever, 2 pertussis, 6 urinary tract infection, 6 otitis media, 7 lymphadenitis, 2 staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, 2 phlegmon, 4 impetigo and 1 purulent parotitis. the treatment was effective or better in 66 of 70 cases with an efficacy rate of 94.3% (3 undeterminable cases were excluded). bacteriological effects were examined during the clinical course for detected or suspected pathogens found before administration of sy5555. the effects were determined in 50 cases including 7 cases of polymicrobacterial infections, 57 strains in total. eight strains, however, persisted, hence the overall eradication rate was 86.0%.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
[antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
to examine the antimicrobial activity of cefditoren (cdtr) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients at this hospital from november, 1993 to february, 1994, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined including those of the control drugs. the results were as follows: 1. cdtr showed strong antimicrobial activities against staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics of cdtr against benzylpenicillin-insensitive or -resistant s. pneumoniae distributed in the lowest concentration range even compared to those of the control drugs. 2. cdtr showed strong antimicrobial activities against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, and klebsiella spp. the mic of cdtr against ceps-resistant e. coli was lower than those of most control drugs. 3. since the microbes described above the major pathogens for the community-acquired infections, cdtr will be effective against infectious diseases transmitted at outpatient visits.
in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c. diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
antimicrobial activity of bark extracts of bridelia ferruginea (euphorbiaceae).
water and ethanol extracts of bridelia ferruginea were examined for phytochemical and antimicrobial properties. the extracts, which were tested at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml, produced in vitro antimicrobial activities in assays against hospital strains of staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, streptococcus lactis, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes and klebsiella sp. the zones of inhibition produced by the extracts in agar diffusion assays against the test micro-organisms ranged from 4 to 20 mm, while the chloramphenicol antibiotic control produced zones that measured 15-36 mm. preliminary phytochemical analysis of the plant extracts showed the presence of phenols and tannins. sesquiterpenes, anthroquinones, and saponins were not detected in the extracts. the gram-negative bacteria appeared to be more susceptible (4-20 mm) to the antimicrobial effect of the extracts than the gram-positive organisms (4-18 mm).
in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.
antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of escherichia coli (98 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), enterococcus spp. (45 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), streptococcus pyogenes (group a; 19 strains) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b; 36 strains). cefepime showed excellent activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. the in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter spp. and p. aeruginosa. against h. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. all 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. this in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
identification of a fibronectin-binding protein as adhesin of streptococcus pyogenes.
the role of streptococcal fibronectin-binding protein (sfb protein) in the adherence of streptococcus pyogenes to epithelial cells was analyzed by using a recombinant sfb fusion protein which was constructed by fusion of the binding domain of sfb protein to ms2 polymerase. sfb fusion protein was overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified from e. coli lysates by fplc and analysed in binding experiments with 125i-labelled fibronectin and adherence studies with hep2 epithelial cells. lysates from e. coli expressing the fusion protein as well as purified sfb protein competitively inhibited fibronectin binding and epithelial cell adherence of s. pyogenes, whereas streptococcal lipoteichoic acid (lta), previously suggested to be the adhesin of s. pyogenes, had no effects. southern blot analysis of chromosomal dna from various streptococci revealed that the gene coding for the binding domain of sfb protein was also present in other s. pyogenes strains. these results indicate that fibronectin-binding protein is the major adhesin of s. pyogenes.
comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
an agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and haemophilus influenzae with an mic90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and legionella pneumophila with an mic of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin inhibited staphylococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (mic90) against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and some other gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. the results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against gram-negative and gram-positive species.
[laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil in the field of pediatrics].
laboratory and clinical studies on cefprozil (cfpz, bmy-28100), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and urinary recovery rates of cfpz were determined upon oral administration of cfpz after meal at doses of 4 mg/kg granules in a case, 7.5 mg/kg granules in 2 cases and 15 mg/kg granules in one. peak serum levels of cfpz were obtained at an hour in 3 cases and at 2 hours in 1 case after administration of the drug with a range of 2.7-8.6 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 0.69-0.95 hours. urinary recovery rates in the first 6 hours after administration ranged from 59.4-71.3%. 2. mics of cfpz against 36 clinical isolates (staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, streptococcus pneumoniae 5, streptococcus pyogenes 5, escherichia coli 5, haemophilus influenzae 12, haemophilus parainfluenzae 4, and branhamella catarrhalis 1) were compared with those of cefaclor (ccl) and ampicillin (abpc). the antibacterial activity of cfpz was superior to those of ccl against gram-positive cocci, and to those of abpc against e. coli, and was equal to those of ccl and inferior to those of abpc against h. influenzae. 3. thirty-seven pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases (pharyngitis/tonsillitis 17, bronchitis 7, pneumonia 3, skin and soft tissue infection 2, and urinary tract infection 8) were treated with cfpz at daily doses of 10-47 mg/kg t.i.d. as a rule. the efficacy rates were 100% clinically and 56% bacteriologically. 4. side effects or abnormal laboratory test values were not observed except for an increased platelet count in 1 case and elevated got, gpt values in 2 cases.
[clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (cfpz, bmy-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. cfpz was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute uti, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. the effectiveness rate was 96.4%. bacteriologically, 4 strains of staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-streptococcus, 1 strain of klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of salmonella c2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. the bacteriological eradication rates for gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against gram-positive bacteria. no side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. as abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. in conclusion, cfpz was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
in vitro activity of mc-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
the in vitro activity of mc-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-o-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. the mc-352 mic90 (mic for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. the mc-352 mic50 for erythromycin-resistant s. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. the mc-352 mic90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the mc-352 mic90 for group b, c, and g streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. mc-352 and clarithromycin had an mic90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae. erythromycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by mc-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the mic for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. mc-352 was the most active agent against bacteroides fragilis, with an mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against haemophilus influenzae, with an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. moraxella spp. were inhibited by mc-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. the mic90 for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella, shigella, yersinia, enterobacter, citrobacter, and serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mc-352 was bactericidal for s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ljc 10,627.
the in vitro activity of ljc 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. ljc 10,627 inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, proteus rettgeri, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. ljc 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter, and serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than ljc 10,627 against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. ljc 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis strains. ljc 10,627 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of ljc 10,627 per ml. serum (50%) did not affect the mics. ljc 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of bush types 2b, 2b', tem-1, tem-2, tem-3, tem-5, tem-7, tem-9, and shv-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of bush type 1; p-99; a morganella enzyme; or a citrobacter freundii enzyme. the bush type 2c and 2d enzymes oxa-1, oxa-2, pse-1, pse-2, and pse-4 did not hydrolyze ljc 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, moraxella spp., bacteroides fragilis, and proteus vulgaris. the beta-lactamase of xanthomonas hydrolyzed ljc 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
in vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, mic90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. however, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, mic greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the mics were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for bacteroides spp. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the mics of cefixime. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were resistant. cefcanel was hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-3 and moraxella bro-1 beta-lactamases. escherichia coli containing tem-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel mics of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited haemophilus influenzae carrying tem-1.
synthesis of cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes of ceclor (cefaclor) and preliminary experiments on their antibacterial character.
cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii) complexes of the antibacterial drug ceclor have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of their elemental analysis, molar conductance, magnetic moment and electronic and infrared spectral data. these complex have been, then subjected to screening for their antibacterial properties against bacterial species such as streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. in comparison to uncomplexed ceclor, the metal complexes have been shown to be more antibacterial.
in vitro and in vivo evaluation of ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and streptococcus pyogenes, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with mic90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. serratia marcescens was less susceptible to ro 09-1428, with a mic90 of 25 micrograms/ml. the most distinctive feature of ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with mic90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and c. freundii were inhibited by ro 09-1428, while those of s. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. pbp 3 was the most sensitive target in e. coli and p. aeruginosa. the response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. in accordance with its in vitro activity, ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. the results indicate that ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against p. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of c. freundii and e. cloacae.
[bacteriological and clinical studies of cefodizime in pediatrics].
bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (cdzm, thr-221), a new cephem  developed by hoechst ag and roussel uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. against gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of cdzm were similar to those of cefotaxime (ctx), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia sp., antibacterial activities of cdzm were similar to that of ctx, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. especially against haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). especially s. pneumoniae in 10 cases, h. influenzae in 12 cases and b. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. as digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. in laboratory test values, elevation of got, elevation of gpt, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. no change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. from above results, we have concluded that cdzm is a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.
inability of toxin inhibitors to neutralize enhanced toxicity caused by bacteria  adherent to tissue culture cells.
toxicity to y-1 adrenal mouse cells caused by heat-labile toxin secreted by an enterotoxigenic strain of escherichia coli (h-10407-p) was 40-fold enhanced in mixtures containing organisms capable of adhering to the y-1 cells compared with monolayers exposed to organisms whose adherence was inhibited by mannoside. severalfold the concentrations of anti-heat-labile toxin antibodies required to neutralize the toxicity of nonadherent bacteria were unable to neutralize the toxicity caused by adherent bacteria. the cytolytic activity toward tissue culture cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages caused by streptolysin s carried by streptococcus pyogenes was severalfold increased in mixtures containing organisms capable of adhering to the target cells compared with mixtures containing nonadherent bacteria. the ability of trypan blue and rna core to inhibit the cell-bound streptolysin s was determined in tissue culture cells containing adherent streptococci and mixtures of streptococci randomly colliding with erythrocytes. both inhibitors were markedly less effective in neutralizing cytolysis than in their ability to neutralize hemolysis. we conclude that compared with toxins produced by nonadherent bacteria, those produced by bacteria adherent to cells are targeted more efficiently and become relatively inaccessible to neutralization by toxin inhibitors.
[susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones from fusaria.
twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of fusarium solani and f. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited to inhibition of phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.
the phototoxic inhibitory effect and phototoxic killing effect of micro-organisms.
the toxic and phototoxic growth inhibitory and killing effect of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenus gr. a, st. viridans, pityrosporum ovale and candida albicans were studied. p. ovale and st. viridans were the only micro-organisms with any toxic effect against the other micro-organisms tested. p. ovale inhibited the growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, ps. aeruginosa and e. coli. st. viridans inhibited the growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, ps. aeruginosa, e. coli, st. pyogenus gr. a and p. ovale. this effect was only growth inhibitory and not direct killing. the activity was increased by uva on s. aureus, s. epidermidis and ps. aeruginosa but not on e. coli and st. pyogenes gr. a. these effects of p. ovale and st. viridans may be of importance in the defense against infections.
in vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
the dual-action antibacterial r 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. it was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (staphylococcus aureus 753, serratia marcescens sm and pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and streptococcus pyogenes. in prophylactic studies, ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against s. pyogenes, but ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against e. coli and more active than fleroxacin against s. pyogenes. in a murine pneumonia model, ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against s. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against klebsiella pneumoniae. fleroxacin was inactive against s. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than ro 23-9424 against k. pneumoniae. in a murine meningitis infection caused by s. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was 3 times as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. when meningitis was induced by k. pneumoniae, ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. in a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against p. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. in the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.
comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk482, a new oral cephalosporin.
fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
[clinical studies of cefteram pivoxil in pediatrics].
the clinical efficacy and the safety of cefteram pivoxil granule (cftm-pi, t-2588), a newly prepared drug for pediatric use, were performed. a total of 60 patients with ages between 6 months and 14 years 3 months with pediatric infections were medicated with cftm-pi at dose levels of 3.2-9.9 mg/kg 3 times daily for 3-11 days. clinical responses to the drug were excellent in 3 of 3 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 14, good in 5 and poor in 2 of 21 patients with acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 1 and good in 2 of 3 patients with acute bronchitis, excellent in 16 and good in 8 of 24 patients with acute pneumonia, excellent in 3 and good in 1 of 4 patients with acute urinary tract infection and excellent in 2 of 2 patients with acute purulent lymphadenitis, hence the overall clinical efficacy rate was 96.5% in a total of 57 patients. bacteriological responses to the drug were as follows: eradicated, 8 strains of streptococcus pyogenes, 3 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, 19 strains of haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive; 7, beta-lactamase negative; 12), 1 strain of haemophilus parainfluenzae (beta-lactamase positive) and 4 strains of escherichia coli (beta-lactamase positive; 1, beta-lactamase negative; 3), decreased, 1 strain of s. pyogenes, hence the eradication rate was 97.2%. no side effects were encountered in any of the patients but for 3 who had diarrhoea and 1 who had loose stool, though these changes were slight. as abnormal laboratory test data, elevation of got was noted in 1 case, thrombocytosis and elevation of gpt in another. also, none of the patients refused or complained of difficulty in intaking of the drug via oral route. in conclusion, cftm-pi appeared to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic against pediatric infections.
[antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (cftm) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. antibacterial activities of cftm against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (ccl). 2. activities of cefixime (cfix) were superior to those of cftm against b. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to cftm against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus aureus. 3. activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of ccl against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and s. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to cftm and cfix against most of gram-negative rods. 4. sultamicillin (sbtpc) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its mics did not exceed the mics of ampicillin by itself. sbtpc showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
[antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. the combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (cmz) was also investigated. obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activity of cmz against 1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of b. subtilis tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activities of cmz against 1 strain of s. pyogenes and 3 strains of b. subtilis. the tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, m. luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against b. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
activity of fce 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.
[antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus].
the antibacterial activity of human cervical mucus in non pregnant or pregnant women were investigated employing the standard blood agar plates. antibacterial activity of lysozyme and combined effect of lysozyme with cefmetazole (cmz) were also investigated. the results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. cervical mucus had an antibacterial activity against bacillus subtilis, but had no antibacterial activity to any other organisms tested. when cervical mucus was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was lost. 2. antibacterial activity of cervical mucus combined with cmz were obtained against streptococcus pyogenes only, and no effect was observed against other organisms. 3. lysozyme had an antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, b. subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, but when combined with cmz no antibacterial activity was observed.
in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ly163892.
ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm, vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
host-vector system for integration of recombinant dna into chromosomes of transformable and nontransformable streptococci.
we describe a genetic system in which transformation of streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant dna into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetm) 6001 (omega 6001). the element containing the recombinant dna was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. when escherichia coli plasmid pdp36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous dna into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous dna caused inactivation of the tetm gene of omega 6001. by analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous dna was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. it was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of s. pneumoniae, s. sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus faecalis. the omega 6001-pdp36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in streptococci. by this method cloned streptococcal dna (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.
a-61827 (a-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
a-61827 (a-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of a-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the mics of a-61827 for 90% of strains (mic90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. the mic90s of a-61827 for members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than a-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of a-61827 per ml. the mic90 of a-61827 for legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. a-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. the mic90 of a-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. in mouse protection tests, a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse bacteroides fragilis abscess model. after oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of a-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
expression of the human interferon-alpha 1 gene under transcriptional and translational control of the spea gene.
the human gene for mature interferon-alpha 1 (ifn-alpha 1) was inserted in a new  transcription-translation fusion vector system based on the expression and secretion signals of the gene for type a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin, spea. as deduced from the known nucleotide sequences of the component elements, the encoded ifn-alpha 1 was a fusion protein carrying an n-terminal extension of 17 amino acids. when inserted in appropriate vectors capable of replication in escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus sanguis, this expression configuration directed the synthesis of antiviral activity in all 3 organisms, as judged by the cythopathic effect inhibition assay of vesicular stomatitis virus. in e. coli jm101, ifn activity was found mainly in the cytoplasmic protein fraction whereas in the gram-positive hosts, it was completely secreted into the culture medium.
in vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. it  inhibits the majority, 90%, of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. it inhibits 90% of the other members of the enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii, cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, listeria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. in general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for adherence of bacteria to animal cells.
epithelial cells scraped from human oral mucosa and from pig intestines were immobilized onto the flat bottom surfaces of microtiter plates to study the adherence of various bacterial species to host cells. bacterial adherence was quantitated either by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique with specific antibacterial serum as the first antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated second antibody or by using biotinylated bacteria and avidin-peroxidase as the detecting agent. unlabeled escherichia coli and purified e. coli 987p fimbriae inhibited the adherence of biotinylated e. coli to immobilized enterocytes. the adherence of a mannose-sensitive strain of e. coli to immobilized oral epithelial cells was inhibited by mannose derivatives. the adherence of fimbriated e. coli 987p to immobilized enterocytes was approximately four times higher than the adherence of a nonfimbriated variant of the same strain. the adherence of streptococcus pyogenes to oral cells was detected in the range of 10 to 150 bacteria per cell and was inhibited by lipoteichoic acid and albumin. the data suggest that the putative receptors which bind bacteria on the immobilized cells retain a functional form similar to that of native cells in suspension. the proposed adherence assay is easy to perform, allows the detection of specific adherence of test bacteria, and provides objective quantitation of adherence with a sensitivity of 10 bacteria per cell. most importantly, the assay allows the testing of many variables in the same day.
[reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.
[distribution and changes in the susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical samples. ii].
in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents such as abpc, sbpc, mpc, cez, ctm, cmz, ctx, cmx, czx, lmox, cpz, cfs and gm against major clinical isolates, s. aureus, s. pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, c. freundii, enterobacter spp., s. marcescens, p. vulgaris and p. aeruginosa, was examined. in this paper, we will report the susceptibility of s. aureus, s. pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis during a three-year period, 1981 to approximately 1983. cez- and gm-resistant s. aureus has markedly increased and occupied 24% and 18%, respectively, in 1983. cmz and cfs have showed potent activity against cez-resistant s. aureus. it seems that the abuse of third generation-cephems and new oral cephalosporins is closely related with the increase of cephems-resistant s. aureus. the penicillin- and cephem-resistant strains of s. pyogenes could not be found in our study. quite a few strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis are resistant to penicillins, and also there is no appreciable change in susceptibility. some strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis showed low susceptibility to cpz, but all strains showed high susceptibility and no change in susceptibility to third generations, and these strains showed no tendency to decrease in susceptibility to gm.
wide-spectrum antibiotic activity of bovine granulocyte polypeptides.
the antibiotic activity of a polypeptide fraction purified from bovine granulocyte granules was tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, bacillus stearothermophilus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and clinical isolates of staphylococcus and enterobacter spp. all of these bacterial species were susceptible to the antibiotic polypeptide(s), with mics ranging from 3 to 100 micrograms of protein per ml. the antimicrobial activity was resistant to boiling and abolished by proteinase treatment. saccharomyces cerevisiae and human fibroblasts grew normally in the presence of 100 and 50 micrograms of antibiotic polypeptide(s) per ml, respectively. [3h]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, dna was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. this suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial dna.
[clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. observation on the mics and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (cmx) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. cmx was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes and haemophilus influenzae and also streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae with mic values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. against staphylococci and serratia marcescens, cmx showed the antimicrobial activity with mic90 6.25 micrograms/ml. however, cmx was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against streptococcus faecalis. reliability of cmx disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of cmx. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, capable of utilizing cmx disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of cmx. using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms cmx, fuchs et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = mic 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = mic 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. in this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = mic greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = mic greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = mic greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). based on cmx pharmacokinetic data currently available, mic break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
enhancement of endotoxicity and reactivity with carbocyanine dye by sonication of lipopolysaccharide.
the specificity of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, lps) in the carbocyanine dye reaction was investigated, and then a stoichiometric study of the dye-lps interaction was conducted with attention to the relationship of biological activities of lps to the reactivity with the dye. absorption maxima of some bacterial components in the dye reaction were as follows; lps from both escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa and lipid a from e. coli lps, 465 nm; shigella flexneri lps, 460 nm; salmonella minnesota r595 glycolipid, 470 nm; polysaccharide from e. coli lps, 650 nm; yeast rna, 620 nm; streptococcal m protein and pyrogenic exotoxin, 610 nm; and free fatty acids, 445-450 nm. the absorbance at 465 nm was increased approximately threefold by sonicating lps for 1-3 min, which roughly paralleled the decrease in turbidity of the lps aqueous solution. the limulus amoebocyte lysate (lal) gelation activity of lps increased 10-fold when lps was sonicated for 0.5-5 min, but it decreased to the control level after further treatment. this decrease, however, was overcome by sonication in the presence of 5 mmol of l-ascorbic acid used as an antioxidant. the lal gelation activity of lps was inactivated in parallel with an increase in the ratio (w/w) of dye to lps from 1.73 to 6.90 in the dye-lps mixture. pyrogenicity of lps was also clearly inactivated when the ratio was over 1.73. the ratios of the height of the beta band at 465 nm (dye-lps complex) to that of the alpha band at 510 nm (free dye) were increased by sonicating lps, indicating that the binding character, or stacking tendency, was increased by sonicating lps.
[susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
cefpiramide (cpm, sm-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. antibacterial activities of cpm against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis and proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (cpz). antibacterial activities of cpm against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of cpz, but antibacterial activity of cpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of cpz and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. antibacterial activity of cpm has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (pcase type) producing s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, etc. it is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of cpm against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of cpm.
antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365).
the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365 or a-50912), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with those of cefazolin, cefoxitin, and cefamandole against a broad spectrum of 486 organisms and with that of cefotaxime against 114 organisms. cefmenoxime and cefotaxime exhibited nearly equivalent activities against those organisms tested and were the most active of these cephalosporins against all aerobic and facultative organisms except staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefmenoxime required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (mic(90)) ranged from 0.06 to 8 mug/ml for the enterobacteriaceae. the mic(90)s for gram-positive cocci were 0.015 and </=0.008 mug/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively, and 2 mug/ml for s. aureus. group d streptococci were less susceptible. cefmenoxime was very active against haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and neisseria meningitidis with mic(90)s ranging from </=0.008 to 0.25 mug/ml. cefmenoxime, at a concentration of 16 mug/ml, inhibited 78% and 73% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp., respectively. mics for anaerobes ranged from 0.5 to >128 mug/ml with good activity against the gram-positive organisms. in addition, cefmenoxime activity was bactericidal and only slightly affected by differences in inoculum size. the combination of cefmenoxime and gentamicin was synergistic against 80% of the enterobacteriaceae and 100% of p. aeruginosa strains tested. development of resistance to cefmenoxime was slow or absent for organisms with low initial mics but more rapid for those with higher initial mics. cefmenoxime exhibited good protective activity in mice infected with escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, or s. aureus but was less effective against p. aeruginosa.
[studies on the antimicrobial effect of vitamin d (author's transl)].
in in vitro studies vitamin d3 proved inhibitory on strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae. escherichia coli, and candida albicans. in the presence of 5x10(4)-9x10(4) iu/ml vitamin d3 the organisms were killed or reacted with a marked growth inhibition.
in vitro activity of sisomicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, against clinical isolates.
sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. with the exception of serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and klebsiella spp. it was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.
inhibition of bacterial growth by beta-chloro-d-alanine.
the d- and l-isomers of beta-chloroalanine inhibit the growth of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. with pneumococcus the inhibition by beta-chloro-d-alanine is completely prevented by either d-alanine or d-alanyl-d-alanine, while l-alanine is not effective in preventing the inhibition. the inhibition of growth by beta-chloro-l-alanine is not affected by d-alanine and is only partially prevented by high concentrations of l-alanine. the intracellular free alanine in untreated e. coli and b. subtilis is about 95% in the d-configuration while the free intracellular alanine in both organisms after treatment with beta-chloro-d-alanine is predominantly the l-isomer. these results suggested that the beta-chloroamino acid inactivates alanine racemase (ec 5.1.1.1). indeed, when extracts of e. coli or b. subtilis were treated with beta-chloro-d-alanine, the activities of alanine racemase and of d-glutamate-d-alanine transaminase were found to be 90-95% inhibited. studies with mice have shown that beta-chloro-d-alanine is an effective antibacterial agent in vivo againt d. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and e. coli.
microbiological properties of a new cephalosporin, bl-s 339: 7-(phenylacetimidoyl-aminoacetamido)-3-(2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-ylthiomethyl) ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid.
bl-s 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature of the assay medium. when assayed in nutrient agar, bl-s 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, and indole-positive proteus sp. however, when assayed in mueller-hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. the in vivo activity of bl-s 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. when bl-s 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. bl-s 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. recovery of bl-s 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.
combined effects of diphenyliodonium chloride, pine oils, and mustard oil soaps on certain microorganisms.
bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities of an emulsion containing 10.0% (v/v)  terpineol, 0.5% (w/v) diphenyliodonium chloride, 11.0% (v/v) ethyl alcohol, and 5.62% saponified mustard oil were tested against a number of different types of organisms. the bactericidal concentration for salmonella typhosa was 1:400. in the presence of 5.0% horse serum, it increased to 1:250. the bacteriostatic concentration varied from organism to organism; escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus required 4,000 mug/ml for complete bacteriostasis, whereas corynebacterium diphtheriae, salmonella paratyphi-a, and shigella required only 2,000 mug/ml for complete inhibition. a 4.0% concentration of the emulsion killed the spores of bacillus subtilis within 6 hr.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephalexin, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin c antibiotic.
concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.
in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.
inhibition on bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid.
streightoff, frank (the lilly research laboratories, indianapolis, ind.). inhibition of bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid. j. bacteriol. 85:42-48. 1963.-several compounds related to 5-fluoronicotinic acid (5-fna) have been demonstrated to inhibit streptococcus sp. (viridans group), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus plantarum in vitro. the most active compounds were 5-fna and 5-fluoronicotinamide (5-fnam). the growth of streptococcus sp. was inhibited more than 50% by 0.05 mug/ml of 5-fna or 0.5 mug/ml of 5-fnam. the inhibition of streptococcus sp. from 1 part of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 4 and 2 parts of nicotinic acid, respectively. the inhibition of e. coli from 100 parts of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 1 part of nicotinic acid. inhibitions by most other active compounds could be reversed by nicotinic acid. in experiments with mice, eight compounds related to 5-fna had activity against streptococcus pyogenes; 5-fna, 5-fnam, and 5-fluoro-n-dimethylaminomethylnicotinamide protected all mice at 83 mg/kg x two treatments subcutaneously. the action of 200 mg/kg x two treatments of 5-fna was reversed by 20 mg/kg x two treatments of nicotinic acid. the activity of 5-fna was not increased by modifications at the number 3 or 5 positions on the pyridine ring or by any other structural changes.
