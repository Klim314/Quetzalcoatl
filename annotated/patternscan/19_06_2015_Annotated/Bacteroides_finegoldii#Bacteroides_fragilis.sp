TI  == discovery of beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine phosphorylase involved in the metabolism of n-glycans.
AB  == a gene cluster involved in n-glycan metabolism was identified in the genome of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi-5482. this gene cluster encodes a major facilitator superfamily transporter, a starch utilization system-like transporter consisting of a tonb-dependent oligosaccharide transporter and an outer membrane  lipoprotein, four glycoside hydrolases (alpha-mannosidase, beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase, exo-alpha-sialidase, and endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase), and a phosphorylase (bt1033) with unknown function. it was demonstrated that bt1033 catalyzed the reversible phosphorolysis of beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine in a typical sequential bi bi mechanism. these results indicate that bt1033 plays a crucial role as a key enzyme in the n-glycan catabolism where beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine is liberated from n-glycans by sequential glycoside hydrolase-catalyzed reactions, transported into the cell, and intracellularly converted into alpha-d-mannose 1-phosphate and n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. in addition, intestinal anaerobic bacteria such as bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides helcogenes, bacteroides salanitronis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella denticola, prevotella dentalis, prevotella melaninogenica, parabacteroides distasonis, and alistipes finegoldii were also suggested to possess the similar metabolic pathway for n-glycans. a notable feature of the new metabolic pathway for n-glycans is the more efficient use of atp-stored energy, in comparison with the conventional pathway where beta-mannosidase and atp-dependent hexokinase participate, because it is possible to directly phosphorylate the d-mannose residue of beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine to enter glycolysis. this is the first report of a metabolic pathway for n-glycans that includes a phosphorylase. we propose 4-o-beta-d-mannopyranosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine:phosphate alpha-d-mannosyltransferase as the systematic name and beta-1,4-d-mannosyl-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine phosphorylase as the short name for bt1033.

TI  == reclassification of bacteroides putredinis (weinberg et al., 1937) in a new genus alistipes gen. nov., as alistipes putredinis comb. nov., and description of alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., from human sources.
AB  == during studies on the bacteriology of appendicitis in children, we often isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed tissue samples, an unusual bile-resistant pigment-producing strictly anaerobic gram-negative rod. phenotypically this organism resembles members of bacteroides fragilis group of species, as it is resistant to bile and exhibits a special-potency-disk pattern (resistance to vancomycin, kanamycin and colistin) typical for the b. fragilis group. however, the production of brown pigment on media containing haemolysed blood and a cellular fatty acid composition dominated by iso-c15:0, suggests that the organism most closely resembles species of the genus porphyromonas. however, the  unidentified organism differs from porphyromonads by being bile-resistant and by  not producing butyrate as a metabolic end-product. comparative 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism represents a distinct sub-line, associated with but distinct from, the miss-classified species bacteroides putredinis. the clustering of the unidentified bacterium with bacteroides putredinis was statistically significant, but they displayed > 4% sequence divergence with each other. chromosomal dna-dna pairing studies further  confirmed the separateness of the unidentified bacterium and bacteroides putredinis. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that bacteroides putredinis and the unidentified bacterium from human sources be  classified in a new genus alistipes, as alistipes putredinis comb. nov. and alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., respectively. the type strain of alistipes finegoldii is ccug 46020(t) (= ahn243(t)).
