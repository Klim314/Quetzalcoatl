TI  - Evaluation of the Versant CT/GC DNA 1.0 assay (kPCR) for the detection of extra-genital Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections.
AB  - Screening for extra-genital Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections is a crucial component for sexually transmitted diseases management, even if at present days no commercial methods have been approved for use on pharyngeal and rectal specimens by the US FDA or have received the conformity CE marking. Here we report the analytical sensitivities of the Versant CT/GC 1.0 assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) on rectal and pharyngeal swabs, and an evaluation about the suitability for this assay with two widely used swab collection devices (E-Swab and eNAT, Copan, Brescia, Italy). The limits of detection for rectal and pharyngeal specimens with the Versant assay were 10 copies/ml and 1.0 copies/ml, for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, respectively. False positive results due to the presence of non-gonococcal Neisseria species were excluded when clinical rectal and pharyngeal samples containing organisms identified as N. meningitidis, N. sicca, N. flavescens and N. subflava were tested. Due to its sensitivity and specificity, the Versant assay represents a good choice for the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal infections not only in genito-urinary samples, but also on rectal and pharyngeal swabs.
TI  - Necrotizing pneumonia and empyema caused by Neisseria flavescens infection.
AB  - Neisseria flavescens is an uncommon pathogen of human infection, pneumonia and empyema caused by N. flavescens is rarely reported. Herein, we report a 56-year-old diabetic patient presenting necrotising pneumonia and empyema due to N. flavescens infection. The main clinical manifestation of this patient was high fever, sticky pus and gradually aggravating dyspnea. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed there are mass of high density areas around hilus of the left lung, hollow sign with inflammation also appeared. A biopsy specimen was taken from the left principal bronchus by lung puncture biopsy and showed necrosis and inflammation. Microscopic examination of direct smear and culture of sticky pus, much more gram-negative diplococcus was present, pathogen was further identified by Vitek NH card, Vitek MS and confirmed as N. flavescens by 16S rRNA gene sequencing finally. Anti-infection therapy following the antimicrobial susceptibility test results was effectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pulmonary infection caused by N. flavescens.
TI  - Genome sequence analyses show that Neisseria oralis is the same species as 'Neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis'.
AB  - Phylogenies generated from whole genome sequence (WGS) data provide definitive means of bacterial isolate characterization for typing and taxonomy. The species status of strains recently defined with conventional taxonomic approaches as representing Neisseria oralis was examined by the analysis of sequences derived from WGS data, specifically: (i) 53 Neisseria ribosomal protein subunit (rps) genes (ribosomal multi-locus sequence typing, rMLST); and (ii) 246 Neisseria core genes (core genome MLST, cgMLST). These data were compared with phylogenies derived from 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences, demonstrating that the N. oralis strains were monophyletic with strains described previously as representing 'Neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and that this group was of equivalent taxonomic status to other well-described species of the genus Neisseria. Phylogenetic analyses also indicated that Neisseria sicca and Neisseria macacae should be considered the same species as Neisseria mucosa and that Neisseria flavescens should be considered the same species as Neisseria subflava. Analyses using rMLST showed that some strains currently defined as belonging to the genus Neisseria were more closely related to species belonging to other genera within the family; however, whole genome analysis of a more comprehensive selection of strains from within the family Neisseriaceae would be necessary to confirm this. We suggest that strains previously identified as representing 'N. mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and deposited in culture collections should be renamed N. oralis. Finally, one of the strains of N. oralis was able to ferment lactose, due to the presence of beta-galactosidase and lactose permease genes, a characteristic previously thought to be unique to Neisseria lactamica, which therefore cannot be thought of as diagnostic for this species; however, the rMLST and cgMLST analyses confirm that N. oralis is most closely related to N. mucosa.
TI  - Intraspecific 16S rRNA gene diversity among clinical isolates of Neisseria species.
AB  - In the present work, nearly the entire 16S rRNA gene sequences of 46 clinical samples of Neisseria spp. were determined, and the aligned sequences were analyzed to investigate the diversity of 16S rRNA genes in each commensal Neisseria species. Two 16S rRNA types were identified in two Neisseria sicca strains, three 16S rRNA types in five Neisseria macacae strains, fourteen 16S rRNA types in twenty Neisseria flavescens isolates, and fourteen 16S rRNA types in nineteen Neisseria mucosa isolates. The number of nucleotides that were different between 16S rRNA sequences within specie ranged from 1 to 15. We found high intraspecific sequence variation in 16S rRNA genes of Neisseria spp. strains.
TI  - Evidence of an increased pathogenic footprint in the lingual microbiome of untreated HIV infected patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opportunistic oral infections can be found in over 80% of HIV + patients, often causing debilitating lesions that also contribute to deterioration in nutritional health. Although appreciation for the role that the microbiota is likely to play in the initiation and/or enhancement of oral infections has grown considerably in recent years, little is known about the impact of HIV infection on host-microbe interactions within the oral cavity. In the current study, we characterize modulations in the bacterial composition of the lingual microbiome in patients with treated and untreated HIV infection. Bacterial species profiles were elucidated by microarray assay and compared between untreated HIV infected patients, HIV infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, and healthy HIV negative controls. The relationship between clinical parameters (viral burden and CD4+ T cell depletion) and the loss or gain of bacterial species was evaluated in each HIV patient group. RESULTS: In untreated HIV infection, elevated viremia was associated with significantly higher proportions of potentially pathogenic Veillonella, Prevotella, Megasphaera, and Campylobacter species in the lingual microbiome than observed in healthy controls. The upsurge in the prevalence of potential pathogens was juxtaposed by diminished representation of commensal Streptococcus and Veillonella species. Colonization of Neisseria flavescens was lower in the lingual microbiome of HIV infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy than in uninfected controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide novel insights into the potential impact of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy on the community structure of the oral microbiome, and implicate potential mechanisms that may increase the capacity of non-commensal species to gain a stronger foothold.
TI  - Exploring the oral microbiota of children at various developmental stages of their dentition in the relation to their oral health.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An understanding of the relation of commensal microbiota to health is essential in preventing disease. Here we studied the oral microbial composition of children (N = 74, aged 3 - 18 years) in natural transition from their deciduous to a permanent dentition and related the microbial profiles to their oral health status. The microbial composition of saliva was assessed by barcoded pyrosequencing of the V5-V6 hypervariable regions of the 16 S rRNA, as well as by using phylogenetic microarrays. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing reads (126174 reads, 1045 unique sequences) represented 8 phyla and 113 higher taxa in saliva samples. Four phyla--Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria--predominated in all groups. The deciduous dentition harboured a higher proportion of Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobacteria, Moraxellaceae) than Bacteroidetes, while in all other groups Bacteroidetes were at least as abundant as Proteobacteria. Bacteroidetes (mainly genus Prevotella), Veillonellaceae family, Spirochaetes and candidate division TM7 increased with increasing age, reflecting maturation of the microbiome driven by biological changes with age. Microarray analysis enabled further analysis of the individual salivary microbiota. Of 350 microarray probes, 156 gave a positive signal with, on average, 77 (range 48-93) probes per individual sample. A caries-free oral status significantly associated with the higher signal of the probes targeting Porphyromonas catoniae and Neisseria flavescens. CONCLUSIONS: The potential role of P. catoniae and N. flavescens as oral health markers should be assessed in large-scale clinical studies. The combination of both open-ended and targeted molecular approaches provides us with information that will increase our understanding of the interplay between the human host and its microbiome.
TI  - [Characteristics of microflora of laryngeal mucosa in healthy subjects and patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx].
AB  - The authors present data on the occurrence, density, and species composition of microorganisms isolated from pharyngeal mucosa of 40 healthy subjects and 55 patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx. The total density of microbial populations in control subjects was estimated at 2,672+/-614 CFU/ml compared with 17,510+/-1,983 CFU/ml in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx unrelated to malignant neoplastic growth and 19,375+/-2,103 CFU/ml in patients who had experienced surgical intervention for the treatment of malignancy. A total of 312 microbial strains were isolated and identified. Coccal bacteria were the predominant group (streptococci-74 strains, neisseria-72, staphylococci-62, micrococci-12). Collectively, they comprised 70.5% of all isolated strains representing autochthonous microflora. Corynebacteria, moraxellas, and enterobacteria (transitory forms) were rare. The occurrence of neisseria, staphylococci and fungi (genus Candida) in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx was significantly higher than in the healthy subjects. Moreover, the patients developed dysbacteriosis with the predominance of N. flavescens, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. alpha-haemoliticus, and Candida sp. It is concluded that elucidation of the microbial landscape in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx is of importance for planning prevention and management of pyoseptic complications in the course of surgical treatment.
TI  - Biochemical and genomic analysis of the denitrification pathway within the genus  Neisseria.
AB  - Since Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are obligate human pathogens, a comparison with commensal species of the same genus could reveal differences important in pathogenesis. The recent completion of commensal Neisseria genome draft assemblies allowed us to perform a comparison of the genes involved in the catalysis, assembly and regulation of the denitrification pathway, which has been implicated in the virulence of several bacteria. All species contained a highly conserved nitric oxide reductase (NorB) and a nitrite reductase (AniA or NirK) that was highly conserved in the catalytic but divergent in the N-terminal lipid modification and C-terminal glycosylation domains. Only Neisseria mucosa contained a nitrate reductase (Nar), and only Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria subflava, Neisseria flavescens and Neisseria sicca contained a nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) complex. The regulators of the denitrification genes, FNR, NarQP and NsrR, were highly conserved, except for the GAF domain of NarQ. Biochemical examination of laboratory strains revealed that all of the neisserial species tested except N. mucosa had a two- to fourfold lower nitrite reductase activity than N. gonorrhoeae, while N. meningitidis and most of the commensal Neisseria species had a two- to fourfold higher nitric oxide (NO) reductase activity. For N. meningitidis and most of the commensal Neisseria, there was a greater than fourfold reduction in the NO steady-state level in the presence of nitrite as compared with N. gonorrhoeae. All of the species tested generated an NO steady-state level in the presence of an NO donor that was similar to that of N. gonorrhoeae. The greatest difference between the Neisseria species was the lack of a functional Nos system in the pathogenic species N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis.
TI  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae activates the proteinase cathepsin B to mediate the signaling activities of the NLRP3 and ASC-containing inflammasome.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a common sexually transmitted pathogen that significantly impacts female fertility, neonatal health, and transmission of HIV worldwide. N. gonorrhoeae usually causes localized inflammation of the urethra and cervix by inducing production of IL-1beta and other inflammatory cytokines. Several NLR (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat) proteins are implicated in the formation of pro-IL-1beta-processing complexes called inflammasomes in response to pathogens. We demonstrate that NLRP3 (cryopyrin, NALP3) is the primary NLR required for IL-1beta/IL-18 secretion in response to N. gonorrhoeae in monocytes. We also show that N. gonorrhoeae infection promotes NLRP3-dependent monocytic cell death via pyronecrosis, a recently described pathway with morphological features of necrosis, including release of the strong inflammatory mediator HMBG1. Additionally, N. gonorrhoeae activates the cysteine protease cathepsin B as measured by the breakdown of a cathepsin B substrate. Inhibition of cathepsin B shows that this protease is an apical controlling step in the downstream activities of NLRP3 including IL-1beta production, pyronecrosis, and HMGB1 release. Nonpathogenic Neisseria strains (Neisseria cinerea and Neisseria flavescens) do not activate NLRP3 as robustly as N. gonorrhoeae. Conditioned medium from N. gonorrhoeae contains factors capable of initiating the NLRP3-mediated signaling events. Isolated N. gonorrhoeae lipooligosaccharide, a known virulence factor from this bacterium that is elaborated from the bacterium in the form of outer membrane blebs, activates both NLRP3-induced IL-1beta secretion and pyronecrosis. Our findings indicate that activation of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory response pathways is an important venue associated with host response and pathogenesis of N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Analysis of amino acid sequences of penicillin-binding protein 2 in clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefixime of 0.125-0.25 microg/ml and ceftriaxone of 0.031-0.125 microg/ml, were isolated from male urethritis patients in Tokyo, Japan, in 2006. The amino acid sequences of PenA, penicillin-binding protein 2, in these strains were of two types: PenA mosaic and nonmosaic strains. In the PenA mosaic strain, some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in PenA were similar to those of Neisseria perflava/sicca, Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria polysaccharea, and Neisseria meningitidis. In the PenA nonmosaic strain, there was a mutation of Ala-501 to Val in PenA. In addition, we performed homology modeling of PenA wild-type and mosaic strains and compared them. The results of the modeling studies suggested that reduced susceptibility to cephems such as cefixime and ceftriaxone is due to a conformational alteration of the beta-lactam-binding pocket. These results also indicated that the mosaic structures and the above point mutation in PenA make a major contribution to the reduced susceptibility to cephem antibiotics.
TI  - Distribution of transferrin binding protein B gene (tbpB) variants among Neisseria species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transferrin binding protein B (tbpB), an outer membrane lipoprotein,  is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. Two tbpB families have been documented in Neisseria meningitidis: an isotype I tbpB gene of 1.8 kb and an isotype II tbpB gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated ST-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including ST-8, ST-18, ST-32, ST-41/44 as well as N. gonorrhoeae isolates. The origin of the isotype I tbpB gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic Neisseria and the ST-11 clonal complex N. meningitidis isolate FAM18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype I tbpB gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic Neisseria and ST-11 meningococci. As a result, the diversity of the tbpB gene was investigated in a defined collection of Neisseria species. RESULTS: Two families of isotype I tbpB were identified: family A containing conserved genes belonging to ST-11 meningococci, N. polysaccharea and N. lactamica isolates and family B including more diverse isotype I tbpB genes from N. sicca, N. mucosa, N. flava, N. subflava as well as N. cinerea, N. flavescens and N. polysaccharea isolates. Three isotype II tbpB families were identified with: family C containing diverse tbpB genes belonging to N. polysaccharea, N. lactamica, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis isolates, family D including another subset of isotype II tbpB genes from N. lactamica isolates and family E solely composed of N. gonorrhoeae tbpB genes. CONCLUSION: This study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the ST-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic Neisseria with the origin of the isotype I tbpB gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between these two populations.
TI  - Analysis of mutations within multiple genes associated with resistance in a clinical isolate of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced ceftriaxone susceptibility that shows a multidrug-resistant phenotype.
AB  - A Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain with a reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.5 microg/mL) was isolated among 398 clinical isolates obtained from 2000-2001 in Fukuoka City, Japan. The N. gonorrhoeae strain was negative for penicillinase production but it showed multidrug resistance against penicillin (MIC = 8 microg/mL), tetracycline (MIC = 4 microg/mL), azithromycin (MIC = 0.5 microg/mL) and ciprofloxacin (MIC = 16 microg/mL). The molecular mechanisms of the multidrug-resistant phenotype in this strain were analysed. Polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing were performed to identify mutations within the penA, ponA, mtrR, penB, gyrA and parC genes of the gonococcal strain, which thus explain the multidrug-resistant phenotype. The N. gonorrhoeae strain contained a significantly different sequence of the penA gene from that of the ceftriaxone-susceptible strains. Some regions of the transpeptidase domain within this penA gene were closely similar to those found in other Neisseria species such as Neisseria subflava, Neisseria flavescens or Neisseria perflava/sicca. This strain also included a ponA mutation that is associated with high-level resistance to penicillin, mtrR mutations that mediate overexpression of the MtrCDE efflux pump responsible for resistance to hydrophobic agents such as azithromycin, and penB mutations that reduce porin permeability to hydrophilic agents such as tetracycline. Moreover, this strain contained gyrA and parC mutations that confer high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin. These results indicate the emergence of a N. gonorrhoeae strain with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone, which also showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype that can be explained by the presence of multiple loci mutations associated with antibiotic resistance.
TI  - A novel neisserial shuttle plasmid: a useful new tool for meningococcal research.
AB  - We report the identification and nucleotide sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid pMIDG2830 from the Gram-negative bacterium Neisseria flavescens. The largest open reading frame encodes a protein similar to the replication protein, RepA, found in pAB49 from Acinetobacter baumannii and pNI10 from Pseudomonas. Modified by the incorporation of a kanamycin resistance cassette, the plasmid can be stably maintained in Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis, and can be used as a shuttle plasmid in meningococcal research.
TI  - Expression of heterologous antigens in commensal Neisseria spp.: preservation of  conformational epitopes with vaccine potential.
AB  - Commensal neisseriae share with Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) a tendency towards overproduction of the bacterial outer envelope, leading to the formation and release during growth of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). OMVs from both meningococci and commensal neisseriae have shown promise as vaccines to protect against meningococcal disease. We report here the successful expression at high levels of heterologous proteins in commensal neisseriae and the display, in its native conformation, of one meningococcal outer membrane protein vaccine candidate, NspA, in OMVs prepared from such a recombinant Neisseria flavescens strain. These NspA-containing OMVs conferred protection against otherwise lethal intraperitoneal challenge of mice with N. meningitidis serogroup B, and sera raised against them mediated opsonophagocytosis of meningococcal strains expressing this antigen. This development promises to facilitate the design of novel vaccines containing membrane protein antigens that are otherwise difficult to present in native conformation that provide cross-protective efficacy in the prevention of meningococcal disease.
TI  - Functional diversity of three different DsbA proteins from Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - The genome of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strain MC58 contains three genes - nmb0278, nmb0294 and nmb0407 - encoding putative homologues of DsbA, a periplasmic thiol disulphide oxidoreductase protein-folding catalyst of the Dsb protein family. DsbA assists the folding of periplasmic and membrane proteins in diverse organisms. While all three cloned genes complemented the DTT sensitivity of dsbA-null Escherichia coli, they showed different activities in folding specific target proteins in this background. NMB0278 protein was the most active in complementing defects in motility and alkaline phosphatase activity, while NMB0294 was the most active in folding periplasmic MalF. NMB0407 showed the weakest activity in all assays. It is extremely unusual for organisms to contain more than one chromosomal dsbA. Among the members of the genus Neisseria, only the meningococcus carries all three of these genes. Strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea and Neisseria polysaccharea contained only homologues of nmb0278 and nmb0407, while Neisseria flava, Neisseria subflava and Neisseria flavescens carried only nmb0294. It is speculated that the versatility of the meningococcus in surviving in different colonizing and invasive disease settings may be derived in part from an enhanced potential to deploy outer-membrane proteins, a consequence of carrying an extended repertoire of protein-folding catalysts.
TI  - The integration site of the iga gene in commensal Neisseria sp.
AB  - An IgA1 protease is produced by the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, Neisseria species. In this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 and compared to corresponding loci in N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species. In N. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpB and ksgA were found immediately downstream of iga. In addition to comL and comA, a homolog of the Escherichia coli YFII gene was identified upstream of iga. Each gene in the iga region (YFII and comL, comA and iga, and trpB and ksgA) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. The comL/ comA and iga/ trpB pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. These terminators contain the common gonococcal DNA uptake sequence (DUS). A highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in N. gonorrhoeae was also found in N. meningitidis. In Southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal DNAs of the commensal species N. mucosa, N. lactamica, N. flavescens, N. cinerea, N. subflava, N. flava, N. sicca or N. elongata. When N. gonorrhoeae comL and trpB were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. This indicated that commensal Neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between comA and trpB. The region between comA and trpB was therefore amplified by PCR. The fragment obtained from N. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal comA and trpB, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology to any known gonococcal sequence. Our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. N. lactamica, which is more closely related to N. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.
TI  - Serotype distribution, antibiotic susceptibility, and genetic relatedness of Neisseria meningitidis strains recently isolated in Italy.
AB  - The availability of new polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C prompted European National Health authorities to carefully monitor isolate characteristics. In Italy, during 1999-2001, the average incidence was 0.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Serogroup B was predominant and accounted for 75% of the isolates, followed by serogroup C with 24%. Serogroup C was isolated almost twice as frequently in cases of septicemia than in cases of meningitis, and the most common phenotypes were C:2a:P1.5 and C:2b:P1.5. Among serogroup B meningococci, the trend of predominant phenotypes has changed from year to year, with a recent increase in the frequency of B:15:P1.4. Only a few meningococci had decreased susceptibility to penicillin, and, in the penA gene, all of these strains had exogenous DNA blocks deriving from the DNA of commensal Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria cinerea, and Neisseria perflava/sicca. Fluorescent amplified fragment-length polymorphism analysis revealed the nonclonal nature of the strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin.
TI  - Mosaic-like structure of penicillin-binding protein 2 Gene (penA) in clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced susceptibility to cefixime.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (MICs, 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) were isolated from male urethritis patients in Tokyo, Japan, in 2000 and 2001. The resistance to cephems including cefixime and penicillin was transferred to a susceptible recipient, N. gonorrhoeae ATCC 19424, by transformation of the penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (penA) that had been amplified by PCR from a strain with reduced susceptibility to cefixime (MIC, 0.5 micro g/ml). The sequences of penA in the strains with reduced susceptibilities to cefixime were different from those of other susceptible isolates and did not correspond to the reported N. gonorrhoeae penA gene sequences. Some regions in the transpeptidase-encoding domain in this penA gene were similar to those in the penA genes of Neisseria perflava (N. sicca), Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria flavescens, and Neisseria meningitidis. These results showed that a mosaic-like structure in the penA gene conferred reductions in the levels of susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to cephems and penicillin in a manner similar to that found for N. meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae : Detection and Typing by Probe Hybridization, LCR, and PCR.
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae, first described by Neisser in 1879, is a Gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming diplococcus, belonging to the family Neisseriaceae. It is the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. The other pathogenic species is Neisseria meningitidis, to which N. gonorrhoeae is genetically closely related. Although N. meningitidis is not usually considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, it may infect the mucous membranes of the anogenital area of homosexual men (1). The other members of the genus, which include Neisseria lactamic a, Neisseriapolysaccharea, Neisseria cinerea, and Neisseria flavescens, which are related to Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and saccharolytic strains, such as Neisseria subflava, Neisseria sicca, and Neisseria mucosa, which are less genetically related to the aforementioned, are considered to be nonpathogenic, being normal flora of the nasopharyngeal mucous membranes (2).
TI  - The detection of penicillin insensitivity in Neisseria meningitidis by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Strains of penicillin-sensitive and -insensitive Neisseria meningitidis were examined using a range of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers directed at the meningococcal penicillin-binding protein 2 gene. DNA from isolates whose penicillin MIC was <0.2 mg/L yielded a product of the expected size with all the primers, but many amplification patterns were seen with DNA from isolates whose MIC was above this level. All strains whose MIC was >0.25 mg/L failed to produce a product of the expected size with at least one of the primers used. The changes seen in penicillin-insensitive strains were consistent with horizontal gene transfer from Neisseria flavescens in some isolates, although the source for others remains unknown. PCR-based methods for the detection of antibiotic resistance are becoming increasingly important with the expanding use of molecular techniques for bacteriological diagnosis.
TI  - A comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the adk and recA genes of pathogenic  and commensal Neisseria species: evidence for extensive interspecies recombination within adk.
AB  - The sequences of the adenylate kinase gene (adk) and the RecA gene (recA) were determined from the same isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. lactamica, N. polysaccharea, N. cinerea, N. mucosa, N. pharyngis var. flava, N. flavescens, and N. animalis. The patterns of sequence divergence observed at adk and recA were very different. Dendrograms constructed from the recA data using two different algorithms were statistically robust and were congruent with each other and with the relationships between the species previously proposed using other data. In contrast, the dendrograms derived from the adk data were noncogruent with each other, and with those from the recA data, and were statistically poorly supported. These results, along with the uniform distribution of pairwise sequence divergences between the species at adk, suggest there has been a history of interspecies recombination within the adk gene of the human Neisseria species which has obscured the phylogenetic relationships between the species. This view was supported by Sawyer's runs test, and the Index of Association (IA) between codons, which provided significant evidence for interspecies recombination between the adk genes from the human Neisseria species, but no evidence of interspecies recombination between the recA sequences.
TI  - Construction of recombinant neisserial Hsp60 proteins and mapping of antigenic domains.
AB  - Here we report the cloning and expression, in Escherichia coli, of PCR-amplified  DNA encoding the 63-kDa stress-inducible protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains VP1 and PID2, Neisseria meningitidis 2996 and the commensal Neisseria flavescens. DNA sequence analysis revealed in all cases one open reading frame of 541-544 amino acids corresponding to a protein of approximately 57,000 Da. The various neisserial proteins were > 96% identical at the amino acid level and showed extensive homology with proteins belonging to the Hsp60 heat-shock-protein family. We constructed defined glutathione S-transferase fusion polypeptides of the gonococcal Hsp60 homologue to locate antigenic domains on the recombinant protein. Variation in the immunoreactivity of two monoclonal antibodies recognizing a conserved and a neisseria-unique antigenic Hsp60 determinant, respectively, could thus be deduced to result from single amino acid substitutions. Analysis of the antibody response in patients' sera demonstrated reactivity with the same fusion polypeptides in six out of nine sera, indicating that neisserial Hsp60 is expressed during the natural infection and that distinct domains on the protein are immunodominant in vivo.
TI  - A numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of the genus Neisseria.
AB  - A numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of Neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. These fell into four major areas. Areas A, B and C contained species of Neisseria, whereas area D contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with Branhamella, Moraxella and Kingella species. Area A contained N. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), N. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and N. cinerea closely associated), N. polysaccharea, N. elongata subsp, glycolytica and N. lactamica. Area B contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, N. mucosa, N. perflava and N. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. Area C contained several groups from animals, N. animalis, N. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of Neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. Area C also contained N. elongata, N. subflava (with N. flavescens), type strain of Morococcus cerebrosis and the CDC groups M-5 (N. weaveri) and EF-4. Area D contained Branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' N. caviae and N. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' N. ovis, and a group of Moraxella strains. A small group representing Kingella kingae is included in area D. Mean test error was 1.7%.
TI  - Detection of the tetM determinant in Neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  - Three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetM sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the DIG-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Only Probe 3, 5'-GCT CAA CAA TTC TGT TCC AGC-3', was specific for tetM. It hybridized with the tetM-containing 25.2-MDa plasmids from all of the 232 TRNG and the 130 PP/TRNG isolates used in the study. Its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pJ13 plasmid DNA or 10(4) cells. It did not hybridize with the DNA from non-PPNG, CMRNG and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other Neisseria species (N. meningitidis, N. subflava, N. cinerea, N. lactamica, N. sicca, N. mucosa, and N. flavescens), Moraxella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae. Probe 3 also hybridized to DNA of three tetracycline resistant P. magnus (MIC = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetM determinant. Therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for TRNG, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetM determinant.
TI  - Genetic diversity of the iron-binding protein (Fbp) gene of the pathogenic and commensal Neisseria.
AB  - The pathogenic Neisseria and most commensal Neisseria species produce an iron-binding protein (Fbp) when grown under iron-limited conditions. In the current study, we confirmed the presence of Fbp, as well as DNA sequences homologous to the gonococcal fbp, in strains of N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. cinerea, N. lactamica, N. subflava, N. kochii and N. polysaccharea. The fbp genes from these strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, digested with StuI or RsaI, and the restriction patterns examined. The patterns for the gonococcal and meningococcal fbp were virtually identical; however, variations were observed in the fbp sequences of the commensal Neisseria species. N. flavescens, N. mucosa, N. sicca, N. ovis and Branhamella catarrhalis, did not produce Fbp as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with an Fbp specific monoclonal antibody, nor did they hybridize to an fbp-specific DNA probe.
TI  - Interspecies recombination between the penA genes of Neisseria meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species during the emergence of penicillin resistance in N. meningitidis: natural events and laboratory simulation.
AB  - The penicillin-binding protein 2 genes (penA) of penicillin-resistant Neisseria meningitidis have a mosaic structure that has arisen by the introduction of regions from the penA genes of Neisseria flavescens or Neisseria cinerea. Chromosomal DNA from both N. cinerea and N. flavescens could transform a penicillin-susceptible isolate of N. meningitidis to increased resistance to penicillin. With N. flavescens DNA, transformation to resistance was accompanied by the introduction of the N. flavescens penA gene, providing a laboratory demonstration of the interspecies recombinational events that we believe underlie the development of penicillin resistance in many meningococci in nature. Surprisingly, with N. cinerea DNA, the penicillin-resistant transformants did not obtain the N. cinerea penA gene. However, the region of the penA gene derived from N. cinerea in N. meningitidis K196 contained an extra codon (Asp-345A) which was not found in any of the four N. cinerea isolates that we examined and which is known to result in a decrease in the affinity of PBP 2 in gonococci.
TI  - Neisseria weaveri sp. nov., formerly CDC group M-5, a gram-negative bacterium associated with dog bite wounds.
AB  - CDC group M-5 is a rod-shaped, gram-negative, nonmotile bacterium associated with dog bite wounds. DNA-DNA relatedness and biochemical and growth characteristics were studied for 54 strains from the collection at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One typical M-5 strain, 8142, was further studied by 16S rRNA sequencing. DNA from 40 of 53 strains showed 82 to 100% relatedness (hydroxyapatite method) to labeled DNA from strain 8142. The guanine-plus-cytosine (G + C) content in 8 of the 41 highly related M-5 strains was 50.5 to 52 mol%. These 41 strains were oxidase and catalase positive, nonfermentative, nitrite positive, nitrate negative, weakly phenylalanine deaminase positive, aerobic, and alpha-hemolytic (sheep blood). DNA from the 13 remaining strains showed only 7 to 46% DNA relatedness to strain 8142. These 13 non-M-5 strains differed from the M-5 strains in G + C content, growth characteristics, and biochemical profiles. DNA from M-5 strain 8142 was most closely related to DNA from groups EF-4b (47%) and EF-4a (45%). 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed M-5 strain 8142 in the Neisseriaceae cluster of the beta-3 subgroup of the class Proteobacteria. It was most homologous (98.4 to 98.8%) to Neisseria animalis, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria canis, and Neisseria elongata. All data are consistent with M-5 being a new species of Neisseria, for which we propose the name Neisseria weaveri.
TI  - Phylogeny of species in the family Neisseriaceae isolated from human dental plaque and description of Kingella oralis sp. nov [corrected].
AB  - Fourteen human periodontal isolates recovered from a purported Eikenella corrodens-selective medium containing 1 microgram of clindamycin per ml displayed biochemical traits which differed from those described for E. corrodens. These organisms were gram-negative rods which corroded agar. The isolates were oxidase positive and urease, indole, and esculin negative. They differed from E. corrodens in catalase, nitrate reduction, lysine decarboxylase, and ornithine decarboxylase activities. One isolate, strain UB-294, was presumptively identified as Kingella denitrificans. A second isolate, strain UB-204, differed from E. corrodens by being catalase positive and nitrate reduction negative. Twelve isolates, including strain UB-38T (T = type strain), were phenotypically similar to Kingella kingae except that they did not produce acid from maltose and were not beta-hemolytic. Essentially complete (1,480-base) 16S rRNA sequences were determined for strains UB-38T, UB-204, and UB-294 and the type strains of Neisseria animalis, Neisseria canis, Neisseria denitrificans, Neisseria elongata, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria macaca, and Neisseria polysaccharea. These sequences were compared with the previously published sequences of six other species belonging to the family Neisseriaceae. On the basis of the results of the comparative sequence analysis, UB-294 was confirmed as a K. denitrificans strain, UB-204 was identified as a member of a new species which may belong in the genus Eikenella, and UB-38T was identified as a member of a new species of the genus Kingella, for which we propose the name Kingella oralis [corrected]. Since strain UB-204 was the only representative of a new species, it was not named.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, and ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990 against 1640 isolates belonging to 117 bacterial species. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Bay y 3118 was as active as CI-960 and CI-990, up to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin and up to 16-fold more active than sparfloxacin. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) were sensitive to Bay y 3118. With the exception of ciprofloxacin which was less active, the activities of Bay y 3118 and the other comparator compounds were similar against Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genospecies 3 and Acinetobacter strain 84. Bay y 3118 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at concentrations comparable with those of ciprofloxacin. However, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp. were four times more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to ciprofloxacin. All of the agents tested were equally active against Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria and Bordetella spp. Against staphylococci, Bay y 3118 was the most active compound, followed jointly by CI-990, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and tosufloxacin, and then ciprofloxacin. Bay y 3118 remained highly active against Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to ciprofloxacin; the MIC90 (0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold less than that of CI-990 and sparfloxacin, 32-fold less than that of CI-960 and 128-fold less than that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Against haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis, Bay y 3118 was two- to 16-fold more active than the other compounds. It had only moderate activity against Listeria spp., but this was superior to that of all the other compounds tested. Bay y 3118 was also the most active agent overall against anaerobic bacteria, although CI-960 and CI-990 had slightly better activity against Gardnerella vaginalis. It inhibited Mycobacterium spp. other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium flavescens, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium fortuitum) at concentrations < or = 0.06-4 mg/L and was between two- and 128-fold more active than the other compounds against these isolates; the two strains each of Mycobacterium terrae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum were resistant to Bay y 3118. In this study, Bay y 3118 was shown to be the most active and most broad-spectrum of the new quinolone and naphthyridine derivatives.
TI  - Role of interspecies transfer of chromosomal genes in the evolution of penicillin resistance in pathogenic and commensal Neisseria species.
AB  - The two pathogenic species of Neisseria, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, have evolved resistance to penicillin by alterations in chromosomal genes encoding the high molecular weight penicillin-binding proteins, or PBPs. The PBP 2 gene (penA) has been sequenced from over 20 Neisseria isolates, including susceptible and resistant strains of the two pathogenic species, and five human commensal species. The genes from penicillin-susceptible strains of N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae are very uniform, whereas those from penicillin-resistant strains consist of a mosaic of regions resembling those in susceptible strains of the same species, interspersed with regions resembling those in one, or in some cases, two of the commensal species. The mosaic structure is interpreted as having arisen from the horizontal transfer, by genetic transformation, of blocks of DNA, usually of a few hundred base pairs. The commensal species identified as donors in these interspecies recombinational events (N. flavescens and N. cinerea) are intrinsically more resistant to penicillin than typical isolates of the pathogenic species. Transformation has apparently provided N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae with a mechanism by which they can obtain increased resistance to penicillin by replacing their penA genes (or the relevant parts of them) with the penA genes of related species that fortuitously produce forms of PBP 2 that are less susceptible to inhibition by the antibiotic. The ends of the diverged blocks of DNA in the penA genes of different penicillin-resistant strains are located at the same position more often than would be the case if they represent independent crossovers at random points along the gene. Some of these common crossover points may represent common ancestry, but reasons are given for thinking that some may represent independent events occurring at recombinational hotspots.
TI  - IgE antibodies against Neisseria flavescens.
AB  - Bacterial allergy is still a matter of controversy. We sustain that this name should be employed only in the presence of a specific IgE against antigens from bacteria. In 100 atopic patients and 100 healthy controls with Neisseria flavescens in their pharyngeal exudates, we performed type I immediate skin tests with Neisseria flavescens and IgE-RAST throughout 1 year. Positive wheal and flare reactions were elicited in 8 of 100 atopic patients as well as in 3 of 100 nonatopic subjects. IgE-RAST/anti-Neisseria flavescens was found in 6 of the former group and in 1 of the latter. Neither late-phase nor Arthus-like reactions were recorded. Neisseria flavescens is a non-pathogenic commensal of the oropharynx with scarce antigenic properties and seems not to play an important role in these conditions (rhinitis/asthma). Bacterial immunotherapy should be considered only in the presence of specific IgE antibodies with careful selection of the bacteria or their antigens.
TI  - Penicillin-resistant isolates of Neisseria lactamica produce altered forms of penicillin-binding protein 2 that arose by interspecies horizontal gene transfer.
AB  - Isolates of Neisseria lactamica that have increased resistance to penicillin have emerged in recent years. Resistance to penicillin was shown to be due to the production of altered forms of penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP 2) that have reduced affinity for the antibiotic. The sequences of the PBP 2 genes (penA) from two penicillin-resistant isolates were almost identical (less than or equal to 1% sequence divergence) to that of a penicillin-susceptible isolate, except in a 175-bp region where the resistant and susceptible isolates differed by 27%. The nucleotide sequences of these divergent regions were identical (or almost identical) to the sequence of the corresponding region of the penA gene of N. flavescens NCTC 8263. Altered forms of PBP 2 with decreased affinity for penicillin in the two penicillin-resistant isolates of N. lactamica appear, therefore, to have arisen by the replacement of part of the N. lactamica penA gene with the corresponding region from the penA gene of N. flavescens.
TI  - [Septic shock caused by Neisseria flavescens].
AB  
TI  - Unusual pathogens in narcotic-associated endocarditis.
AB  - We report the cases of three adults with a history of intravenous drug abuse who  developed endocarditis caused by Corynebacterium xerosis, Neisseria subflava, and Neisseria flavescens, respectively. No cases of endocarditis caused by C. xerosis or N. flavescens and only one case caused by N. subflava have previously been reported in association with narcotic addiction. The prominent clinical features in all patients included poor response to antibiotic therapy, persistent fever, and major embolic events. Stigmata of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, as manifested by oral candidiasis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and serologic evidence, were present in two of the three patients. At our institution, where Staphylococcus aureus remains the most frequent etiologic agent of narcotic-associated endocarditis, the occurrence of these three cases in a 9-month period is striking. We speculate that infection with human immunodeficiency virus may play a role in the pathogenesis of endocarditis caused by these unusual organisms.
TI  - Recruitment of a penicillin-binding protein gene from Neisseria flavescens during the emergence of penicillin resistance in Neisseria meningitidis.
AB  - Non-beta-lactamase-producing, penicillin-resistant strains of Neisseria meningitidis produce altered forms of penicillin-binding protein 2 that have decreased affinity for penicillin. The sequence of the penicillin-binding protein 2 gene (penA) from a penicillin-resistant strain of N. meningitidis was compared to the sequence of the same gene from penicillin-sensitive strains and from penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The penA genes from penicillin-sensitive strains of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis were 98% identical. The gene from the penicillin-resistant strain of N. meningitidis consisted of regions that were almost identical to the corresponding regions in the penicillin-sensitive strains (less than 0.2% divergence) and two regions that were very different from them (approximately 22% divergence). The two blocks of altered sequence have arisen by the replacement of meningococcal sequences with the corresponding regions from the penA gene of Neisseria flavescens and result in an altered form of penicillin-binding protein 2 that contains 44 amino acid substitutions and 1 amino acid insertion compared to penicillin-binding protein 2 of penicillin-sensitive strains of N. meningitidis. A similar introduction of part of the penA gene of N. flavescens, or a very similar commensal Neisseria species, appears to have occurred independently during the development of altered penA genes in non-beta-lactamase-producing penicillin-resistant strains of N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Infective endocarditis caused by Neisseria flavescens.
AB  - Neisseria flavescens is a rare cause of human disease. This is the first reported case of endocarditis caused by N. flavescens. The organism produced beta-lactamase, and penicillin therapy failed to cure the infection. Therapy with cefotaxime, to which the organism was highly sensitive, led to a complete and uneventful recovery.
TI  - Branhamella catarrhalis: significance in pulmonary infections and bacteriological features.
AB  - A three-month survey revealed 29 patients at our hospital with symptoms of acute  pulmonary infection, from whom Branhamella catarrhalis was isolated from lower respiratory tract specimens, in 18 cases in pure culture. Approximately 2% of all respiratory tract specimens examined during the period yielded growth of B. catarrhalis. All except one patient suffered from chronic pulmonary disease, notably chronic bronchitis. A phenotypic comparison was made between 55 strains of B. catarrhalis, of which 50 were recent isolates from lower respiratory tract specimens, and 23 Neisseria strains representing Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria cinerea, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria mucosa, Neisseria pharyngis, and Neisseria lactamica. The morphology of B. catarrhalis colonies is very characteristic, and when the diagnosis is suspected, testing for the ability to hydrolyze tributyrin may confirm it within hours. Ability to produce deoxyribonuclease is another property which differentiates B. catarrhalis from the Neisseria species. Otherwise, the combination of nitrate reduction and failure to produce acid from glucose, maltose, and sucrose establishes the diagnosis.
TI  - The systematic serology of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: antigens associated with pathogenesis in Neisseria spp. from man.
AB  - Sonicates of eight Neisseria species from man were analysed in a micro-Ouchterlony double-diffusion absorption assay in comparison with a gonococcal reference antiserum-antigen system. Five major gonococcal precipitin zones were identified which comprised genus-, species- and type-specific components. One antigen was found in all strains of three species with pathogenic capability--N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis and N. flavescens. It was not detected in N. lactamica, N. pharyngis, N. elongata, N. cinerea or N. catarrhalis.
TI  - Conjugation of plasmids of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to other Neisseria species: potential reservoirs for the beta-lactamase plasmid.
AB  - The discovery that penicillinase production in Neisseria gonorrhoeae was plasmid  mediated and the spread of the beta-lactamase encoding plasmids in gonococcal isolates since 1976, raise the possibility that a nonpathogenic indigenous bacterium could serve as a reservoir for these plasmids. We initiated studies to define the ability of commensal Neisseria species and Branhamella catarrhalis strains, as well as strains of the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, to serve as recipients in conjugation with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We found that with N. gonorrhoeae as the donor, 3 of 5 Neisseria cinerea, 2 of 5 Neisseria flava, 0 of 1 Neisseria flavescens, 1 of 3 Neisseria subflava, 0 of 6 B. catarrhalis, 0 of 7 Neisseria lactamica, 1 of 5 Neisseria mucosa, 1 of 7 Neisseria perflava/sicca, and 0 of 13 N. meningitidis strains gave detectable conjugation frequencies (greater than 10(-8). N. cinerea was the only species found to maintain the gonococcal conjugal plasmid (pLE2451). A N. cinerea transconjugant containing pLE2451 was observed to transfer both the beta-lactamase plasmid and pLE2451 to N. gonorrhoeae at high frequency.
TI  - Neisseria flavescens septicaemia with meningitis. A case report.
AB  - A rare case of septicaemia with meningitis caused by Neisseria flavescens is reported. The clinical presentation and initial bacteriological findings were indistinguishable from those in meningococcal septicaemia with purpura. A review of the literature for N. flavescens infections revealed 15 other cases of meningitis and 1 of septicaemia. A plea is made for the full identification of all Neisseria isolated, especially those isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and blood cultures, so that closely related members of the family Neisseriaceae are not confused.
TI  - The significance of nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal Neisseria isolates from blood cultures.
AB  - Nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseriae are part of the normal respiratory flora and infrequently cause disease. These organisms include Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria mucosa, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria subflava , Neisseria perflava , Neisseria flava , and Branhamella catarrhalis (previously classified as Neisseria catarrhalis). Blood cultures positive for these bacteria have been associated with serious infections, including endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis. In a retrospective survey of a 10-year period, 1970-1980, eight patients were identified at Hartford Hospital (Hartford, Conn.) whose blood cultures were positive for nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseriae. In four patients, the neisseria blood isolates were associated with serious infections: two with endocarditis, one with sepsis, and one with meningitis. In four other patients, the neisseria blood isolates were contaminants.
TI  - A new taxon in the genus Neisseria.
AB  - Among 3,520 strains of Neisseria and Branhamella received in the laboratory during the last seven years, 13 could not be speciated. These 13 strains (Neisseria sp. group) were isolated from the throats of healthy children in Europe and Africa. The Neisseria sp. group oxidized glucose and maltose similarly to N. meningitidis. The observation of polysaccharide synthesis prompted the authors to examine the genomic relationship between the Neisseria sp. group and the type strains of all species of Neisseria and Branhamella. Additional phenotypic characteristics were also examined. Results indicated that the 13 strains in this study belong to the genus Neisseria, in which they constitute one homogenous hybridization group. They belong to the same genospecies as N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. flavescens and N. lactamica. However, they differ from N. meningitidis in production of polysaccharides, growth requirements and the lack of gamma-glutamyl transferase activity.
TI  - Siderophore production by pathogenic Neisseria spp.
AB  - Previous studies have established the importance of iron acquisition to the growth and virulence of Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Although preliminary evidence that the Neisseria spp. produce siderophores has been presented, the exact mechanism of iron acquisition has remained obscure. Siderophore production by N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis was induced in two different low-iron media. The iron-reactive siderophores, "gonobactin" and "meningobactin," were partially purified by ion exchange chromatography followed by extraction with phenol-chloroform-ether or by gel filtration. The compounds were of low molecular weight, their synthesis was repressed by iron in the medium, and they appeared to be hydroxamic acids since they were stimulatory for Arthrobacter flavescens JG-9 (a hydroxamate auxotroph) and gave a positive Csaky reaction for bound hydroxylamine. In the iron form, the compounds had an absorption maximum of approximately 420 nm. Although meningobactin stimulated growth of the gonococcus in low-iron media and vice versa, the homologous activity was more marked, indicating that the compounds, though similar, were probably not identical. As determined by A. flavescens assay the meningococcus produced three to five times more siderophore than did the gonococcus; however, the amount of siderophore present in the culture fluids of even the meningococcus was 100- to 1,000-fold lower than the concentration of hydroxamate siderophores reported to be produced by Bacillus megaterium or Aerobacter aerogenes. Virulent, colony type 1 N. gonorrhoeae produced significantly more gonobactin than did the avirulent colony type 3 gonococci.
TI  - Occurence of Veillonella and Neisseria in the niches of the human oral cavity.
AB  - Samples collected from the dental surface, gingival sulcus, dorsum of the tongue  and from the cheek of ten adults (18 to 32 years) were investigated to identify the Veillonella and Neisseria species present by applying the taxonomic criteria suggested in the latest edition of Bergey's Manual. The various niches contain both V. parvula and V. alcalescens, but with the predominance of strains which do not fit precisely the described catalase and putrescine requirements. Eighty-nine out of 100 isolated strains of Gram negative oxidase positive cocci could be identified as N. sicca and N. subflava; about 11 unidentified strains exhibited characteristics of N. flavescens species.
TI  - Dihydrofolate reductase from Neisseria sp.
AB  - Members of the genus Neisseria are relatively nonsusceptible to trimethoprim, an  inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. For example, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trimethoprim for N. gonorrhoeae ranges from 2 to 70 mug/ml, whereas the MIC for Escherichia coli is 0.2 mug/ml or less. In an effort to understand this difference, dihydrofolate reductase was partially purified from five Neisseria species and compared with the enzyme from E. coli. N. gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase was similar to that from E. coli in molecular weight (18,000) and affinity for the substrates reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and dihydrofolate (K(m) = 13 and 8 muM, respectively). However, the gonococcal enzyme had a decreased affinity for trimethoprim, with an apparent K(i) of 45 x 10(-9) M, some 30-fold greater than the E. coli value of 1.2 x 10(-9) M. These enzymes also differed in their isoelectric points and pH activity profiles. Within the genus Neisseria, the dihydrofolate reductase isolated from N. meningitidis and N. lactamica resembled the N. gonorrhoeae enzyme, and only small differences were detected for the N. flavescens and Branhamella catarrhalis dihydrofolate reductases. These data indicate that the relatively poor affinity of trimethoprim for the dihydrofolate reductase from these organisms may be largely responsible for the relative nonsusceptibility of Neisseria sp. to trimethoprim. The contribution of other resistance mechanisms to the overall nonsusceptibility was assessed. Strains of N. gonorrhoeae with altered cell envelope permeability had MIC values less than twofold different from those of isogenic wild-type strains. Also, a direct relationship was observed between the affinity of trimethoprim analogs for gonococcal dihydrofolate reductase and the MIC of these compounds for the gonococcus. These observations suggest that the cell envelope of N. gonorrhoeae is not impermeable to trimethoprim. Changes in the amount of dihydrofolate reductase activity could cause alterations in the susceptibility of the gonococcus to trimethoprim, as demonstrated with N. gonorrhoeae strains selected for trimethoprim resistance after chemical mutagenesis. However, the level of dihydrofolate reductase activity in wild-type N. gonorrhoeae was similar to that of E. coli, indicating that the difference in the susceptibility of these organisms is not due to greater amounts of enzyme in N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Cellular monosaccharide patterns of Neisseriaceae.
AB  - Sixty-four strains of Neisseria, Moraxella, and Acinetobacter were screened for cellular monosaccharides by gas-liquid chromatography and other chromatographic techniques. The four sugars ribose, glucose, glucosamine, and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO) were detected in all strains. Heptose was detected only in "true neisseriae" (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. sicca, N. cinerea, N. flavescens, and N. elongata) and in the tentaively named species Moraxella urethralis. Some marked interspecies dissimilarities within groups were revealed. Thus, N. ovis and M. atlantae were characterized by the presence of mannose. Intraspecies differences were also encountered. N. meningitidis strains of serogroups B and C were distinguished from strains of serogroup A by their sialic acid content. This sugar was also detected in two out of three examined strains of M. nonliquefaciens. In Acinetobacter, heterogeneity of monosaccharide patterns was rather pronounced. The results show the applicability of gas chromatographic "monosaccharide" profiles fo whole cells or extracted carbohydrate in bacterial classification and identification, including differentiation at the subspecies level. In addition, such profiles may be useful for monitoring during purification of cellular polysaccharides.
TI  - Selective isolation of Neisseria sicca from the human oral cavity on eosin methylene blue agar.
AB  - Strains of Neisseria sicca and N. mucosa, but not N. perflava, N. subflava, N. flava, or N. flavescens were found to grow on eosin methylene blue agar. The distribution of N. sicca on the tongue dorsum, the gingival crevice area, and the coronal surfaces of teeth of humans was determined using this medium. N. sicca averaged about 5% of the total cultivable organisms of the tongues of 14 subjects examined, but it was present in only trace quantities in dental plaque on the coronal surfaces of teeth or in the gingival crevice area.
TI  - Cellular and free lipopolysaccharides of some species of Neisseria.
AB  - Cultures of eight non-pathogenic species of Neisseria grown in simple defined media released lipopolysaccharide (free lipopolysaccharide) by a process distinct from cellular autolysis. Analyses of the pure cellular and free lipopolysaccharides obtained from six species of Neisseria revealed that they were remarkably similar and were devoid of detectable O-antigen side chains. Three distinct types of core-oligosaccharides were demonstrated. Type I core-oligosaccharide was a branched structure of alpha-D-glucopyranosyl units (7 mol) terminated by a reducing end group of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid. Type II core-oligosaccharide contained D-glucose, 2-deoxy-2-amino-D-glucose, L-rhamnose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid, phosphate, and ethanolamine in a molar ratio of 3:2:1:1:1:1:1. Type III coreoligosaccharide was composed of D-glucose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid, and phosphate in a molar ratio of 3:3:1:1. Lipopolysaccharides of N. caviae and N. sicca contained type I core-oligosaccharides exclusively, while those of N. flava and N. perflava contained only type II core-oligosaccharide. Cellular lipopolysaccharide from N. cinerea contained core-oligosaccharides of types I and II in a ratio of 27:73, while the analogous preparation from N. flavescens contained core-oligosaccharide types II and III in a ratio of 21:4. Free lipopolysaccharides from these two organisms contained only one type of coreoligosaccharide. Lipid A components of all the lipopolysaccharide preparations were very similar being composed of about 25% by weight of dodecanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-dodecanoic acid, and 3-hydroxy-tetradecanoic acid.
TI  - Nutritional requirements of some non-pathogenic Neisseria grown in simple synthetic media.
AB  - Ten species of non-pathogenic Neisseria were grown in simple defined liquid media containing amino acids, biotin, nicotinic acid, calcium pantothenate, ferrous sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and potassium phosphate. Two of these Neisseria were induced to grow with glutamic acid as the carbon and nitrogen source. The remaining eight Neisseria grew in glutamic acid medium supplemented with from one to four additional amino acids, lactate, or lactate and glucose. A strain of N. flavescens grew in the absence of added growth factors whereas the remaining nine species of Neisseria required either biotin or nicotinic acid; pantothenate was required by two and was stimulatory for three of these species. Use of carbohydrates by the non-pathogenic Neisseria in synthetic medium was tested. Two strains failed to use any of the 14 carbohydrates tested; one strain used only glucose; the remaining seven strains used fructose, glucose, maltose, and sucrose to varying degrees.
TI  - Reevaluation of bacteriocinogeny in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - Bacteriocin typing has been described previously and proposed for typing gonococci. A survey has been made of 150 strains of N. gonorrhoeae from various places to determine the feasibility of a gonocin typing system. All strains were found to produce an inhibitory substance which inhibited all strains of gonococci tested, one strain of Neisseria flavescens, two strains of Neisseria meningitidis, as well as the producing strain itself. The inhibitory activity was enhanced by supplementary glucose, reduced by supplementary serum, and unaffected by the addition of HEPES buffer, by the temperature of incubation, or by the exposure of potential producer strains to sublethal concentrations of mitomycin C. This nonspecific inhibitory activity differed from that of a putative bacteriocin produced by a strain of N. meningitidis, in that the latter inhibited most other meningococci but not the producer strain itself. Bacteriocinogeny has not yet been convincingly demonstrated in N. gonorrhoeae, and gonocin typing has not yet been shown to be feasible. Production of the nonspecific inhibitor may have obscured past attempts to demonstrate type-specific gonococcal bacteriocin.

TI  - Effect of glutamate on exogenous citrate catabolism of Neisseria meningitidis and of other species of Neisseria.
AB  - Resting cell suspensions of Neisseria meningitidis group B (strain 2091) do not catabolize citrate as the sole substrate to an appreciable degree. When another substrate, such as glutamate, is also present to furnish energy for transport, citrate metabolism is greatly stimulated. Within limits, the amount of CO(2) produced from citrate is proportional to the amount of glutamate added. When the cells are disrupted, citrate is degraded at a rapid rate and the stimulatory effect of glutamate is completely eliminated. Pronounced stimulation of citrate metabolism by glutamate was demonstrated in 12 of 13 strains of N. meningitidis tested and only 1 of 6 strains of N. lactamicus. The remaining strains of N. lactamicus and one each of N. gonorrhoeae, N. flavescens, and N. flava did not utilize significant amounts of citrate in the absence or presence of glutamate. N. catarrhalis shared with Mima polymorpha and Moraxella glucidolytica a capability to catabolize citrate at a rapid rate without added glutamate. It is concluded that tests of glutamate-stimulated citrate metabolism may contribute to species characterization in the genus Neisseria.
TI  - Septicaemia caused by Neisseria flavescens.
AB  - Septicaemia caused by N. flavescens is reported for the first time. The septicaemia developed following dental surgery, and the clinical picture was indistinguishable from that of chronic meningococcaemia. The skin lesions resembled the cutaneous manifestations of gonococcaemia. The patient responded to treatment with sulphonamides and penicillin with no relapse over 18 months of follow-up.
TI  - Fatty acid composition of Neisseria species as determined by gas chromatography.
AB  - Duplicate cultures of 53 strains representing 9 species of Neisseria were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography for cellular fatty acids. N. sicca, N. mucosa, N. flava, N. flavescens, N. perflava, N. subflava, and the several serotypes of N. meningitidis examined were found to comprise a fairly homogeneous group on the basis of the percentages of individual fatty acids present. Lactose-fermenting Neisseria also were in this group. N. catarrhalis, however, contained decanoic acid in addition to the acids occurring in the other species. Moreover, the 18 C-saturated and monoenoic acids together constituted 36% of the total fatty acid composition for N. catarrhalis, while the comparable mean value for the other species was less than 13%.

TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus Neisseria.
AB  - Eleven aerobic species of Neisseria, a Mima sp., and a Herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) homology in direct hybridization experiments. DNA labeled with either (14)C or (32)P was prepared from five species of Neisseria. Unlabeled DNA from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled DNA (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 C. The measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous DNA. All serological types of N. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of N. meningitidis with one possible exception, type Z. The genus Neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae; second, N. perflava, N. subflava, N. sicca, N. flavescens, and N. flava; third, N. catarrhalis and N. caviae. Mima and Herellea species show no significant homology with the Neisseria.
