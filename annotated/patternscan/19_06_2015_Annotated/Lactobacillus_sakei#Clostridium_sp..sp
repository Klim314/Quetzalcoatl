TI  == diversity of the resident microbiota in a thermophilic municipal biogas plant.
AB  == biogas plants continuously convert biological wastes mainly into a mixture of methane, co2 and h2o-a conversion that is carried out by a consortium of bacteria and archaea. especially in the municipal plants dedicated towards waste treatment, the reactor feed may vary considerably, exposing the resident microbiota to a changing variety of substrates. to evaluate how and if such changes influence the microbiology, an established biogas plant (6,600 m3, up to  600 m3 biogas per h) was followed over the course of more than 2 years via polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rrna genes and subsequent sequencing. both the bacterial and the archaeal community remained stable over the investigation. of the bacterial consortium, about half of the sequences were in decreasing order of occurrence: thermoacetogenium sp., anaerobaculum mobile, clostridium ultunense, petrotoga sp., lactobacillus hammesii, butyrivibrio sp., syntrophococcus sucromutans, olsenella sp., tepidanaerobacter sp., sporanaerobacter acetigenes, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, lactobacillus fuchuensis or lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus parabrevis or lactobacillus spicheri and enterococcus faecalis. the other half matched closely to ones from similar habitats (thermophilic anaerobic methanogenic digestion). the archaea consisted of methanobrevibacter sp., methanoculleus bourgensis, methanosphaera stadtmanae, methanimicrococcus blatticola and uncultured methanomicrobiales. the role of these species in methane production is discussed.

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
