TI  == a new hydrolase specific for taurine-conjugates of bile acids.
AB  == through the investigation of the bile acid-deconjugation activities of human intestinal anaerobes, a new enzyme was discovered in peptostreptococcus intermedius which hydrolyzed specifically the taurine-conjugates, but not the glycine-conjugates of bile acids. however, the enzymes in streptococcus faecalis  and lactobacillus brevis hydrolyzed chiefly the glycine-conjugates.
