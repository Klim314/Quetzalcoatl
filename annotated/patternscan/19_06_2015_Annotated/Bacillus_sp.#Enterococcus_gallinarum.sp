TI  == microstructure, microbial profile and quality characteristics of high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets.
AB  == high-pressure processing (300 mpa for 5 min) as a non-thermal post-processing intervention was employed to improve the shelf life and qualities of cooked refrigerated chicken nuggets. pomegranate peel extract (1%) was also used as a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial in chicken nuggets. microstructure, microbial profile, instrumental colour, texture profile and lipid oxidation were evaluated. high-pressure treatment and pomegranate peel extract did not influence significantly the colour and textural properties of cooked chicken nuggets. thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values significantly (p < 0.05) increased in pressure-treated nuggets. microstructural studies revealed shrinkage in the structure and loosening of the dense network of meat emulsion due to high-pressure treatment. pressure treatment resulted in a reduction of 2-3.0 log10 cfu/g in total plate count and enterobacteriaceae count. molecular characterization studies revealed that enterobacter amnigenus and enterobacter sp. in control and bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus gallinarum and acinetobacter baumannii in high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets were the major spoilage bacteria.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
