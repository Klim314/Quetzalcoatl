TI  == miropin, a novel bacterial serpin from the periodontopathogen tannerella forsythia, inhibits a broad range of proteases by using different peptide bonds within the reactive center loop.
AB  == all prokaryotic genes encoding putative serpins identified to date are found in environmental and commensal microorganisms, and only very few prokaryotic serpins have been investigated from a mechanistic standpoint. herein, we characterized a  novel serpin (miropin) from the human pathogen tannerella forsythia, a bacterium  implicated in initiation and progression of human periodontitis. in contrast to other serpins, miropin efficiently inhibited a broad range of proteases (neutrophil and pancreatic elastases, cathepsin g, subtilisin, and trypsin) with  a stoichiometry of inhibition of around 3 and second-order association rate constants that ranged from 2.7 x 10(4) (cathepsin g) to 7.1 x 10(5) m(-1)s(-1) (subtilisin). inhibition was associated with the formation of complexes that were stable during sds-page. the unusually broad specificity of miropin for target proteases is achieved through different active sites within the reactive center loop upstream of the p1-p1' site, which was predicted from an alignment of the primary structure of miropin with those of well studied human and prokaryotic serpins. thus, miropin is unique among inhibitory serpins, and it has apparently  evolved the ability to inhibit a multitude of proteases at the expense of a high  stoichiometry of inhibition and a low association rate constant. these characteristics suggest that miropin arose as an adaptation to the highly proteolytic environment of subgingival plaque, which is exposed continually to an array of host proteases in the inflammatory exudate. in such an environment, miropin may function as an important virulence factor by protecting bacterium from the destructive activity of neutrophil serine proteases. alternatively, it may act as a housekeeping protein that regulates the activity of endogenous t. forsythia serine proteases.

TI  == structural and functional characterization of nanu, a novel high-affinity sialic  acid-inducible binding protein of oral and gut-dwelling bacteroidetes species.
AB  == many human-dwelling bacteria acquire sialic acid for growth or surface display. we identified previously a sialic acid utilization operon in tannerella forsythia that includes a novel outer membrane sialic acid-transport system (nanou), where  nano (neuraminate outer membrane permease) is a putative tonb-dependent receptor  and nanu (extracellular neuraminate uptake protein) is a predicted susd family protein. using heterologous complementation of nanou genes into an escherichia coli strain devoid of outer membrane sialic acid permeases, we show that the nanou system from the gut bacterium bacteroides fragilis is functional and demonstrate its dependence on tonb for function. we also show that nanu is required for maximal function of the transport system and that it is expressed in a sialic acid-responsive manner. we also show its cellular localization to the outer membrane using fractionation and immunofluorescence experiments. ligand-binding studies revealed high-affinity binding of sialic acid to nanu (kd  ~400 nm) from two bacteroidetes species as well as binding of a range of sialic acid analogues. determination of the crystal structure of nanu revealed a monomeric susd-like structure containing a novel motif characterized by an extended kinked helix that might determine sugar-binding specificity. the results of the present study characterize the first bacterial extracellular sialic acid-binding protein and define a sialic acid-specific pul (polysaccharide utilization locus).

TI  == ompa-like protein influences cell shape and adhesive activity of tannerella forsythia.
AB  == tannerella forsythia, a gram-negative fusiform rod, is implicated in several types of oral anaerobic infections. most gram-negative bacteria have ompa-like proteins that are homologous to the ompa protein in escherichia coli. we identified an ompa-like protein in t. forsythia encoded by the tf1331 gene as one of the major proteins by mass spectrometric analysis. two-dimensional, diagonal electrophoresis showed that the ompa-like protein formed a dimeric or trimeric structure via intermolecular disulfide bonds. a biotin labeling experiment revealed that a portion of the protein was exposed on the cell surface, even though t. forsythia possesses an s-layer at the outermost cell surface. using a tf1331-deletion mutant, we showed that the ompa-like protein affected cell morphology. the length of the mutant cell was reduced almost by half. cell swelling was observed in more than 40% of the mutant cells. moreover, the mutant  exhibited decreased adhesion to fibronectin, retarded autoaggregation, and reduced cell surface hydrophobicity. these results suggest that the ompa-like protein in t. forsythia plays an important role in cellular integrity and adhesive function.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == a novel sialic acid utilization and uptake system in the periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is a key contributor to periodontitis, but little is known of its virulence mechanisms. in this study we have investigated the role of sialic acid in biofilm growth of this periodontal pathogen. our data show that biofilm growth of t. forsythia is stimulated by sialic acid, glycolyl sialic acid, and sialyllactose, all three of which are common sugar moieties on a range  of important host glycoproteins. we have also established that growth on sialyllactose is dependent on the sialidase of t. forsythia since the sialidase inhibitor oseltamivir suppresses growth on sialyllactose. the genome of t. forsythia contains a sialic acid utilization locus, which also encodes a putative inner membrane sialic acid permease (nant), and we have shown this is functional  when it is expressed in escherichia coli. this genomic locus also contains a putatively novel tonb-dependent outer membrane sialic acid transport system (tf0033-tf0034). in complementation studies using an escherichia coli strain devoid of its outer membrane sialic acid transporters, the cloning and expression of the tf0033-tf0034 genes enabled an e. coli nanr nanc ompr strain to utilize sialic acid as the sole carbon and energy source. we have thus identified a novel sialic acid uptake system that couples an inner membrane permease with a tonb-dependent outer membrane transporter, and we propose to rename these novel sialic acid uptake genes nano and nanu, respectively. taken together, these data  indicate that sialic acid is a key growth factor for this little-characterized oral pathogen and may be key to its physiology in vivo.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == an orthologue of bacteroides fragilis nanh is the principal sialidase in tannerella forsythia.
AB  == sialidase activity is a putative virulence factor of the anaerobic periodontal pathogen tannerella forsythia, but it is uncertain which genes encode this activity. characterization of a putative sialidase, siahi, by others, indicated that this protein alone may not be responsible for all of the sialidase activity. we describe a second sialidase in t. forsythia (tf0035), an orthologue of bacteroides fragilis nanh, and its expression in escherichia coli. sialidase activity of the expressed nanh was confirmed by using 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate. biochemical characterization of the recombinant t. forsythia nanh indicated that  it was active over a broad ph range, with optimum activity at ph 5.5. this enzyme has high affinity for 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid (k(m) of 32.9 +/- 10.3 microm) and rapidly releases 4-methylumbelliferone (v(max) of 170.8 +/- 11.8 nmol of 4-methylumbelliferone min(-1) mg of protein(-1)). e. coli lysates containing recombinant t. forsythia nanh cleave sialic acid from a range of substrates, with a preference for alpha2-3 glycosidic linkages. the genes adjacent to nanh encode proteins apparently involved in the metabolism of sialic acid, indicating that the nanh sialidase is likely to be involved in nutrient acquisition.

TI  == bacterial diversity in aortic aneurysms determined by 16s ribosomal rna gene analysis.
AB  == background: aortic aneurysms are common vascular conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of the condition remains limited. recently, infection has been suggested as possible contributor in the development of the disease. the aim of the present study was to examine aortic aneurysms for the presence of bacterial dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)  gene, followed by cloning and sequencing. methods: universal eubacterial primers  were used to amplify 16s rrna bacterial genes in 10 specimens from arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. subsequently, pcr amplicons were cloned into escherichia coli and sequencing of the cloned inserts was used to determine species identity  or closest relatives by comparison with known sequences in genbank. results: sequences of stenotrophomonas spp., including s. maltophilia (formerly pseudomonas homology group v) were detected in six aneurysm samples. propionibacterium acnes was identified in five samples, and brevundimonas diminuta (formerly p. diminuta) in four samples. other species previously assigned to the pseudomonas genus such as comamonas testosteroni, delftia acidovorans, burkholderia cepacia, herbaspirillum sp., and acidovorax sp. were also detected. some clones fell into other environmental species, including methylobacterium sp. and bradyrhizobium elkanii, and others represented bacteria  that have not yet been cultivated. dna sequences from oral bacteria, including streptococcus sanguinis, tannerella forsythia, and leptotrichia buccalis were detected. sequences from prevotella melaninogenica and lactobacillus delbrueckii, which are commonly found in both mouth and gastrointestinal tract, were also detected. additional species included dermacoccus spp. and corynebacterium vitaeruminis. conclusions: a wide variety of bacteria, including oral bacteria, was found to colonize aortic aneurysms and may play a role in their development.  several of these microorganisms have not yet been cultivated. clinical relevance: although chlamydophila pneumoniae has been detected in aneurysmal walls, its exact role in the condition remains inconclusive. overall, there is scarce information about the role of microorganisms in aneurysmal disease. in the present study, we used molecular genetics to detect a diversity of bacteria in arterial walls of aortic aneurysms. the presence of multiple microorganisms in aneurysmal disease may have implications for chemoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment if directed only at c.pneumoniae.

TI  == anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. the continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (lps) from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and escherichia coli. interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted (rantes) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by lps was evaluated by elisa. our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was  a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by lps. this suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives  for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.
