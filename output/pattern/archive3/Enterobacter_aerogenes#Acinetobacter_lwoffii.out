antibacterial activity of bms-180680, a new catechol-containing monobactam.
the in vitro activities of a new catechol-containing monobactam, bms-180680 (sq 84,100), were compared to those of aztreonam, ceftazidime, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. bms-180680 was often the most active compound against many species of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.5 microg/ml for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, proteus spp., and providencia spp. bms-180680 had moderate activities (mic90s of 2 to 8 microg/ml) against citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii, shigella spp., and non-e. aerogenes enterobacter spp. bms-180680 was the only antibiotic evaluated that was active against >90% of the pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 0.25 microg/ml), burkholderia cepacia, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90s, 1 microg/ml) strains tested. bms-180680 was inactive against most strains of pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas stutzeri, pseudomonas diminuta, and burkholderia pickettii. bms-180680 was moderately active (mic90s of 4 to 8 microg/ml) against alcaligenes spp. and acinetobacter lwoffii and less active (mic90, 16 microg/ml) against acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumanii complex. bms-180680 lacked activity against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. both tonb and cir fiu double mutants of e. coli had greatly decreased susceptibility to bms-180680. of the tem, pse, and chromosomal-encoded beta-lactamases tested, only the k1 enzyme hydrolyzed bms-180680 to any measurable extent. like aztreonam, bms-180680 bound preferentially to penicillin-binding protein 3. the mics of bms-180680 were not influenced by the presence of hematin or 5% sheep blood in the test medium or with incubation in an atmosphere containing 5% co2. bms-180680 mics obtained under strict anaerobic conditions were significantly higher than those obtained in ambient air.
