TI  - [Selective-differential nutrient medium "Shewanella IRHLS agar" for isolation of  Shewanella genus bacteria].
AB  - AIM: Development of a selective-differential nutrient medium for isolation of Shewanella genus bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 73 strains of Shewanella bacteria (S. algae--3, S. baltica--26, S. putrefaciens--44) and 80 strains of 22 other bacteria genera were used. Shewanella species were identified by methods and criteria proposed by Nozue H. et al., 1992; Khashe S. et al., 1998. RESULTS: Nutrient media "Shewanella IRHLS Agar" for shewanella isolation was developed. Medium selective factors: irgazan DP-300 (I). 0.14-0.2 g/l and rifampicin (R) 0.0005-0.001 g/l. Shevanella colonies were detected by the production of hydrogen sulfide (H), lipase presence (L), lack of sorbitol fermentation (S). The medium suppressed the growth of hydrogen sulfide producers (Salmonella, Proteus) and blocked hydrogen sulfide production by Citrobacter. Growth of Escherichia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Bacillus was also suppressed, Analytical sensitivity of the medium was 1-2 CFU/ml for Shewanella and Stenotrophomonas, Aerombnas, Serratia genera bacteria. 72 strains of Shewanella were isolated from water of Neva river in this medium, 91.7 +/- 3.2% of those produced H2S. 1 strain of S. algae was isolated from clinical material. CONCLUSION: The developed media allows to use it in a complex for Stenotrophomo- nas sp., Aeromonas sp., Serratia sp., Citrobactersp. and Shewanella bacteria isolation.
TI  - Purification of a secreted lectin from Andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. ADL produced an 8.5 kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH 4-5. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+ or Mg2+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.
TI  - Diversity and antimicrobial potential of culturable heterotrophic bacteria associated with the endemic marine sponge Arenosclera brasiliensis.
AB  - Marine sponges are the oldest Metazoa, very often presenting a complex microbial  consortium. Such is the case of the marine sponge Arenosclera brasiliensis, endemic to Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. In this investigation we characterized the diversity of some of the culturable heterotrophic bacteria living in association with A. brasiliensis and determined their antimicrobial activity. The genera Endozoicomonas (N = 32), Bacillus (N = 26), Shewanella (N = 17), Pseudovibrio (N = 12), and Ruegeria (N = 8) were dominant among the recovered isolates, corresponding to 97% of all isolates. Approximately one third of the isolates living in association with A. brasiliensis produced antibiotics that inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, suggesting that bacteria associated with this sponge play a role in its health.
TI  - Culturable Aerobic and Facultative Anaerobic Intestinal Bacterial Flora of Black  Cobra (Naja naja karachiensis) in Southern Pakistan.
AB  - Using morphological analysis and biochemical testing, here for the first time, we determined the culturable gut bacterial flora (aerobes and facultative anaerobes) in the venomous Black Cobra (Naja naja karachiensis) from South Asia. The findings revealed that these snakes inhabit potentially pathogenic bacteria including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shewanella putrefaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella sp., Moraxella sp., Bacillus sp., Ochrobactrum anthropi, and Providencia rettgeri. These findings are of concern, as injury from snake bite can result in wound infections and tissue necrosis leading to sepsis/necrotizing fasciitis and/or expose consumers of snake meat/medicine in the community to infections.
TI  - Effect of dietary supplementation of probiotics and palm fruits extracts on the antioxidant enzyme gene expression in the mucosae of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.).
AB  - Antioxidant activity is particularly important, since oxidation is an unavoidable reaction in all living bodies. At present, natural antioxidants to be used on food as an alternative to synthetic ones are being sought. Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) specimens were fed for 4 weeks with diets enriched with bacterial probiotics (Shewanella putrefaciens Pdp11 and Bacillus sp), single or in combination with Tunisian dates palm fruit extracts. The expression of the main antioxidant enzyme genes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione reductase) in the mucosae (gut, skin and gill) was evaluated after 2 and 4 weeks. Previously, free radical scavenging and several antioxidant assays were developed to know the antioxidant properties present on the palm fruits extracts. The results demonstrated that experimental diets alter the expression of the studied antioxidant genes, primarily in the gill and skin. Furthermore, the tested probiotics and mainly, the aqueous date palm fruits extracts had significant antioxidant properties based on their protective effect against the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species, especially when administering during 4 weeks. For this reason, probiotics and date palm fruit extracts may serve as good natural antioxidants and could potentially be considered as a functional food ingredient for fish in farms.
TI  - Isolation and screening of probiotic candidates from marron, Cherax cainii (Austin, 2002) gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and commercial probiotic products for the use in marron culture.
AB  - Six strains of bacteria including Bacillus mycoides (A10) and Shewanella species  (A12) isolated from healthy marron intestine, Bacillus species (PM1), Bacillus subtilis (PM3), Bacillus sp. (PM4) and Bacillus sp. (AQ) from commercial probiotic products were investigated for probiotic potential in marron culture. Antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated PM3 and PM4 were susceptible to all nine antibiotics evaluated. A10, A12 and AQ were resistant to class penicillins, whereas PM1 was resistant to class penicillin and macrolides. All strains were non-pathogenic for marron. Strong inhibition against Vibrio mimicus and Vibrio cholerae non-01 was exhibited by PM4 and PM3. A10 inhibited V. mimicus at 72 h of growth, but not V. cholerae non-01, whereas A12 inhibited V. cholerae non-01 but not V. mimicus, and AQ showed no inhibition activity. A wide range of enzymes were produced by A10 and AQ using the API ZYM test. Protease enzymes were produced by PM3, PM4, AQ and PM1. In order of effectiveness, the following bacteria have probiotic potential: B. subtilis (PM3), Bacillus sp. (PM4) and B. mycoides (A10). Further study is required to determine the bacterium or any combination that gives a multibeneficial effect on marron.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  - Surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. The aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, Bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. The identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. The antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Antimicrobial activities were evaluated against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. A total of 39 Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as Vibrio sp. (48.72%), Alteromonas sp. (12.82%), Shewanella sp. (12.26%), Serratia sp. (2.56%), Citricoccus sp. (2.56%), Cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), Ruegeria sp. (2.56%) and Staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). Six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) match, and some of those could be new. The highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against B. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (Shewanella sp.). Several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, mainly belonging to Alteromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. There were no positive results against fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Immunological responses of customised probiotics-fed marron, Cherax tenuimanus, (Smith 1912) when challenged with Vibrio mimicus.
AB  - A two-phased experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of customised probiotics on marron physiology. During the first phase marron were fed probiotic supplemented feed for 70 days, while in phase two the same marron were challenged with Vibrio mimicus and their physiological responses were investigated for 4 days post-challenged. The experiment was carried out in a purpose-built room, designed for aquaculture research, using 18 of 250 L cylindrical plastic tanks. Five species of isolated probiotic bacteria from commercial probiotic products and marron's intestine were tested in this experiment. The probiotic bacteria were (Bacillus sp.); A10 (Bacillus mycoides); A12 (Shewanella sp.); PM3 (Bacillus subtilis); and PM4 (Bacillus sp.), which were added to the formulated basal marron diet (34% crude protein, 8% crude lipid, 6% ash) at a concentration of 10(8) cfu/g of feed. Immune responses of marron fed probiotics were evaluated by investigating organosomatic indices, growth rate, survival, intermoult period, total haemocytes counts (THC), proportion of granular cells (GC), bacteraemia, bacteria load in the intestine and water quality. The results showed that dietary supplementation of probiotics in marron had no significant impact on growth, intermoult period and survival of the marron. However, their supplementation improved the physiological condition of marron in terms of significantly higher tail muscle indices, THC and proportion of granular cells (GC) and reduced bacterial load in the haemolymph. The addition of probiotics in marron diets also increased the bacteria load in the marron intestine. In addition, dietary supplementation of the customised probiotics was effective in improving the resistance of marron against V. mimicus as they had higher THC, higher proportion of GC and lower presence of bacteria in their haemolymph, after marron were challenged with V. mimicus. The results also showed that probiotic Bacillus mycoides (A10) and PM4 are the most beneficial dietary probiotics for marron health.
TI  - Culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the bacterial community structure from the intestinal tracts of earthworms(Eisenia fetida).
AB  - The bacterial communities in the intestinal tracts of earthworm were investigated by culture-dependent and - independent approaches. In total, 72 and 55 pure cultures were isolated from the intestinal tracts of earthworms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. Aerobic bacteria were classified as Aeromonas (40%), Bacillus (37%), Photobacterium (10%), Pseudomonas (7%), and Shewanella (6%). Anaerobic bacteria were classified as Aeromonas (52%), Bacillus (27%), Shewanella (12%), Paenibacillus (5%), Clostridium (2%), and Cellulosimicrobium (2%). The dominant microorganisms were Aeromonas and Bacillus species under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In all, 39 DNA fragments were identified by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis. Aeromonas sp. was the dominant microorganism in feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms. The DGGE band intensity of Aeromonas from feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms was 12.8%, 14.7%, and 15.1%, respectively. The other strains identified were Bacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, Photobacterium, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, Streptomyces, uncultured Chloroflexi bacterium, and uncultured bacterium. These results suggest that PCR-DGGE analysis was more efficient than the culture-dependent approach for the investigation of bacterial diversity and the identification of unculturable microorganisms.
TI  - Characterisation of the microbiota of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus).
AB  - In this study the microbiota of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) collected by a commercial purse seiner was examined. Fish were collected directly from the purse seine and from the Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) transport tank after loading. The culturable microbiota and Specific Spoilage Bacteria (SSB) were quantified on Iron Agar Lyngby (IAL) and identified using commercially available Biochemical API(R) kits on pure cultured isolates. These kits showed to be sub-optimal in characterising the isolates, since only half of the strains were identified. The same isolates were also identified by a nucleic acid based PCR-DGGE approach, and only half of the sequences gave the same results as the API(R). Characterisation by PCR-DGGE was also performed on bacterial DNA from IAL plates (bulk cell samples) and on samples where the bacterial DNA was extracted directly from fish material without any cultivation (direct DNA samples). The microbiota of Atlantic mackerel was dominated by members of the Gram-negative genera as Psychrobacter sp., Proteus sp., Photobacterium sp., Vibrio sp., Shewanella sp., Synechococcus sp., Oceanisphaerae sp., Bizonia sp., Pseudoalteromonas sp., and members of Flavobacteriaceae. Gram-positive bacteria in the genera Vagococcus sp., Bacillus sp., Mycobacterium sp., Staphylococcus sp., Mycoplasma sp. and Clostridia sp. were also found. Examination by PCR-DGGE and sequencing of the bulk cell pellet after cultivation on IAL, gave a higher number of taxa as compared to extraction and examination of bacterial DNA from fish materials without prior cultivation. This shows the benefit of combining both culture dependent and culture independent methods, when studying the microbiota of marine fish. Several Vibrio spp. were found only in gut samples collected from the purse seine, but in all samples including the skin and the gills collected from the RSW tank, indicating microbial contamination by faecal bacteria from the fish under these transport conditions.
TI  - Investigation of mineral water springs of Miercurea Ciuc (Csikszereda) region (Romania) with cultivation-dependent microbiological methods.
AB  - Water samples of ten mineral water springs at Miercurea Ciuc (Csikszereda) region (Romania) were examined during 2005-2006 using cultivation-dependent microbiological methods. The results of standard hygienic bacteriological tests showed that the Hargita Spring had perfect and five other springs had microbiologically acceptable water quality (Zsogod-, Nagy-borviz-, Taploca-, Szentegyhaza- and Lobogo springs). The water of Borsaros Spring was exceptionable (high germ count, presence of Enterococcus spp.).Both standard bacteriological and molecular microbiological methods indicated that the microbiological water quality of the Szeltersz-, Nadasszek- and Delo springs was not acceptable. Bad water quality resulted from inadequate spring catchment and hygiene (low yield, lack of runoff, negligent usage of the springs, horse manure around the spring).The 16S rRNA gene-based identification of strains isolated on standard meat-peptone medium resulted in the detection of typical aquatic organisms such as Shewanella baltica, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas veronii, Psychrobacter sp,. Acinetobacter spp. and allochthonous microbes, like Nocardia, Streptomyces, Bacillus, Microbacterium , and Arthrobacter strains indicating the impact of soil. Other allochthonous microbes, such as Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus sp., Lactococcus sp., Clostridium butyricum, Yersinia spp., Aerococcus sp., may have originated from animal/human sources.
TI  - Defensin of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  - A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system. The antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant Dpd were found against the growth of Morganella sp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Edwardsiella tarda, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus aureus (ATCC12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microM, respectively. However, with less than 50 microM no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, Motile Aeromonas, Flavobacterium sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium ATCC14581, Carnobacterium maltaromaticum ATCC27865, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19433, and Micrococcus leteus ATCC4698), and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) of Dpd in the zebra mussel suggested that the Dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. By using the quantitative PCR, the expression level of Dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. By comparing the amount of Dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qPCR, we found that the higher expression levels of Dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. Findings of this study suggest that the expression of the Dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.
TI  - Mercury stable isotope fractionation during reduction of Hg(II) by different microbial pathways.
AB  - Mercury (Hg) stable isotope fractionation has recently been developed as a tool in biogeochemistry. In this study, the extent of Hg stable isotope fractionation during reduction of ionic mercury [Hg(II)] by two Hg(II)-resistant strains, Bacillus cereus 5 and the thermophile Anoxybacillus sp. FB9 [which actively detoxify Hg(II) by the mer system] and a Hg(II)-sensitive metal-reducing anaerobe, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 [which reduces Hg(II) at low concentrations], was investigated. In all cases, barring suppression of fractionation that is likely due to lower Hg(II) bioavailability, the Hg(II) remaining in the reactor became progressively enriched with heavy isotopes with time and underwent mass-dependent Rayleigh fractionation with alpha202/198 values of 1.0016 +/- 0.0004 (1 SD). Based on a multistep framework for the Hg(II) reduction pathways in the three strains, we constrain the processes that could contribute toward fractionation and suggest that for Hg(II)-resistant strains, reduction by mercuric reductase is the primary step causing fractionation. The proposed framework helps explain the variation in the extent of Hg stable isotope fractionation during microbial reduction of Hg(II), furthering the promise of Hg isotope ratios as a tool in determining the role of microbial Hg transformations in the environment.
TI  - Microbial iron redox cycling in a circumneutral-pH groundwater seep.
AB  - The potential for microbially mediated redox cycling of iron (Fe) in a circumneutral-pH groundwater seep in north central Alabama was studied. Incubation of freshly collected seep material under anoxic conditions with acetate-lactate or H(2) as an electron donor revealed the potential for rapid Fe(III) oxide reduction (ca. 700 to 2,000 micromol liter(-1) day(-1)). Fe(III) reduction at lower but significant rates took place in unamended controls (ca. 300 micromol liter(-1) day(-1)). Culture-based enumerations (most probable numbers [MPNs]) revealed significant numbers (10(2) to 10(6) cells ml(-1)) of organic carbon- and H(2)-oxidizing dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms. Three isolates with the ability to reduce Fe(III) oxides by dissimilatory or fermentative metabolism were obtained (Geobacter sp. strain IST-3, Shewanella sp. strain IST-21, and Bacillus sp. strain IST-38). MPN analysis also revealed the presence of microaerophilic Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms (10(3) to 10(5) cells ml(-1)). A 16S rRNA gene library from the iron seep was dominated by representatives of the Betaproteobacteria including Gallionella, Leptothrix, and Comamonas species. Aerobic Fe(II)-oxidizing Comamonas sp. strain IST-3 was isolated. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of this organism is 100% similar to the type strain of the betaproteobacterium Comamonas testosteroni (M11224). Testing of the type strain showed no Fe(II) oxidation. Collectively our results suggest that active microbial Fe redox cycling occurred within this habitat and support previous conceptual models for how microbial Fe oxidation and reduction can be coupled in surface and subsurface sedimentary environments.
TI  - [Taxonomic composition of bacteria associated with cultivated mollusks Crassostrea lugubris and Perna viridis and with the water of the Gulf of Nha Trang Lagoon, Vietnam].
AB  - One hundred and four strains of heterotrophic bacteria have been isolated and characterized from two species of bivalve mollusks cultivated in the Gulf of Nha Trang (Vietnam) and from the water of a mariculture farm. The isolates have been identified on the basis of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and chemotaxonomic properties, as well as by the content of G+C bases in DNA. In the microflora of mollusks, Vibrio alginolyticus was predominant; the pathogenic species V. harveyi and V. splendidus were found as well. Staphylococci and bacilli occupied the second place in abundance after vibrios. In addition, coryneforms and enterobacteria, as well as Pseudomonas spp. and Pseudoalteromonas spp., were revealed. The composition of the water microflora was more diverse as compared with the microflora of mollusks. In the water, Bacillus spp., Vibrio spp., and Pseudomonas spp. were predominant. Brevibacterium spp. and other coryneform bacteria, as well as enterobacteria, occurred in significant amounts. In addition, Pseudoalteromonas spp., Marinococcus sp., Halobacillus sp., Shewanella sp., Sulfitobacter sp., and bacteria of the CFB cluster were noticed. The presence of pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic bacterial species in the water and mollusks is probably the reason for the high death rate of cultivated animals at the mariculture farm.
TI  - Evaluation of preservative systems in a sunscreen formula by linear regression method.
AB  - A sunscreen formula with eight different preservative systems was evaluated by linear regression, pharmacopeial, and the CTFA (Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association) methods. The preparations were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, Shewanella putrefaciens, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus sp. The linear regression method proved to be useful in the selection of the most effective preservative system used in cosmetic formulation.
TI  - Cold-adapted alanine dehydrogenases from two antarctic bacterial strains: gene cloning, protein characterization, and comparison with mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts.
AB  - The genes encoding NAD(+)-dependent alanine dehydrogenases (AlaDHs) (EC 1.4.1.1)  from the Antarctic bacterial organisms Shewanella sp. strain Ac10 (SheAlaDH) and Carnobacterium sp. strain St2 (CarAlaDH) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Of all of the AlaDHs that have been sequenced, SheAlaDH exhibited the highest level of sequence similarity to the AlaDH from the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio proteolyticus (VprAlaDH). CarAlaDH was most similar to AlaDHs from mesophilic and thermophilic Bacillus strains. SheAlaDH and CarAlaDH had features typical of cold-adapted enzymes; both the optimal temperature for catalytic activity and the temperature limit for retaining thermostability were lower than the values obtained for the mesophilic counterparts. The k(cat)/K(m) value for the SheAlaDH reaction was about three times higher than the k(cat)/K(m) value for VprAlaDH, but it was much lower than the k(cat)/K(m) value for the AlaDH from Bacillus subtilis. Homology-based structural models of various AlaDHs, including the two psychotropic AlaDHs, were constructed. The thermal instability of SheAlaDH and CarAlaDH may result from relatively low numbers of salt bridges in these proteins.
