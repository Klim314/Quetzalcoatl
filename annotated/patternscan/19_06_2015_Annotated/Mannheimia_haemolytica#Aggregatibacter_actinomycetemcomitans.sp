TI  == n-terminal region of mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin serves as a mitochondrial  targeting signal in mammalian cells.
AB  == mannheimia haemolytica leukotoxin (lkta) is a member of the rtx toxin family that specifically kills ruminant leukocytes. previous studies have shown that lkta induces apoptosis in susceptible cells via a caspase-9-dependent pathway that involves binding of lkta to mitochondria. in this study, using the bioinformatics tool mitoprot ii we identified an n-terminal amino acid sequence of lkta that represents a mitochondrial targeting signal (mts). we show that expression of this sequence, as a gfp fusion protein within mammalian cells, directs gfp to mitochondria. by immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that lkta interacts with the  tom22 and tom40 components of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (tom), which suggests that import of this toxin into mitochondria involves a classical import pathway for endogenous proteins. we also analysed the amino acid sequences of other rtx toxins and found a mts in the n-terminal region of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae apxii and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ehxa, but not in a. pleuropneumoniae apxi, apxiii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ltxa or the haemolysin (hlya) from uropathogenic strains of e. coli. these findings provide a new evidence for the importance of the n-terminal region in addressing certain rtx toxins to mitochondria.

TI  == outer membrane-like vesicles secreted by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are enriched in leukotoxin.
AB  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is associated with early onset periodontal diseases and secretes membranous vesicles that appear to contain several virulence-associated proteins. however, the composition of these vesicles and the process leading to their secretion are not well defined. electron micrographs of  thin sectioned bacterial cells and purified vesicle preparations showed that vesicles are spherical lipid bilayers, 50-100 nm in diameter, that appear to form by budding from the outer membrane of the bacterium. thin layer chromatography identified the predominant lipid components of vesicles as lipopolysaccharide, phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin, similar to the main lipid constituents  of the outer membrane. however, vesicles also contained minor lipids that were not detected in outer membrane samples. the major protein constituents of vesicles co-migrated with proteins in outer membrane extracts of a. actinomycetemcomitans, but the outer membrane preparations possessed polypeptides that were not detected in vesicles. three vesicle proteins were identified; the heat-modifiable ompa homologue of a. actinomycetemcomitans, a 28 kda lipoprotein  related to the major outer membrane lipoprotein of mannheimia haemolytica and leukotoxin. incubation of leukotoxin-sensitive human hl60 cells with vesicles from a. actinomycetemcomitans strains jp2 and 652 resulted in cell lysis, indicating that vesicle-associated leukotoxin is biologically active. vesicles from the highly leukotoxic strain jp2 were five- to 10-fold more toxic than vesicles from the minimally leukotoxic 652 strain. furthermore, the specific leukotoxic activity of jp2 vesicles was approximately four- to five-fold higher than isolated outer membrane preparations from jp2, suggesting that vesicles are  enriched in leukotoxin. together, these results suggest that the formation of a.  actinomycetemcomitans vesicles occurs by a process that results in the enrichment of leukotoxin.

TI  == leukotoxins of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == leukotoxins are a group of exotoxins that produce their primary toxic effects against leukocytes, especially polymorphonuclear cells (pmns). leukotoxins include a variety of chemicals ranging from 9,10-epoxy 12-octadecenoate, a fatty  acid derivative secreted by leukocytes themselves, to proteins such as rtx (repeats in toxin). this review focuses on leukotoxins of three species of gram-negative bacteria, mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium necrophorum.
