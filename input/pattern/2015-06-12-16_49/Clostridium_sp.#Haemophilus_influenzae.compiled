TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - The Helicobacter pylori ureC gene codes for a phosphoglucosamine mutase.
AB  - The function of UreC, the product of a 1,335-bp-long open reading frame upstream  from the urease structural genes (ureAB) of Helicobacter pylori, was investigated. We present data showing that the ureC gene product is a phosphoglucosamine mutase. D. Mengin-Lecreulx and J. van Heijenoort (J. Biol. Chem. 271:32-39, 1996) observed that UreC is similar (43% identity) to the GlmM protein of Escherichia coli. Those authors showed that GlmM is a phosphoglucosamine mutase catalyzing interconversion of glucosamine-6-phosphate into glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is subsequently transformed into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The latter product is one of the main cytoplasmic precursors of cell wall peptidoglycan and outer membrane lipopolysaccharides. The present paper reports that, like its E. coli homolog glmM, the H. pylori ureC gene is essential for cell growth. It was known that growth of a lethal conditional glmM mutant of E. coli at a nonpermissive temperature can be restored in the presence of the ureC gene. We showed that complete complementation of the glmM mutant can be obtained with a plasmid overproducing UreC. The peptidoglycan content and the specific phosphoglucosamine mutase activity of such a complemented strain were measured; these results demonstrated that the ureC gene product functions as a phosphoglucosamine mutase. Homologs of the UreC and GlmM proteins were identified in Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium leprae, Clostridium perfringens, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, and Methanococcus jannaschii. Significant conservation of the amino acid sequence of these proteins in such diverse organisms suggests a very ancient common ancestor for the genes and defines a consensus motif for the phosphoglucosamine mutase active site. We propose renaming the H. pylori ureC gene the glmM gene.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - Coloradocin, an antibiotic from a new Actinoplanes. I. Taxonomy, fermentation and biological properties.
AB  - Coloradocin was discovered in a screen for anti-anaerobe activity. The producing  organism was determined to be a new species of Actinoplanes, designated Actinoplanes coloradoensis sp. nov. Coloradocin inhibits Bacteroides, Clostridium and other anaerobes. It does not inhibit most aerobic bacteria but is effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae. Coloradocin has low acute toxicity.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Aetiology and treatment of acute bacterial infection of the external eye.
AB  - The microbial flora of 738 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal  ulceration, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, and discharging sockets has been investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the main pathogens isolated. Str. viridans was associated with conjunctivitis in patients aged under 1 year. moraxella sp. was isolated on only one occasion. Overall, 40% of specimens were associated with Staph. epidermidis or mixed skin flora, which also occurred with cultures of the normal eye. Clostridium welchii was isolated on 3 occasions but was not associated with bullae or gas gangrene. The least overall resistance, of 6%, was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Gentamicin remains the antibiotic of choice for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Chronic otitis media in children. Microbiological studies.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through the open perforation was performed in 68 children with chronic otitis media. The middle ear aspirate and a swab specimen of the external auditory canal were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Seventy-eight isolates were recovered from the middle ears, 99 from the external ear canals, and 95 were present at both sites. Aerobes only were isolated from 33 patients (48.5%), nine (13.2%) had only anaerobes, and 26 (38%) had a culture that grew both aerobes and anaerobes. There were 99 aerobic isolates. Aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. There were 74 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobes commonly isolated were anerobic Gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides sp, and Clostridium sp. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of chronic otitis media in children. Cultures collected from the external auditory canals prior to their sterilization can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudates when collected through the open perforation in the tympanic membrane.
