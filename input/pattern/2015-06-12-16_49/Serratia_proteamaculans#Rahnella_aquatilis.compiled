TI  - The spoilage characteristics of Brochothrix thermosphacta and two psychrotolerant Enterobacteriacae in vacuum packed lamb and the comparison between high and low pH cuts.
AB  - The spoilage potential of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Serratia proteamaculans and  Rahnella aquatilis was investigated in vacuum packaged high (5.9 to 6.4) and low (5.4 to 5.8) pH lamb. Vacuum packaged fore shank (m. extensor carpi radialis) and striploins (m. longissimus dorsi) (n=306) inoculated with ~100 CFU of individual bacteria were stored for twelve weeks at temperatures -1.5, 0, 2 and 7 degrees C. Spoilage characteristics and bacterial numbers were recorded and analysed in comparison to un-inoculated control samples. All three bacterial species were shown to grow in vacuum packaged lamb of pH values between 5.4 and 6.4, when stored at chilled temperatures (-1.5 to 7 degrees C) for up to 84 days. B. thermosphacta and S. proteamaculans caused spoilage to the meat under these conditions whilst R. aquatilis spoiled high pH meat at 7 degrees C. These results go against previous beef models stipulating that Brochothrix and Enterobacteriacae species cannot grow on or cause spoilage of low pH meat in the absence of oxygen.
TI  - Predominant enterobacteria on modified-atmosphere packaged meat and poultry.
AB  - Enterobacteria on modified-atmosphere (MA) packaged meat (n = 54) and poultry (n  = 32) products were enumerated, and 899 isolates were picked and ribotyped. For identification, 16S rRNA genes of representative strains were sequenced and analyzed. Altogether 54 (60%) of the samples contained enterobacteria >10(4) CFU/g. In 34% of the poultry samples, enterobacteria counts were >10(6) CFU/g suggesting that enterobacteria may contribute to spoilage of MA packaged poultry. The enterobacteria identified were predominantly Hafnia spp. (40%) and Serratia spp. (42%) with Hafnia alvei, Hafnia paralvei, Serratia fonticola, Serratia grimesii, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia proteamaculans, and Serratia quinivorans being the species identified. In addition, 6% of the isolates were identified as Rahnella spp., 3% as Yersinia spp., and 1% as Buttiauxella spp. Percentage distributions of the predominant genera in different products showed that 89% of the Serratia spp. were from products packaged under a high-O2 MA containing CO2 (25-35%), whereas most (76%) isolates of Hafnia originated from anaerobically packaged red meat and poultry. These findings suggest that the gas mixture used for MA packaging influence the selection of enterobacteria growing on meat and poultry.
