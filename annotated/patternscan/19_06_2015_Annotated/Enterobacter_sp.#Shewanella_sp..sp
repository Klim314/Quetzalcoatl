TI  == [selective-differential nutrient medium "shewanella irhls agar" for isolation of  shewanella genus bacteria].
AB  == aim: development of a selective-differential nutrient medium for isolation of shewanella genus bacteria. materials and methods: 73 strains of shewanella bacteria (s. algae--3, s. baltica--26, s. putrefaciens--44) and 80 strains of 22  other bacteria genera were used. shewanella species were identified by methods and criteria proposed by nozue h. et al., 1992; khashe s. et al., 1998. results:  nutrient media "shewanella irhls agar" for shewanella isolation was developed. medium selective factors: irgazan dp-300 (i). 0.14-0.2 g/l and rifampicin (r) 0.0005-0.001 g/l. shevanella colonies were detected by the production of hydrogen sulfide (h), lipase presence (l), lack of sorbitol fermentation (s). the medium suppressed the growth of hydrogen sulfide producers (salmonella, proteus) and blocked hydrogen sulfide production by citrobacter. growth of escherichia, enterobacter, klebsiella, shigella, staphylococcus, bacillus was also suppressed, analytical sensitivity of the medium was 1-2 cfu/ml for shewanella and stenotrophomonas, aerombnas, serratia genera bacteria. 72 strains of shewanella were isolated from water of neva river in this medium, 91.7 +/- 3.2% of those produced h2s. 1 strain of s. algae was isolated from clinical material. conclusion: the developed media allows to use it in a complex for stenotrophomo-  nas sp., aeromonas sp., serratia sp., citrobactersp. and shewanella bacteria isolation.

TI  == purification of a secreted lectin from andrias davidianus skin and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == a lectin secreted from andrias davidianus skin (adl) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type iii) (psm)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on sephadex g-100 and hplc on tsk gel g3000pwxl. the purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by sds-page and maldi-tof analysis. sds-page showed that the adl protein had a molecular mass of  17 kda. adl produced an 8.5 kda band when examined using sds-page under reducing  conditions. adl agglutinated native and trypsinized human b erythrocytes. the hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as psm and asialo-psm, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. the activity was stable between 4 degrees c and 50 degrees c. significant adl activity was observed between ph 4-5. the lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation ca2+ or mg2+. the n-terminal adl sequence was determined to be vgytvgatpm. the lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and shewanella sp. furthermore, adl showed inhibition activity against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. these findings suggest that adl plays an important role in the innate immunity of a. davidianus on the body surface.

TI  == bioelectricity production using a new electrode in a microbial fuel cell.
AB  == electrode materials play a key role in enhancing the electricity generation in the microbial fuel cell (mfc). in this study, a new material (ti-tio(2)) was used as an anode electrode and compared with a graphite electrode for electricity generation. current densities were 476.6 and 31 ma/m(2) for ti-tio(2) and graphite electrodes, respectively. the pcr-dgge analysis of enriched microbial communities from estuary revealed that mfc reactors were dominated by shewanella  haliotis, enterococcus sp., and enterobacter sp. bioelectrochemical kinetic works in the mfc with ti-tio(2) electrode revealed that the parameters by non-linear curve fitting with the confidence bounds of 95% gave good fit with the kinetic constants of eta (difference between the anode potential and anode potential giving one-half of the maximum current density) = 0.35 v, k (s) (half-saturation  constant) = 2.93 mm and j (max) = 0.39 a/m(2) for t = 298 k and f = 96.485 c/mol-e(-). from the results observed, it is clear that ti-tio(2) electrode is a  promising candidate for electricity generation in mfc.

TI  == coastal seawater bacteria harbor a large reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance determinants in jiaozhou bay, china.
AB  == diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of jiaozhou bay, china. five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by pcr  amplification, including qnra3 gene in a shewanella algae isolate, qnrb9 gene in  a citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrd gene in 22 proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrs1  gene in 1 enterobacter sp. and 4 klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrs2 gene in 1 pseudomonas sp. and 4 pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. the qnrc, aac(6')-ib-cr, and qepa genes could not be detected in this study. the 22 qnrd-positive proteus  vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on eric-pcr assay. the qnrs1 and qnrd genes could be transferred to escherichia coli j53 azi(r) or e. coli top10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the qrdrs of gyra protein (ala67ser, ser83ile, or ser83thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(cmy), bla(oxy), bla(shv), and bla(tem) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrb9 or qnrs1 gene. our current study is the first identification of qnrs2 gene in pseudoalteromonas and pseudomonas strains, and qnrd gene in proteus vulgaris strains. high prevalence of diverse qnr genes in jiaozhou bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.

TI  == potential application of extracts from indian almond (terminalia catappa linn.) leaves in siamese fighting fish (betta splendens regan) culture.
AB  == indian almond (terminalia catappa linn.) leaves with green and red coloration were tested for bactericidal activity with pathogenic bacteria and their acute toxicity to siamese fighting fish (betta splendens regan). powder of indian almond leaves was extracted with water at the ratio of 1:10 (w/v) and then freeze-dried to a dry powder. bactericidal efficacy was tested against 28 isolates of pathogenic bacteria (aeromonas hydrophila, edwardsiella tarda, enterobacter spp., plesiomonas shigelloides, pseudomonas spp., shewanella putrefaciens, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.) isolated from siamese fighting fish. a paper disc diffusion method was tested on mueller hinton agar (mha) by inoculating 1 x 106 cfu/ml of each bacterial suspension. paper disks (5  mm) were impregnated with either 10 microl of green or red indian almond leaf extract at a concentration of 12,000 ppm, then laid on the surface of the mha. the results revealed that aqueous extract of red indian almond leaves could inhibit the growth of tested bacteria better than the green extract. the minimal  inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined. extracts of green and red leaves were diluted in mueller hinton broth (mhb) to obtain a starting extract concentration of 6,000 ppm then twofold serially diluted in a 96-well microtitre plate. the pathogenic bacteria were inoculated into each well at a density of 1 x 105 cfu/ml and incubated at 35 degrees c for 24 h. the growth of bacteria was detected by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliium bromide. the mic of the red leaf extract ranged from 187.5 to 375 ppm which was lower than for green leaf extract (375-750 ppm). the mbc range of the red leaf extract was 375-750 ppm which was lower than for the green leaf extract (750-1,500 ppm). acute toxicity tests (96-h lc50) of indian almond green and red leaf water extracts in siamese fighting fish were conducted. a logarithmic-spaced series of indian almond leaf extract concentrations (6 concentrations) between the highest concentration that  did not kill fish and the lowest concentration that killed all fish were used. each concentration had three replicates (20 fish/replication). mortality was observed after 96 hours. the lc50 value was calculated using probit analysis. the 96-h lc50 value for green and red leaf extracts was 1,765.69 and 1,651.21 ppm, respectively. when siamese fighting fish were cultured in water added with indian almond water extract at 5 concentrations for 5 days and then challenged with aeromonas hydrophila at a concentration of 1 x 106 cfu/ml, the survival rate of the siamese fighting fish infected by a. hydrophila could be decreased by bathing with indian almond red leaf extract at 750 ppm while green leaf indian almond extract was effective for aeromonad septicemia therapy in siamese fighting fish when used at a concentration of 1,000 ppm. in conclusion, red leaf indian almond  aqueous extract had high potential for the control of pathogenic bacteria at a concentration of 750 ppm which should be safe for siamese fighting fish taking into consideration the toxic level of the extract.

TI  == culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the bacterial community structure from the intestinal tracts of earthworms(eisenia fetida).
AB  == the bacterial communities in the intestinal tracts of earthworm were investigated by culture-dependent and - independent approaches. in total, 72 and 55 pure cultures were isolated from the intestinal tracts of earthworms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. aerobic bacteria were classified as aeromonas (40%), bacillus (37%), photobacterium (10%), pseudomonas (7%), and shewanella (6%). anaerobic bacteria were classified as aeromonas (52%), bacillus (27%), shewanella (12%), paenibacillus (5%), clostridium (2%), and cellulosimicrobium (2%). the dominant microorganisms were aeromonas and bacillus species under both  aerobic and anaerobic conditions. in all, 39 dna fragments were identified by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis. aeromonas sp. was the dominant microorganism in feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms. the dgge band intensity of aeromonas from feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms was 12.8%, 14.7%, and 15.1%, respectively. the other strains identified were bacillus, clostridium, enterobacter, photobacterium, pseudomonas, shewanella, streptomyces, uncultured chloroflexi bacterium, and uncultured bacterium. these results suggest that pcr-dgge analysis was more efficient than the culture-dependent approach for the  investigation of bacterial diversity and the identification of unculturable microorganisms.

TI  == sensorial and microbial effects of gaseous ozone on fresh scad (trachurus trachurus).
AB  == the bactericidal activity of gaseous ozone was investigated using a commercial ozone generator. five species of fish bacteria, pseudomonas putida, shewanella putrefaciens, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterobacter sp. and lactobacillus plantarum, were inoculated on agar surfaces and exposed to different ozonation times in a gas chamber. results showed ozone in relatively low concentrations (<  0.27 x 10(-3) g l-1) was an effective bactericide of vegetative cells of the five fish bacteria. the age of the cell culture was shown to influence the cell response following exposure. survival rate was not linearly related to ozonation  time, but exhibited biphasic death over an extended period. similar bactericidal  effects were observed on fish skin treated with ozone daily in the laboratory, with decreases of 1.0 log cfu cm-2 for the micro-organisms studied. whole fish treated daily in the laboratory using a commercial ozone generator showed improved scores for sensory analyses compared with the controls. the results were statistically significant. fish treated on board ships were also analysed for microbiological and sensory changes. controls were obtained from a similar vessel without the ozone facility in the hold. similar trends to those recorded in the laboratory for the microbiological and sensory results on ozonated fish were observed.
