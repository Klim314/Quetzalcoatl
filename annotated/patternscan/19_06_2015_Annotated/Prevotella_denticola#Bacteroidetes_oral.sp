TI  == periimplant bacteria associated with different transmucosal designs or smoking habits.
AB  == purpose: this study is to compare periimplant microbiota associated with implant  transmucosal designs or smoking habits. methods: submucosal samples from healthy  52 implants were collected for analysis of bacteria associated with bone-level (n = 37) or tissue-level (n = 15) implants or smoking habits, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. profiles of periimplant bacteria of smokers (n = 5) were investigated using phylochip array version g3 and compared with nonsmokers (n = 5). results: the number of bone-level implants positive for at least 1 pathogen was higher than that of tissue level; however, differences in each bacterium were insignificant. the prevalence and abundance of treponema denticola in smokers were significantly higher than that in nonsmokers (p < 0.05). smokers  and nonsmokers exhibited similar periimplant microbiota based on the phylochip array, but they could be distinguished by limiting observations to only 18 operational taxonomic units. streptococcus macedonicus within firmicutes and prevotella within bacteroidetes were more abundant in smokers compared with nonsmokers. conclusion: prevalence of putative pathogens with bone-level implants was higher than tissue-level implants in nonsmokers. firmicutes and bacteroidetes were significantly higher in smokers. smoking therefore strongly influenced peri-implant bacterial composition of bone-level implant.

TI  == comparison of bacterial culture and 16s rrna community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  == culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. a consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16s rrna genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects  with active caries. samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. a diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera prevotella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, and streptococcus. the five most abundant species were: lactobacillus gasseri, prevotella denticola, alloprevotella tannerae, s. mutans and streptococcus sp. hot 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of prevotella species. the different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387r was used. all of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of actinobacteria compared to culture. pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than  the clonal analysis. pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of actinobacteria compared to culture.

TI  == general immune status and oral microbiology in patients with different forms of periodontitis and healthy control subjects.
AB  == objective: immunological processes in the etiopathogenesis of periodontitis, especially the aggressive form, are not well understood. this study examined clinical as well as systemic immunological and local microbiological features in  healthy controls and patients with different forms of periodontitis. materials and methods: 14 healthy subjects, 15 patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis, and 11 patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited. periodontal examination was performed and peripheral blood was collected from each patient. lymphocyte populations as well as the release of cytokines by t-helper cells were determined by flow cytometry and enzyme linked immunosorbent  spot assay. subgingival plaque samples were taken from each individual and immediately cultivated for microbiological examination. results: when stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) with lipopolysaccharide, a higher il-1beta release was found in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis compared to the other groups (p<0.01). numbers of b-cells, naive and transitional b-cells, memory b-cells, and switched memory b-cells were within the reference range for all groups, but patients with chronic periodontitis showed the highest  percentage of memory b-cells without class switch (p = 0.01). the subgingival plaque differed quantitatively as well as qualitatively with a higher number of gram-negative anaerobic species in periodontitis patients. prevotella denticola was found more often in patients with aggressive periodontitis (p<0.001) but did  not show an association to any of the systemic immunological findings. porphyromonas gingivalis, which was only found in patients with moderate chronic  periodontitis, seems to be associated with an activation of the systemic immune response. conclusion: differences between aggressive periodontitis and moderate chronic periodontitis are evident, which raises the question of an inadequate balance between systemic immune response and bacterial infection in aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes identify distinct periodontitis phenotypes.
AB  == the currently recognized principal forms of periodontitis-chronic and aggressive-lack an unequivocal, pathobiology-based foundation. we explored whether gingival tissue transcriptomes can serve as the basis for an alternative  classification of periodontitis. we used cross-sectional whole-genome gene expression data from 241 gingival tissue biopsies obtained from sites with periodontal pathology in 120 systemically healthy nonsmokers with periodontitis,  with available data on clinical periodontal status, subgingival microbial profiles, and serum igg antibodies to periodontal microbiota. adjusted model-based clustering of transcriptomic data using finite mixtures generated two distinct clusters of patients that did not align with the current classification  of chronic and aggressive periodontitis. differential expression profiles primarily related to cell proliferation in cluster 1 and to lymphocyte activation and unfolded protein responses in cluster 2. patients in the two clusters did not differ with respect to age but presented with distinct phenotypes (statistically  significantly different whole-mouth clinical measures of extent/severity, subgingival microbial burden by several species, and selected serum antibody responses). patients in cluster 2 showed more extensive/severe disease and were more often male. the findings suggest that distinct gene expression signatures in pathologic gingival tissues translate into phenotypic differences and can provide a basis for a novel classification.

TI  == subgingival periodontal pathogens associated with chronic periodontitis in yemenis.
AB  == background: subgingival microbial profile associated with periodontitis has been  reported to significantly differ by geographical location. the purpose of this study was to assess the association between a panel of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens and chronic periodontitis among yemenis. methods: subgingival dna samples were obtained from diseased and healthy sites of 20 non-smoking, moderate to severe chronic periodontitis subjects. absolute counts (bacterial dna copies per sample) and relative counts (% total bacteria) of seven periopathogenic species/genera representative of the red and orange complexes were determined using taqman q-pcr assays. results: the q-pcr assays showed excellent linearity (r2 > 0.99) and a sensitivity of 100 copies/sample. the detection rate was 100% for all tested species/genera except for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans that were detected at 97.5% and 67.5%, respectively. the median log absolute counts were in the range of 2.41-6.53 copies per sample while median relative counts were in the range of 0.001-0.77%, both being highest for fusobacteria and lowest for a. actinomycetemcomitans. significant interspecies correlations were observed. adjusting for multiple comparisons (p</=0.0063), only t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. micra maintained significant association with periodontal destruction. the latter species, however, showed the strongest association and was found in higher proportions at the periodontitis sites across all subjects (3.39 median fold increase). no significant differences were observed for p. gingivalis. conclusions: p. micra rather than p. gingivalis  appears as a keystone pathogen in this yemeni sample. however, these findings need to be validated in a larger-scale study before they can be claimed to represent ethnic variations in pathogens' association with periodontitis.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == inter-bacterial correlations in subgingival biofilms: a large-scale survey.
AB  == aim: although the complexity of the oral ecology and the ecological differences between health and disease are well accepted, a clear view on the dynamics in relation to disease is lacking. in this study, the prevalence and abundance of 20 key oral bacteria was assessed in health and disease and more importantly a closer look was given to the inter-bacterial relationships. materials and methods: a blinded microbiological database was analysed in this cross-sectional, retrospective study. the database was constructed based on microbiological analyses of samples from 6308 patients, with gradations of periodontitis (healthy to periodontitis). data concerning the abundance of 20 oral bacteria and probing  pocket depth were provided. results: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas micra and porphyromonas intermedia showed a clear increase in abundance and prevalence with increasing pocket depth. correlation matrices illustrated that almost all microorganisms were in one way correlated to other species and most of these correlations were significant. several beneficial bacteria showed strong correlations with other beneficial bacteria. conclusion: knowledge on bacterial correlations can pave the way for new treatment options focusing on restoring the shifted balance.

TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == periodontopathogen profile of healthy and oral lichen planus patients with gingivitis or periodontitis.
AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == effect of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota over a 2-year monitoring period. i. overall effect and kinetics of change.
AB  == aim: to examine the 2-year post-therapy kinetics of change in the composition of  subgingival biofilms. material and methods: in this study, 178 chronic periodontitis subjects were recruited and clinically monitored at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after therapy. all subjects received scaling and root planing and 156 one or more of periodontal surgery, systemically administered amoxicillin + metronidazole or local tetracycline at pockets >/=5 mm. subgingival biofilm samples taken from each subject at each time point were analysed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the significance of changes in median species counts over time was sought using the wilcoxon or friedman tests and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: mean counts were significantly reduced from baseline to 2 years for 30 of the 40  taxa. marked reductions were observed for periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola and eubacterium nodatum. the kinetics of change differed from species to species. when data were subset according to baseline pd, patterns of change in the microbial profiles were generally similar. conclusion: periodontal therapy leads to a rapid reduction in periodontal pathogens, followed by a slower reduction in other taxa that can be sustained for at least 2 years.

TI  == altered phenotype and function of dendritic cells in individuals with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == detection of oral bacterial dna in synovial fluid.
AB  == objectives: as periodontal bacteria might be involved in the aetiology of rheumatic diseases, we analysed synovial fluid obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and controls for the presence of dna of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. methods: in all, 42 patients suffering from ra (mean age 53.8 +/- 16.7 years, 40.4% females) and 114 controls  with no rheumatic diseases (mean age 56.1 +/- 15.2 years, 52.4% females) were included. dna from synovial fluid was isolated by qiaamp kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) specific for the 16s rrna genes of the above specified bacteria were developed. subgingival bacterial colonization was analysed using micro-ident((r)) test (hain-diagnostik, nehren, germany). results: in patients with ra dna of p. gingivalis was detected in synovial fluid  more often than in controls (15.7% versus 3.5%, p = 0.045). more patients than controls harboured dna from p. gingivalis in both, oral plaque and synovial fluid (11.9% versus. 0.9%, p = 0.030). among the patients group the number of missing teeth was correlated with the number of joints with movement restrictions caused  by ra. conclusions: dna of periodontopathogens can be found in synovial fluid and oral bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens and metabolic control of type 1 diabetes patients.
AB  == objective: the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque collected at different probing depths of type 1 diabetes patients with periodontal disease in correlation to metabolic control. methods: twenty-one patients 40 to 50 years old were included in the study. in each patient blood samples were taken for the evaluation of hba1c level and subgingival plaque samples were taken with paper points from the two deepest pockets. the presence of five periodontal pathogens was detected by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. results: the results of 38 plaque samples showed that  t. forsythia was found in 48% followed by t. denticola in 31%, p. gingivalis in 26%, p. intermedia in 9% and a. actinomycetemcomitans in 7%. t. forsythia and t.  denticola were the most frequent combination of periodontal pathogens found in the same sample. the serum level of hba1c in nine patients where t. forsythia was detected (7.5 +/- 1.4%) was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) than in 12 patients where t. forsythia was not detected (6.8 +/- 0.5%). similarly, the serum level of hba1c was significantly higher (f-test, p = 0.001) in eight patients where t. denticola was detected (7.5 +/- 1.8%) compared to the 13 patients where  t. denticola was not detected (7.0 +/- 0.5%). no such correlation was found for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia or a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: we conclude that t. forsythia and t. denticola are most frequently found in subgingival plaque samples of type 1 diabetic patients and these findings correlate with poorer metabolic control of diabetes.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic effects of lingual cervical coverage by removable partial dentures.
AB  == purpose: the effect of gingival coverage by removable partial dentures (rpds) on  bacterial accumulation has not been sufficiently established. the aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal and microbiologic reactions to mandibular major connectors. it was hypothesized that the use of a lingual plate increases the risk of periodontal disease. materials and methods: fourteen subjects (mean age: 69.0 years) received oral hygiene instructions and ultrasonic debridement prior to examination. each subject received an experimental rpd incorporating either a lingual bar or lingual plate for the first 8 weeks and was then switched to the other option for the next 8 weeks. clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, and tooth mobility) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the periodontal pocket in the test site to measure the colonization of periodontal pathogens after the use of each denture.  results: the mean probing depth was significantly greater after use of the lingual plate compared to the lingual bar (p < .05), whereas the type of connector did not affect the levels of any of the microbial species. all subjects that exhibited at least one bacterial species showed smaller numbers of microorganisms at the second examination than at the first. conclusions: the lingual cervical coverage did not precipitate the accumulation of anaerobic microorganisms, although it could potentially induce gingival inflammation. the results suggest that a lingual plate can be used as safely as a lingual bar if oral and denture hygiene are carefully monitored.

TI  == treponema denticola associates with increased levels of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the aim was to assess the association between the presence of site-specific subgingival micro-organisms and the levels of matrix metalloproteinases-8 and matrix metalloproteinases-9 (mmp-8 and mmp-9) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). materials and methods: the patient group consisted of 56 subjects with periodontitis and the control group of 43 subjects  without periodontitis. gcf samples from four test sites for each subject were collected. polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. mmp-8 concentrations were analyzed by a time-resolved immunofluorometric assay, and mmp-9 levels were  determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. student's unpaired t-test, chi-square test, and fisher's exact p-value were calculated. results: the presence of t. denticola in the test sites was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group. the presence of t. forsythia and t. denticola was associated with increased levels of mmp-8 in the test sites. respectively, site-specific presence of t. denticola was associated with an increase in mmp-9 levels in three of the four test sites. conclusions: the presence of subgingival micro-organisms in gcf, particularly t. denticola, appeared to induce a host response with an increased release of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in the test sites.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == [clinical importance and diagnosis of halitosis].
AB  == the origin of halitosis comes from the latin word "halitus" meaning 'breath, exhaled air', and in the hungarian terminology it means bad and smelly breath. the human body emits a number of volatile molecules, which have a peculiar odour. their presence is influenced by several factors, such as genetic, nutritional and psychological factors. since bad breath belongs to taboo subjects, halitosis can  often lead to social isolation. to determine the incidence of halitosis, an exact diagnosis is needed which sometimes predestinates the possible treatment as well. investigators estimate the incidence about 50% in the whole population. the male/female ratio is the same and the incidence is growing with age. the diagnosis can be genuine halitosis, pseudo halitosis and halitophobia. we can divide the genuine type into physiological and pathophysiological subtypes. the cause of the halitosis usually can be found in the oral cavity. the volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) produced by some of the oral bacteria are responsible for  its development. only 10% of the causes are extraoral, mostly inflammation of airways or gastrointestinal disorders. the judgment of halitosis is based on three objective methods: the organoleptic, the sulphide monitoring and the gas cromatography methods. since the origin of the halitosis is mainly the oral cavity, dentists should treat them. beyond the dental treatments the enhancement  of the oral hygiene, the continuous motivation and monitoring are also very important, such as the use of tongue cleansing and special anti-malodour rinses.

TI  == influence of periodontal status and periodontopathogens on levels of oral human beta-defensin-2 in saliva.
AB  == background: expression patterns of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) mrna or hbd-2 protein concentration and periodontal diseases have been a focus of scientific research. this study compares the salivary levels of hbd-2 protein concentration  of healthy patients and patients with gingivitis and chronic periodontitis (cp) and correlates these levels with the presence of periodontopathogens. methods: a  total of 89 patients were enrolled in this study: 31 periodontally healthy, 27 with gingivitis, and 31 with cp. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and  clinical attachment level were measured. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated qualitatively by conventional polymerase chain reaction. hbd-2 quantification in  saliva was performed using an immune enzymatic assay. frequency of periodontopathogens and hbd-2 protein concentration was assessed. association between hbd-2 protein concentration (>/=100 pg/ml) and the simultaneous presence  of one to two, three to four, or five to six periodontopathogens was tested. results: although periodontally healthy individuals and patients with gingivitis  showed similar hbd-2 levels, the cp group displayed an increased level of hbd-2.  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and t. denticola were more prevalent  in cp; however, their mere presence was not related to the increased levels of hbd-2 (pearson correlation and multinomial logistic regression model). conclusions: salivary hbd-2 protein concentration was higher in patients with cp  compared with healthy individuals or patients with gingivitis. these different protein concentrations were not related to the frequency of periodontopathogens.  clinical inflammatory profile had a higher impact on salivary hbd-2 levels than bacteria.

TI  == frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  == objectives: this study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. design of study: the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). results: the pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). except for p. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). the frequency of p.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). in periodontal samples, t. forsythia and t. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). the frequencies of c. rectus and t. forsythia  were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). the frequency of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). conclusions: bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. there was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == prediction of periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque of periodontal healthy subjects by measurement of volatile sulfur compounds in mouth air.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. for this purpose, we assessed the relationships among  distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and dental plaque, oral conditions including vsc concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. methods: the subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23.5+/-2.56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. after vsc concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (halimeter((r))), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. the tongue coating samples were weighed to determine the amount. the colonization of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in both tongue coating and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. results: significant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and plaque samples, especially that of p. gingivalis. vsc concentration showed the most significant association with  colonization of p. gingivalis in both tongue coating and dental plaque. logistic  regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [exp(b)] values for vsc concentration with the colonization of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35.4 and 10.4, respectively. in addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [exp(b)=6.19, 8.92 and 2.53, respectively]. therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (lr) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. conclusion: the present results demonstrated that measurement of vsc concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque.

TI  == hyaluronic acid as an adjunct after scaling and root planing: a prospective randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: the study is designed to determine the effect on clinical variables,  subgingival bacteria, and local immune response brought about by application of hyaluronan-containing gels in early wound healing after scaling and root planing  (srp). methods: in this randomized clinical study, data from 34 individuals with  chronic periodontitis were evaluated after full-mouth srp. in the test group (n = 17), hyaluronan gels in two molecular weights were additionally applied during the first 2 weeks after srp. the control group (n = 17) was treated with srp only. probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) were recorded at baseline and after 3 and 6 months, and subgingival plaque and sulcus fluid samples were taken for microbiologic and biochemical analysis. results: in both groups, pd and cal were significantly reduced (p <0.001). the changes in pd and the reduction of the number of pockets with pd >/=5 mm were significantly higher  in the test group after 3 (p = 0.014 and 0.021) and 6 (p = 0.046 and 0.045) months. six months after srp, the counts of treponema denticola were significantly reduced in both groups (both p = 0.043), as were those of campylobacter rectus in the test group only (p = 0.028). prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis increased in the control group. conclusion: the adjunctive application of hyaluronan may have positive effects on pd reduction and may prevent recolonization by periodontopathogens.

TI  == the sociodemographic characteristics, periodontal health status, and subgingival  microbiota of patients with chronic periodontitis and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a case-control study in a chinese population.
AB  == background: in china, chronic periodontitis (cp) is common in patients with type  2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm). the purpose of this study is to identify the sociodemographic characteristics associated with such patients and to assess the  periodontal health status and subgingival microbiota of patients with cp and t2dm (t2dmcp) in the chinese population. methods: a total of 150 patients with t2dmcp  and 306 patients with cp without any systemic disease completed questionnaires, underwent clinical periodontal examinations and participated in diabetes-related  parameter examinations. subgingival plaques were obtained to determine the prevalence and amounts of selected oral bacterial species using polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) and real-time pcr, respectively. results: the income level and mean body mass index (bmi) of the patients with t2dmcp were significantly higher  than those of the patients with cp. additionally, the patients with t2dmcp were more likely to be urban residents, and they had significantly more severe periodontitis than did the patients with cp. in the patients with t2dmcp, the prevalence and amounts of treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia were significantly higher than those in the patients with cp. finally, compared with the patients with cp, the patients with t2dmcp had a significantly lower prevalence and amount of prevotella intermedia. conclusions: compared with the patients with cp, the patients with t2dmcp were more likely to be urban residents and generally had higher incomes, higher mean bmi, and poorer periodontal health  status. higher levels of t. denticola and t. forsythia and lower levels of p. intermedia were identified in the subgingival plaque of the patients with t2dmcp.

TI  == a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on the clinical and microbial  effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used by patients in supportive periodontal care.
AB  == aim: this 3-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the  clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control by patients in supportive periodontal care. material and methods: fifty patients were randomly allocated to an essential oil group (listerine((r)) coolmint; johnson & johnson, new brunswick, nj, usa) or placebo group to rinse twice per day as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. at baseline and after 3 months, plaque index (pi), gingivitis index (gi), probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing (bop) and clinical attachment level were registered. subgingival plaque samples were collected for the detection and quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium genus and streptococcus mutans by means of real-time pcr (qpcr). patient's compliance, satisfaction and side effects were registered. results: twenty-three patients in the essential oil group (mean age:  57) and 21 in the placebo group (mean age: 55) with acceptable oral hygiene at intake (mean pi <1.5 on a scale of 5) adhered to the study protocol. gingivitis index, pi and bop significantly reduced over time (p </= 0.029); however, between group analyses revealed no significant differences. there was no significant change over time neither in detection frequency nor load for any of the microbiota. daily rinsing with an essential oil rinse was found safe and perceived beneficial by the patients. conclusion: patients in supportive periodontal care who are fairly compliant with oral hygiene may not benefit from  additional mouth rinsing using an essential oil solution.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB  == background: survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. the primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. methods: a total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical  examination. clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. radiographic bone level was measured around implants. microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. samples were analyzed with dna-dna hybridization including 40 species.  statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon signed-rank tests, mcnemar tests, and spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. results: mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and t. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for parvimonas micra, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and treponema denticola. total dna count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). no correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. conclusions: in the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.

TI  == association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, red-complex periodontopathogens and gingival crevicular fluid cytokine levels with cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth in renal transplant patients.
AB  == backgroud and objective: genetic factors may influence the colonization of pathogenic bacteria, therefore increasing the risk for the initiation and development of periodontal disease. the present study was carried out to investigate the association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, subgingival microbiota, and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) cytokine levels with cyclosporine a (csa)-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant patients. material and methods: a total of 204 patients were dichotomized into two groups: 124 with go and 80 without go. the cd14-260 polymorphisms were measured using an allele-specific pcr method. the levels of periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time pcr of subgingival samples. gcf levels of il-1beta and scd14 were detected by elisa. results: the frequency of cd14-260 genotype ct + tt was found  to be similar in both groups. patients with go presented increased prevalence of  pg, td, and tf (red complex) and significantly higher levels of interleukin -1beta than those without go. patients with go carrying ct + tt genotypes were found to have higher frequencies of pg, td, and tf than those carrying the cc genotype. furthermore, in the presence of red complex, ct + tt genotypes were associated with higher interleukin -1beta levels and severe go. multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the severity of go is not dependent on age, gender and pharmacological variables, being only associated with cd14-260 genotype and red complex periodontopathogens. conclusion: no association between  cd14-260 polymorphisms and the prevalence of go was revealed in renal transplant  patients administered csa. however, cd14-260 ct + tt genotypes are associated with the prevalence of red complex periodontopathogens in patients with go, and may thus play some role in the development of severe csa-induced go.

TI  == insights into the virulence of oral biofilms: discoveries from proteomics.
AB  == this review covers developments in the study of polymicrobial communities, biofilms and selected areas of host response relevant to dental plaque and related areas of oral biology. the emphasis is on recent studies in which proteomic methods, particularly those using mass spectrometry as a readout, have  played a major role in the investigation. the last 5-10 years have seen a transition of such methods from the periphery of oral biology to the mainstream,  as in other areas of biomedical science. for reasons of focus and space, the authors do not discuss biomarker studies relevant to improved diagnostics for oral health, as this literature is rather substantial in its own right and deserves a separate treatment. here, global gene regulation studies of plaque-component organisms, biofilm formation, multispecies interactions and host-microbe interactions are discussed. several aspects of proteomics methodology that are relevant to the studies of multispecies systems are commented upon.

TI  == comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: this clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [lpss]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating lps contents with clinical/radiographic findings. in addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. methods: samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. the limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16s rdna) was used for bacterial investigation. results: endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 eu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively (p < .05). the median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly  higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (p < .05). a positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (p < .05). prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. p. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). conclusions: teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.

TI  == pattern of distribution of prevotella species/phylotypes associated with healthy  gingiva and periodontal disease.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to obtain diverse profiles of prevotella species associated with gingival sites in an isolated aboriginal and an urban community by phylogenetic analysis and to establish patterns of association of identified prevotella species in gingival sites. species/phylotypes identified from the phylogenetic analysis of near full-length bacteroidetes 16s rrna gene sequences cloned from subgingival plaque samples obtained from an aboriginal community were compared with those from an ethnically diverse urban metropolitan  population suffering from periodontal disease. specific primer sets were designed and validated for 22 distinct prevotella species from the 24 species/phylotypes identified from both populations. within the isolated aboriginal community, gingival sites in adults were colonised by a mean of 15 different prevotella species. prevotella sp. oral clone p4pb24, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, prevotella denticola and prevotella sp. strain p4p62 had the highest association with increasing probing depth in diseased sites (p < 0.05). p. intermedia and prevotella sp. oral clone p4pb24, the prevotella species significantly associated with increasing probing depth in diseased gingival sites and also strongly associated with p. gingivalis load (p < 0.05) in diseased gingival sites, showed significant correlation for co-colonisation (r = 0.6). prevotella sp. oral clone b31fd, showing strong association with p. gingivalis load (p < 0.05) in diseased gingival sites, showed no significant correlation for co-colonisation with any other prevotella species. this study provides a comprehensive analysis of prevotella species associated with gingival sites for the informative evaluation of the epidemiology of infection by this genus.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI  == alveolar bone loss associated with age-related macular degeneration in males.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to examine the relationship of selected systemic and oral health parameters and the salivary presence of six periodontal  pathogens to age-related macular degeneration (amd). methods: the present cross-sectional study includes data on 1,751 individuals (>/=30 years old). general health information was obtained by questionnaires and interviews, including self-reported diagnosis of amd, as well as by the general and oral health examination, including panoramic radiography and laboratory analyses. fifty-four individuals with degenerative fundus changes formed the amd group, and the other 1,697 formed the non-amd group. pearson chi(2) and analysis of variance tests were used for comparisons of categorical parameters and continuous parameters between the participant groups, respectively. a logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association of amd with alveolar bone loss and the number of teeth by controlling for age, diabetic status, systolic blood pressure, education, and smoking, and also for the carriage of salivary bacteria. results: advanced age, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes were associated with amd (p <0.001), whereas the carriage rates of the examined periodontal pathogens  were not. in the whole study population, the participants with amd had fewer teeth (p <0.001) and more alveolar bone loss (p = 0.004) compared with non-amd participants. in a logistic regression model adjusted for age, smoking, and diabetes, alveolar bone loss was associated with amd in males with an odds ratio  of 4.3 (95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 14.6, p = 0.013). conclusion: in this population-based health survey, alveolar bone loss is independently associated with amd in males.

TI  == regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with or without systemic doxycycline. a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == aim: comparison of regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with and without administration of postsurgical systemic doxycycline (doxy). methods: in each of 61 patients one infrabony defect was treated with enamel matrix derivative (emd), emd plus filler or membrane at two centres. by random assignment patients received either 200 mg doxy per day or placebo (plac) for 7 days after surgery. prior to and 6 months after surgery probing pocket depths (ppd) and vertical attachment level (pal-v) were obtained. results: fifty-four patients (doxy: 27; plac: 27) were re-examined after 6 months and had been treated exclusively with emd. seven to 8 days after surgery 81% of defects in both groups showed complete  flap closure. in both groups significant (p < 0.001) ppd reduction (doxy: 3.87 +/- 1.44 mm; plac: 3.67 +/- 1.30 mm) and pal-v gain (doxy: 3.11 +/- 1.50 mm; plac: 3.32 +/- 1.83 mm) were observed. however, the differences failed to be statistically significant (ppd: 0.20; p = 0.588; pal-v: 0.21; p = 0.657). conclusions: two hundred milligram systemic doxy administered for 7 days after therapy of infrabony defects with emd failed to result in better ppd reduction and pal-v gain compared with plac which may be due to low power (50%) and, thus,  random chance.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  == background and objective: the dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. this study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. material and methods: four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six labrador retrievers. the samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. from the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. each of the strains was characterized by gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic  growth and api-zym test. eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on dna sequencing technology. cross-reactions of dna probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. results: thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. they represented 21 different species,  of which six belonged to the genus porphyromonas. no species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. porphyromonas crevioricanis and fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. dna probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. conclusion: the predominant cultural subgingival flora in  dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.

TI  == colonisation of the oral cavity by periodontopathic bacteria in complete denture  wearers.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health around zirconia and titanium  abutments: an in vivo study in man.
AB  == aim: to compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (zro(2)) and titanium (ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. materials and methods: twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. the implants were fitted with either a zro(2) or a ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right  randomization). sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket  depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the zro(2) and ti abutments, at the two observation time points. results: zro(2) and ti abutments harboured similar counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. healthy clinical conditions were seen around both zro(2) and ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. mean probing depths around ti abutments were slightly deeper than around  zro(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 sd 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 sd 0.7 mm, p=0.03). conclusions: no difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to zro(2) and ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around zro(2) abutments  after 3 month.

TI  == effect of khat chewing on periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm from chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == aims: existing in vitro and in vivo data suggest that khat may have a favorable effect on periodontal microbiota. the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of khat chewing on major periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from subjects with chronic periodontitis. materials and methods: 40 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from periodontitis and healthy sites of  10 khat chewers (40 y median age) and 10 khat non-chewers (37.5 y median age) with chronic periodontitis. absolute and relative counts of 6 periodontal pathogens were determined in each sample using highly sensitive and specific taqman real-time pcr assays. data were analyzed using an ordinal regression model. results: significantly more total bacteria were detected in samples from the periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=20). treponema denticola was present at significantly higher absolute counts at the healthy as well as periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=3.13 and 13, respectively). however,  the khat chewers harbored significantly lower absolute counts of porphyromonas gingivalis at the healthy sites (or=0.07). furthermore, khat chewing was significantly associated with lower relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis,  fusobacterium ssp., prevotella ssp. and parvimonas micra-like species in subgingival plaque samples from both healthy and periodontitis sites (or=0.11-0.33). only treponema denticola was found in higher relative counts at the healthy sites of the khat chewers (or=2.98). conclusions: overall, there was  a lower burden of pathogens in the khat chewers. findings from the current study  are suggestive of a potential prebiotic effect for khat on periodontal microbiota.

TI  == characterization of the normal bacterial flora in peri-implant sulci of partially and completely edentulous patients.
AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

TI  == photodynamic therapy in periodontal therapy: microbiological observations from a  private practice.
AB  == in recent years, the combination of laser light and photosensitizer known as photodynamic therapy (pdt) has been used in periodontal therapy. however, there are not enough clinical studies to fully evaluate the effects of pdt on the periodontal tissues. this microbiological study examined the effects of pdt on the periodontal bacteria in combination with scaling and root planing (srp) in the same group of patients by randomly selecting pdt or srp for use in different  quadrants of the mouth. for the present study, pdt was compared with a diode laser (980 nm) and an nd:ya g laser (1,064 nm). microbiological samples were examined and evaluated over a period of three months. significant bacterial reduction has been observed in all cases. the diode laser with srp presented long-term positive results, while pdt showed a significant bacteria reduction during the entire observation period.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI  == photodynamic therapy of persistent pockets in maintenance patients-a clinical study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

TI  == salivary interleukin-1beta concentration and the presence of multiple pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  == aim: this study aimed to find salivary enzymes and/or cytokines that would reflect periodontitis, alone or in combination with salivary microbial markers. material and methods: the salivary concentrations of elastase, lactate dehydrogenase, interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and the presence of five periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, were analysed from salivary specimens of 165 subjects, a subpopulation of health 2000 health examination survey in finland; 84 of the subjects had probing pocket depth (ppd) of > or =4 mm at 14 or more teeth (the advanced periodontitis group), while 81 subjects had  no teeth with ppd of > or =4 mm (the control group). all subjects had at least 20 teeth and no systemic diseases. results: among the salivary cytokines and enzymes tested, il-1beta was the only biomarker associated with periodontitis. an association was also found with the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens. salivary il-1beta and the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens were associated with periodontitis at the same magnitude, when they were in the logistic regression model individually or together. conclusion: we suggest that salivary il-1beta and the presence of multiple periodontal pathogens in saliva should be studied more thoroughly as markers of periodontitis.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == one-stage full-mouth versus partial-mouth scaling and root planing during the effective half-life of systemically administered azithromycin.
AB  == background: one-stage full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) in combination with systemically administered azithromycin was shown to be clinically and bacteriologically effective in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. however, fm-srp requires 2 hours for completion. azithromycin has a long half-life. therefore, if srp of the full mouth is performed within 7 days while an effective concentration of azithromycin remains in the gingiva, the effects may be the same as fm-srp. the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and bacteriologic effects of fm-srp and partial-mouth scaling and root planing (pm-srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis, which was performed in three sessions within 7 days,  during the effective half-life of systemically administrated azithromycin. methods: thirty adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into three groups (fm-srp, pm-srp, and control). a clinical examination was conducted to record the probing depth, clinical attachment level gain, bleeding on probing, gingival index, and volume of gingival crevicular fluid; bacterial samples were obtained before treatment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter.  quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using the polymerase chain reaction-invader method. results: all clinical parameters showed better improvement in fm-srp and pm-srp groups compared to the control group, with no significant differences between the two test groups. periodontal bacteria were well controlled in the two test groups, but they tended to increase gradually 3 months after treatment in the control group. conclusion: pm- and fm-srp demonstrated comparable clinical and bacteriologic results.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and the hla-dqb1 allele are associated with susceptibility to periodontal disease in japanese adolescents.
AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == persistence of extracrevicular bacterial reservoirs after treatment of aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == treatment outcomes of dental flossing in twins: molecular analysis of the interproximal microflora.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == relationship of porphyromonas gingivalis with glycemic level in patients with type 2 diabetes following periodontal treatment.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum  glycemic levels and subgingival microbial profile alteration following periodontal treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. methods: we studied 30 periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received full-mouth subgingival debridement by analyzing their subgingival microbial profiles using a polymerase chain reaction method at baseline and various time-points for 12 months following treatment. concurrently, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and metabolic parameters, including glycated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), blood sugar level, c-reactive proteins, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were recorded. results: periodontal conditions were significantly improved after treatment, and the occurrence rates of periodontal bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia, were also reduced. interestingly, p. gingivalis was detected more frequently in subjects with increased hba1c values after periodontal treatment than in those patients with decreased hba1c values. furthermore, p. gingivalis with type ii fimbriae was detected only in hba1c-increased subjects, while improvements in hba1c values were observed only in subjects without type ii clones. conclusions: these results suggest that glycemic level in diabetes is affected by the persistence of p. gingivalis, especially clones with type ii fimbriae, in periodontal pockets.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == the reproducibility of curet sampling of subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: because few studies have examined the critical issue of sampling reproducibility, the purpose of the present study was to examine the reproducibility of curet sampling of subgingival biofilms. methods: seven subgingival biofilm samples were taken successively, using a curet, from each of  80 sites and individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. one healthy site was sampled in each of 20 periodontally healthy subjects, and one sulcus/pocket of < or =3, 4 to 5, and  > or =6 mm was sampled in each of 20 subjects with chronic periodontitis. the significance of differences in counts and proportions of individual species at the seven successive samplings for each probing depth (pd) category was determined using the kruskal-wallis test. the reproducibility of species proportions at each pd category was measured using the coefficient of variation (cv), and the consistency of microbial profiles across samples was examined using the minimum similarity coefficient. results: there was no significant difference  in the mean proportions of the 40 test species in the seven successive samples in each of the four pd categories. the median cv for individual species in the same  site was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.76 to 0.82) compared to 1.76 (95%  ci: 1.69 to 1.82) in samples from different sites. the within-site mean minimum similarity coefficient (+/- sem) was 51.2% +/- 2.2%, and it was 27.9% +/- 0.3% between sites. conclusion: the proportions of species remained consistent in successive curet samples, indicating that the use of curets provided a reliable and reproducible method to obtain subgingival samples.

TI  == microbiologic and immunologic characteristics of periodontal disease in hispanic  americans with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == interleukin- 1 gene polymorphisms as assessed in a 10-year study of patients with early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == our 10-year study of early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients includes repeated clinical observations, microbiological characteristics and analysis of genetic polymorphism of il-1a and il-1b genes. twenty patients (age 15-26 years) were divided according to the clinical status in the 4th year into a group with mean number of teeth with bleeding on probing (bp) 9.8 and mean number of teeth with periodontal pocket (pp) 2.23, and a group with mean number of teeth with bp 5.37  and no pp. significantly higher values of mean bp and pp were found among the groups during the study but a strong progression of disease was found only in 3 patients. the risk il-1a allele-2 and il-1b allele-2 genotype and bacterial presence were analyzed by dna hybridization methods. no significant differences of bacteria composition (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were found between the groups. a higher prevalence of composite il-1 genotype was detected in the group of eop patients with progressive disease. early finding of the disease followed by conservative therapy could positively influence the disease progression. eop treated in early  stages may, but need not, develop into the aggressive form in the presence of risk genotype il-1.

TI  == prevalence of four putative periodontopathic bacteria in saliva of a group of brazilian children with mixed dentition: 1-year longitudinal study.
AB  == aim: this study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola) in saliva of children with mixed dentition at two different time points, correlating these findings with a clinical parameter of gingival health. design: polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection was used to determine the prevalence of these bacteria in saliva of 64  children in 2003 and 60 children in 2004. gingival health was assessed by gingival index. result: sixty-two (96.9%) and 50 (83.3%) children presented low gingival inflammation, whereas 2 (3.1%) and 10 (16.7%) had moderate scores in 2003 and 2004, respectively. majority of the children (81.3% in 2003 and 73.3% in 2004) had detectable levels of at least one of the bacteria. the prevalence found was of 4.7% and 1.7% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 6.3% and 8.3% for p. gingivalis, 23.4% and 48.3% for p. nigrescens (p < 0.05), and 71.9% and 50% for t. denticola (p < 0.05) in 2003 and 2004, respectively. no significant relationship between gingival index and presence of these bacteria and combination of different species was found. conclusion: a high percentage of children harboured at least one of the putative periodontal pathogens in saliva,  but presented periodontally healthy conditions.

TI  == the detection of eight putative periodontal pathogens in adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients: an institutional study.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is a commonly prevalent problem faced alike by both  the developed and third world countries but showing wide variations in prevalence and severity across different geographical areas. the purpose was to identify actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), ekinella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), bacteroides forsythus (bf), treponema denticola (td) and fusobacterium nucleatum  (fn) in indian adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: paper points were used to collect the sample from 28 sites in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis (8 healthy/20 diseased sites) patients and dna analysis done. the categorical data was analysed by fishers exact test and difference in the clinical parameters was tested by mann-whitney test. results: in healthy sites of adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients, aa, ec, bf and aa, pg, pi, td, fn were detected respectively. however, when diseased and healthy sites were compared in  both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients respectively, only pg( p =0.004), cr( p =0.04), fn( p =0.014) and pg( p =0.002),  cr( p =0.02), fn( p =0.008) were statistically significant. conclusion: the prevalence of the microorganisms correlate with the clinical parameters like probing depth and bleeding on probing as seen in the japanese and western periodontitis patients' population.

TI  == subgingival chlorhexidine varnish administration as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological observations.
AB  == background: recently, the clinical additive value of a highly concentrated chlorhexidine (chx) varnish, when applied subgingivally as an adjunct to scaling  and root planing, was described. the objective of the present study was to investigate the microbiological impact of a treatment strategy for chronic periodontitis based on a combination of same-day full-mouth root planing and subgingival chx varnish administration. methods: a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel trial was conducted on 33 non-smoking chronic periodontitis patients. the control group received oral hygiene instructions and  same-day full-mouth root planing. the test group received the same instructions and treatment; however, all pockets also were disinfected using a supersaturated  chx varnish. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the deepest site per  quadrant in each patient at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. pooled sample  analysis was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method for the identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola  (td), and prevotella intermedia (pi). results: in terms of detection frequency and bacterial levels, significant, mainly temporary, reductions from baseline were found in both groups. when a comparison was made between the control and the test group, significant differences in the detection frequency of tf (p = 0.024)  and td (p = 0.024), which favored the test group, were found at 1 month. a similar phenomenon was seen for td (p = 0.031) based on bacterial levels. an important trend toward lower tf levels in the test group also was found at 1 month (p = 0.052). compared to baseline levels, microbiological benefits in the test group seemed to be maintained, at least in part, over a 6-month period. in contrast, all microbial levels had relapsed in the control group at study termination. conclusion: the microbiological results of the present study promote the subgingival administration of a highly concentrated chx varnish as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing.

TI  == microbiological outcomes of quadrant versus full-mouth root planing as monitored  by real-time pcr.
AB  == objectives: to study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (fmrp and qrp) as well as long-term effects. method: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (fmrp) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant  in four sessions at intervals of one week (qrp). microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. the samples were  evaluated by real-time pcr for quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (tbc). results: treatment resulted in a tbc median log reduction of 0.75 (fmrp) and 0.72 (qrp). there were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. conclusion: the results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.

TI  == identification of the microorganisms responsible for periodontopathy by multiplex rt-pcr.
AB  == the aim of our research was to identify by bacterial genomic dna analysis the prevalence of five different species of periodontopathogenic bacteria present in  the subgingival biofilm, specifically: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), bacterioides forsytus  (bf), treponema denticola (td). for the analysis we used the systematic multiplex-pcr-microdent kit with species-specific primers. we studied a group of  48 subjects, 18 males and 30 females, from 18 to 78 years of age. the initial clinical screening enabled us to select, among the group analysed, 24 subjects with signs of active periodontopathy (group a) and 24 patients without identifiable clinical evidence of the disease used as the control group (group b). within the two experimental groups (a and b), the test was found to be positive in 75% of subjects from group a, whereas the test was found to be negative in all the subjects from group b. our research shows that the multiplex-pcr system is reliable. furthermore, the sensitivity and simplicity of  this technique, as well as the decrease in working times and the possibility of identifying non-culturable bacteria, since the presence of viable organisms is not essential, make this technique indicated for the simultaneous identification  of periodontopathogenic bacteria and might, in perspective, provide a more effective clinical alternative to the techniques of bacterial typing of the subgingival plaque.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel  using platinum cell technology. the electrolyzed tap water (called puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. in addition, puri-water was used as  a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. it also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin  agar. our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c  on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts  of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with  (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria,  p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.

TI  == proteinase activity of prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection.
AB  == prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens are often regarded as principal causes of acute dentoalveolar infection; however, other species within the genus  are also known to be associated with such infection. the aim of this study was to determine the in vitro proteolytic activity of these different prevotella species that have been implicated with dentoalveolar infection. a total of 234 strains were obtained from pus specimens from dentoalveolar infection and from the plaque of healthy volunteers. prevotella loescheii, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella buccae, and prevotella denticola were all shown to have a proteolytic activity (8.5-10.5 x 10(-8) a-units) lower than that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens (21.1-23.5 x 10(-8) a-units). in the case of p. loescheii, p. melaninogenica, and p. intermedia, the level of proteolytic activity for clinical strains was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that recorded for commensal strains. proteolytic activity for all species of prevotella examined was inhibited by n-ethylmaleimide and phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. this study suggests that prevotella species associated with oral purulent infection produce cysteine and serine proteinases and that in certain species of prevotella, the strains involved in infection exhibit higher proteolytic activity when compared with strains from healthy sites.

TI  == langerhans' cell histiocytosis in a 5-year-old girl: evidence of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: langerhans' cell histiocytosis (lch) is a rare disorder characterized by langerhans' cell proliferation in various organs or tissues. when periodontal  tissue is involved, clinical manifestations can vary from gingival recession and  pocket formation to severe alveolar bone loss. this case report describes periodontal pathogens found in the pockets of involved primary teeth. methods: a  5-year-old girl with lch presented with loose teeth. intraoral examination and radiographs revealed deep pockets and severe bone loss around all primary molars. bacterial samples were obtained from saliva and subgingival plaque and analyzed for the presence of five periodontopathic bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. due to severe periodontal destruction, all primary molars  were extracted, and a gingival biopsy was taken from tooth t to confirm the diagnosis of lch. results: the biopsy specimen revealed the histologic features of lch. the patient was diagnosed as having periodontitis as a manifestation of lch. pcr results of subgingival plaque from lch-affected molars indicated the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was absent from these teeth. no tested bacteria were found  in the non-affected anterior teeth. conclusions: the bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease were detected in subgingival plaque samples from this lch patient. more microbiological data are required to understand the role of these bacteria in lch-associated periodontal destruction.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein vaccine reduces the alveolar bone loss induced by multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: heat shock protein (hsp) can be utilized as a vaccine to cross-protect against multiple pathogenic species. the present study was performed to evaluate porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) as a vaccine candidate to inhibit multiple bacteria-induced alveolar bone loss. material and methods: recombinant p. gingivalis hsp60 was produced and purified from p. gingivalis groel gene. rats were immunized with p. gingivalis hsp60, and  experimental alveolar bone loss was induced by infection with multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria. results: there was a very strong inverse relationship between postimmune anti-p. gingivalis hsp immunoglobulin g (igg) levels and the amount of alveolar bone loss induced by either p. gingivalis or multiple bacterial infection (p=0.007). polymerase chain reaction data indicated  that the vaccine successfully eradicated the multiple pathogenic species. conclusions: we concluded that p. gingivalis hsp60 could potentially be developed as a vaccine to inhibit periodontal disease induced by multiple pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == relationship of periodontal bacteria and porphyromonas gingivalis fima variations with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == objectives: we investigated the relationship between phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth (go) and the harboring of periodontal bacteria. materials and methods: periodontal conditions and subgingival bacterial profiles were examined in 450 sites of 75 subjects. a polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect six bacterial species; porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), and prevotella nigrescens (pn). genetic variations of the pg fima gene were also examined. bacterial occurrence was compared with the severity of go, and alterations in the bacterial occurrence rate and quantities were monitored following periodontal treatment. results: the occurrences of aa, td, pi, pn, and pg with type ii fima (type ii pg) were significantly associated with the severity of go. td occurrence was reduced in association with gingival improvement following ultrasonic scaling, however, no such relationship was observed with aa, pi, pn, and pg. in addition, pg and pi markedly persisted after treatment. clinical improvement of the sites, following an er:yag laser treatment, significantly associated with quantitative reduction of pg in improved sites, however, not that of pi. conclusion: type ii pg and td were each found to  have a significant relationship with the development and deterioration of go.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

AB  == background/aims: the presence of selected bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola) in infected root canals was studied using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, and the association of bacteria with clinical signs of endodontic disease was assessed. the null hypothesis, that no difference could be observed between clinical signs of apical periodontitis and a specific bacterial  strain, was tested. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 62 teeth in 54  patients with endodontic disease. for each tooth, clinical data including patient symptoms were collected. teeth were categorized by diagnosis as having acute apical periodontitis (aap, teeth with clinical symptoms but no periapical radiolucency, n=22), chronic apical periodontitis (cap, teeth with radiolucency but no clinical symptoms, n=15) or exacerbated apical periodontitis (eap, teeth with symptoms and radiolucency, n=25). seventy-one percent of cases were primary  endodontic infections, and 29% were recurrent ('secondary') endodontic infections (failing cases). pcr assays were used to detect the presence of the selected bacteria. results: t. denticola and e. faecalis were each detected in 15 of 62 samples (24%), p. gingivalis in 8 samples (13%), p. intermedia in 5 samples (8%), and t. forsythensis in 4 samples (7%). t. denticola was detected in 56% of teeth  with eap. e. faecalis was found in 60% of teeth with cap and in 72% of teeth with secondary infection. statistical analysis demonstrated an association of cap and  secondary endodontic infection with the presence of e. faecalis. (p<0.01). eap was associated with the presence of t. denticola (p<0.01). conclusion: t. denticola was associated with symptomatic endodontic disease in the presence of apical bone resorption. e. faecalis was associated with treatment failures. we suggest that these species may play critical roles in endodontic pathology.

TI  == prevotella multiformis sp. nov., isolated from human subgingival plaque.
AB  == four bacterial strains isolated from the human oral cavity, pppa19, pppa21(t), pppa28 and pppa30, were characterized by determining phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles and the phylogenetic position based on 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed that each of  the isolates was a member of the genus prevotella. these strains were related to  prevotella denticola with about 95 % similarity. the strains were obligately anaerobic, non-pigmented, non-spore-forming, non-motile, gram-negative rods. however, the cells of these strains were often cocci (coccobacilli), depending on the cultivation time. colonies of different sizes were detected on eggerth gagnon agar plates for these strains. the cells forming large colonies were cocci, whereas those forming small colonies were cocci and rods. however, 16s rrna gene  sequence comparison of colonies of different sizes revealed that only a single organism was present. although these strains had phenotypic characteristics that  were similar to those of p. denticola jcm 8528, they could be differentiated from p. denticola jcm 8528 by aesculin hydrolysis and d-cellobiose fermentation in api 20a tests. dna-dna hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinction of  these four strains with respect to p. denticola jcm 8528. on the basis of these data, a novel prevotella species, prevotella multiformis sp. nov., is proposed, with pppa21(t) (=jcm 12541(t)=dsm 16608(t)) as the type strain.

TI  == detection of dna from periodontal pathogenic bacteria in biofilm obtained from waterlines in dental units.
AB  == direct person-to-person transmission of periodontal bacteria through saliva has recently been widely reported and dental units have been demonstrated to retract  saliva from patients under treatment and to release it into the mouths of subjects undergoing the next operation. in this study the presence of a group of  periodontal pathogenic bacteria inside waterlines in dental units was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based methods. briefly, 18 dental units of three different manufacturers were studied. dental units were divided into two groups according to their prevalent use in routine practice. the first group consisted of nine dental units characterized by the frequent use of high-speed dental hand-pieces directly inside the mouth and in contact with patients' saliva. the second group, as a control, consisted of nine dental units  where high-speed dental hand-pieces were not in use. a one cm section of the waterline tubing connected to the high-speed hand-piece was removed from each dental unit to evaluate the presence of dna of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola. two specimens were positive for prevotella intermedia dna. all the positive results were from samples obtained from dental units categorised in the first group. these findings clearly suggest  that dental units have the potential to transmit periodontal pathogens. manufacturers should be invited to design dental units that incorporate automated devices to disinfect duwls between patients with minimal effort by dental staff.

TI  == periodontal diseases: microbiological considerations.
AB  == the location of plaque-associated gingivitis at the gingival portion of the tooth plays an essential role in its genesis. however, at times local and other host response modifying factors also have an influence. the pathogeny of periodontitis is more complex. the microorganisms that comprise subgingival plaque are capable  of acting directly on periodontal tissues or of modifying the host response, whereas the participation of the plaque per se (normal, decreased, or increased)  is as decisive as the action of the bacteria themselves in the emergence of the disease. different types of periodontitis are associated with specific microorganisms. the most periodontopathogenic are a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis. periodontitis as a whole, represent the source of complications such as root caries, endoperiodontal processes and periodontal abscesses. they are associated with various illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and respiratory infections, amongst others, as well as pathological oral halitosis. the different modalities of pcr are particularly important in the microbiological diagnosis of periodontitis, although on the negative side of things, it must be pointed out that in vitro sensitivity studies cannot be performed using this technique. first line antibiotic treatment of periodontitis  includes amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, metronidazole (associated or not with amoxicillin) and clindamycin.

TI  == detection frequency of periodontitis-associated bacteria by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival and supragingival plaque of periodontitis and healthy subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the detection frequencies of 25 bacterial species in subgingival and supragingival plaque of 18 untreated periodontitis subjects and 12 periodontally healthy subjects. genomic dna was extracted from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples, and bacterial detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction of the 16s rrna genes. fourteen bacteria showed no relationship with periodontitis, and 11 of these 14 species were frequently detected (> or =50%) in subgingival plaque in both periodontitis and healthy subjects. nine bacteria such as eubacterium saphenum, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola seemed to be related to periodontitis; their  detection frequencies in subgingival plaque samples were higher in periodontitis  than in healthy subjects, but these differences were not statistically significant by multiple comparisons (0.002< or =p<0.05). two species (mogibacterium timidum and porphyromonas gingivalis) were detected significantly  more frequently in subgingival plaque of periodontitis subjects than of healthy subjects (p<0.002), with p. gingivalis being detected only in periodontitis subjects, suggesting that these two species are closely related to periodontitis. there were no significant differences in the detection frequencies of the 25 bacteria between subgingival and supragingival plaque, suggesting that the bacterial flora of supragingival plaque reflects that of subgingival plaque.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological findings.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that over a period of 6 months, same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) resulted in greater reductions in the detection frequency of five putative periodontal pathogens compared with quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) in chronic periodontitis patients. materials and methods: forty patients were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups. the fm-srp group received full-mouth scaling and root planing completed within the same day, while the q-srp group received quadrant root planing at 2-weekly intervals over four consecutive sessions. selected-site analyses were performed on the deepest site in each quadrant before and after therapy, at approximately 3 and 6 months from baseline (r1 and r2) and clinical indices were recorded with an electronic pressure-sensitive probe. in addition, subgingival plaque samples were collected  from these sites at baseline (bas), at reassessment 1 (r1), approximately 6 weeks after the completion of therapy and at reassessment 2 (r2), 6 months from baseline. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in plaque. results: both therapies resulted in significant improvements in all clinical indices both  at r1 and r2. a marked reduction in the presence of all candidate periodontal pathogens was noted after both treatment modalities, reaching statistical significance for the majority of the test organisms. these improvements were maintained over a period of 6 months. when the two treatment groups were compared, a significantly higher percentage of q-srp patients was positive for p. intermedia at r1 compared with fm-srp patients (p<0.05). in addition, a greater reduction in the patient prevalence for t. denticola was found for the fm-srp group than the q-srp group at r1 and r2 from baseline (p<0.005), but the significance of this is questionable given the skewed detection frequency of this organism at baseline between the two treatments (p<0.01). conclusion: this study  failed to confirm that same-day fm-srp resulted in greater microbiological improvements compared with q-srp at 2-weekly intervals over a 6-month period, as  determined by pcr.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) and quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) resulted in variations in the systemic humoral immune response dynamics (antibody titres and avidity) during active treatment and 3 and 6 months post-therapy. materials and methods: forty patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups and received either scaling and root planing quadrant by quadrant at 2-weekly intervals (q-srp group) or same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp group). clinical measurements and serum samples were obtained at baseline and approximately 6 weeks after the last clinical intervention (r1) and 6 months after the initiation of therapy (r2). furthermore, serum samples were obtained from each patient undergoing therapy (q-srp and fm-srp) at 3 bi-weekly instances so as to determine the short-term effects of each session of scaling and root planing on the dynamics of the humoral immune response. serum antibody titre was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and antibody avidity was measured by thiocyanate dissociation against five putative periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis; actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; prevotella intermedia; treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus. results: both therapies resulted in similar antibody titre reductions against the majority of the organisms tested and although there was a distinct trend for antibody avidity to increase following therapy, this was not found to be statistically significant, reflecting marked inter-individual variation. in addition, no evidence emerged from this study to support increased antibody titres following the active phases of both treatment approaches due to an inoculation effect. nevertheless, significant short-term increases in antibody avidity to most test bacteria were noted for both treatment strategies. conclusion: both therapies were associated with a reduction in antibody titres and an increase in the binding ability or avidity of antibodies, but there was a marked inter-subject variability and statistical significance was reached for only some of the test bacteria. no significant differences in the humoral antibody dynamics were found  between the two treatment approaches.

TI  == accidentally induced periodontitis in primary dentition: longitudinal examinations of periodontal bacteria and clinical conditions.
AB  == periodontitis is very rare in the primary dentition although it can be accidentally induced in young children. the purpose of this study was to describe a case of periodontitis in a 4-year-old child, which was accidentally induced by  insertion of small plastic tubes into the dental cervix of the primary incisors during play, and to discuss the clinical, radiographic, and microbiological findings. removal of the plastic tubes resulted in resolution of the periodontal  condition. prevotella nigrescens and campylobacter rectus were detected in subgingival plaque samples from the affected teeth at every examination, whereas  porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and bacteroides forsythus were never found during the two-year observation period. the clinical and microbiological results suggest that the type of periodontitis caused by such an incidence is not progressive, unlike other periodontal diseases such as prepubertal and juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == new bacterial species associated with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == recent investigations of the human subgingival oral flora based on ribosomal 16s  cloning and sequencing have shown many of the bacterial species present to be novel species or phylotypes. the purpose of the present investigation was to identify potential periodontal pathogens among these newly identified species and phylotypes. species-specific ribosomal 16s primers for pcr amplification were developed for detection of new species. associations with chronic periodontitis were observed for several new species or phylotypes, including uncultivated clones d084 and bh017 from the deferribacteres phylum, au126 from the bacteroidetes phylum, megasphaera clone bb166, clone x112 from the op11 phylum, and clone i025 from the tm7 phylum, and the named species eubacterium saphenum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, and cryptobacterium curtum. species or phylotypes more prevalent in periodontal health included two uncultivated phylotypes, clone w090 from the deferribacteres phylum and clone bu063 from the bacteroidetes, and named species atopobium rimae and atopobium parvulum.

TI  == transmission of periodontal disease-associated bacteria from teeth to osseointegrated implant regions.
AB  == purpose: the presence of periodontopathic bacteria is a risk factor for peri-implantitis. the present study examined colonization by periodontopathic bacteria and their transmission from periodontal pockets to osseointegrated implant sulcus. materials and methods: plaque samples were collected from 105 sites in the 15 patients who participated in the study. colonization by these bacteria was examined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and culture. the transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from periodontal sites of natural teeth to the implant sulcus was analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: the pcr detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola were 80.0%, 53.3%, 46.7%, 60.0% and 40.0%, respectively. colonizations by p gingivalis and a actinomycetemcomitans were statistically correlated with periodontal pockets and implant sulcus regions (p < .01). the pfge patterns of the p gingivalis strains isolated from each patient were identical, but differed from those from other patients. the pfge patterns of p intermedia strains were identical in 2 out of 3 patients. discussion: these analyses indicated that there appeared to be transmission of p gingivalis and p intermedia from the periodontal pocket to the peri-implant region. conclusion: elimination of these periodontal pathogens from the patient's oral cavity before  administering dental implant treatment may inhibit colonization by these pathogens and reduce the risk of peri-implantitis.

TI  == comparison of microbial cultivation and a commercial pcr based method for detection of periodontopathogenic species in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objectives: microbiological laboratory procedures are involved in diagnosis and therapy control of progressive and refractory forms of periodontitis. in recent years techniques have been developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. the purpose of this study was to validate the commercially available micro-dent(r) test which employs probes for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus and t. denticola. methods: 122 plaque samples obtained from periodontal pockets with various depths from 33 early onset periodontitis (eop) patients and 15 periodontally healthy subjects were analysed by cultivation and the microdent(r) kit. results: both cultivation and the nucleic acid based assay showed a positive correlation of pocket depth with the frequency and quantity of periodontopathogenic species. t. denticola was found only in pockets  > 4 mm in eop patients. comparison of the two methods revealed that the microdent(r) kit identified both p. gingivalis and b. forsythus more often than did the cultivation method. conclusions: nucleic acid techniques should replace cultivation methods as gold standard in microbiological diagnosis of progressive  periodontitis. the micro-dent(r) kit can be recommended for microbiological laboratories analysing subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == microbiological findings and host response in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to characterise microbiota and inflammatory host response around implants and teeth in patients with peri-implantitis. we included 17 partly edentulous patients with a total of 98 implants, of which 45 showed marginal bone loss of more than three fixture threads after the first year of loading. nineteen subjects with stable marginal tissue conditions served as controls. oral hygiene, gingival inflammation, and probing pocket depth were evaluated clinically at teeth and implants. microbiological and crevicular fluid  samples were collected from five categories of sites: 1) implants with peri-implantitis (pi), 2) stable implants (si) in patients with both stable and peri-implantitis implants, 3) control implants (ci) in patients with stable implants alone, 4) teeth in patients (tp) and 5) controls (tc). crevicular fluid  from teeth and implants was analysed for elastase activity, lactoferrin and il-1  beta concentrations. elastase activity was higher at pi than at ci in controls. lactoferrin concentration was higher at pi than at si in patients with peri-implantitis. higher levels of both lactoferrin and elastase activity were found at pi than at teeth in patients. the concentrations of il-1 beta were about the same in the various sites. microbiological dna-probe analysis revealed a putative periodontal microflora at teeth and implants in patients and controls. patients with peri-implantitis harboured high levels of periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. these findings indicate a site-specific inflammation rather than a patient-associated specific host response.

TI  == direct quantitative differentiation between prevotella intermedia and prevotella  nigrescens in clinical specimens.
AB  == this paper describes a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the differential identification of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in clinical samples, and compares its performance with less discriminatory culture and quantitative immunofluorescence (if) assays. fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probes directed to specific 16s rrna sequences of p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, prevotella pallens and prevotella denticola were hybridized under stringent conditions with cultured reference strains or plaque samples from deep periodontal pockets. probe specificity was defined with strains from multiple oral prevotella species. the lower detection level of the assays was approximately 3x10(3) target cells per ml of plaque-sample suspension. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. pallens and p. denticola were detected in plaques with prevalences of 69, 67, 0 and 28%, respectively. on average, 3.9 x 10(6) p. intermedia, 3.1 x 10(6) p. nigrescens and 5.6 x 10(5) p. denticola cells were counted per positive sample. all three species were found almost exclusively in dense mixed aggregates. quantitative fish data agreed satisfactorily with corresponding if data (r=0.711). both fish and if enumerations of the sum of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens markedly exceeded the c.f.u. counts of black-pigmented colonies in porphyromonas gingivalis-free cultured subgingival plaques. the results demonstrate the validity of this new assay. unlike established if, culture, pcr or checkerboard dna hybridization assays, this fish assay differentiates quantitatively between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, provides visual accuracy control, and offers insights into the spatial distribution of the target cells within a clinical sample.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathic bacteria dna from periodontitis-involved gingival tissue using a pcr method].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of periodontopathic bacteria dna in the granulation tissue of periodontally involved gingival tissue. forty periodontitis patients were examined. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were collected from the patients before surgery. then, granulation tissue was also collected during surgery. another 20 patients, who had more than 4 mm in probing pocket depth, were also examined as a control. they received only initial treatment without periodontal surgery. plaque and saliva samples were also collected from them. seven periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, toreponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, were detected by a pcr method from these samples of all patients. as clinical parameters, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing were recorded. one year after surgery, sampling of subgingival plaque and saliva, and measurement of clinical parameters were performed on the patients. the dna of periodontopathic bacteria was detected in the granulation tissue of 29 out of 40 patients. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected in 23, 11, 12, 9, 3, 2 and 1 subject(s) respectively. the sites with undetectable level of any periodontal pathogens at one year after surgery showed a clinical attachment  gain of 2.44 mm, while those that showed detectable pathogen levels had only a 0.77 mm gain. our results indicated that the removal of granulation tissue contributed to eliminating periodontal pathogens and to avoiding re-infection by  those bacteria. complete eradication of periodontopathic bacteria would be necessary for successful periodontal treatment.

TI  == maternal periodontitis and prematurity. part ii: maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == humoral immune response in early-onset periodontitis: influence of smoking.
AB  == sixty-five patients with generalised early-onset periodontitis (g-eop) (age range 16-42 years, 32 smokers and 33 non-smokers) were assessed for antibody titres and avidity to a panel of five suspected periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus). thirty-four of these patients were untreated (17 smokers and 17 non-smokers), and thirty-one were in the maintenance phase of periodontal therapy (15 smokers and 16 non-smokers). previous studies have investigated the effect of smoking on igg levels in periodontitis patients in the context of the more extensive periodontal destruction seen in smokers. based on this literature our hypothesis was that smokers would have depressed serum igg levels directed against recognised periodontal pathogens compared with non-smokers. antibody titres were measured by elisa deploying fixed whole cells as coating. the igg response was detected with  biotin-anti-human igg and avidin-peroxidase; avidity was determined by elution with ammonium thiocyanate. median titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and t. denticola were significantly lower in maintenance patient smokers (p= 0.02, 0.02 and 0.002 respectively) but not in untreated patients. avidity to p. gingivalis was also lower in smoking maintenance patients (p = 0.003) but not in untreated patients. these findings may imply some interruption  of immune maturation in smokers following periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles in children with chronic neutropenia under supervised oral hygiene.
AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

TI  == detection of putative oral pathogens in acute periradicular abscesses by 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

AB  == background, aims: the purpose of this study was to detect the presence of prevotella intermedia, p. nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus in plaque samples from 119 children, collected from their toothbrushes using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). method: the subjects  were 24, 83, and 12 children with healthy gingiva, gingivitis, and periodontitis, respectively, ranging in age from 2-12 years old. plaque samples were collected from all erupted teeth sites using a sterile toothbrush. the mean concentration of dna recovered from the plaque samples was approximately 640 microg/ml, which was deemed sufficient for performing a pcr-based survey. results: the prevalence  by pcr in healthy, gingivitis, and periodontitis subjects was 0.0%, 6.0% and 25.0% for p. intermedia, 45.8%, 79.5% and 50.0% for p. nigrescens, 33.3%, 63.9% and 58.3% for b. forsythus, 0.0%, 18.1% and 16.7% for t. denticola, and 100% in duplicate for c. rectus, respectively. conclusion: our survey indicated that p. intermedia and t. denticola were more associated with periodontal diseases, b. forsythus and p. nigrescens had a moderate prevalence in all clinical groups, while c. rectus were the most commonly detected species in the oral cavities of children suggesting establishment in their early years.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole in sites with and without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == in a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. at least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were  prevotella buccae and prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of  10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). no beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). all  the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == risk indicators for harboring periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == crevicular fluid level of beta-glucuronidase in relation to clinical periodontal  parameters and putative periodontal pathogens in early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == analysis of beta-glucuronidase (betag) in the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) provides an indication of neutrophil influx into the crevicular environment. the  aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that: (1) betag is significantly elevated in individuals with early-onset periodontitis (eop) and that betag activity correlates with disease severity; and (2) betag level may reflect the local bacterial challenge in the gingival crevice. the study subjects consisted of a sub-sample of individuals examined in the national survey of oral health of  united states children, which was undertaken during the 1986/87 school year. a total of 249 individuals were selected based on presence or absence of clinical attachment loss at baseline. the individuals were examined a second time 6 years  later and the clinical attachment loss was assessed, and subgingival plaque and gcf were collected. the subjects were classified into 3 types of eop and a control group. betag activity in the gcf and the levels of 7 putative micro-organisms in the pocket were assessed. the generalized eop group had the highest betag activity, followed by the localized and incidental eop groups, and  the controls, respectively. there was a significant increase in betag activity with the increase in probing depth. also, sites with bleeding on probing had a significantly higher betag activity than sites without bleeding. however, the effect of gingival inflammation on betag activity was more evident in the generalized and localized eop groups. sites harboring high levels of one or more  of the micro-organisms tended to have high betag activity. there were moderate differences between the organisms with respect to their effect on betag activity, but sites with high numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, or treponema denticola also had the highest betag activity. the present findings  suggest that betag activity in gcf from patients with eop can be of value in the  early identification of individuals at higher risk of developing eop the findings also suggest that host mechanisms leading to higher betag activity in eop represent systemic responses and are only partly related to the presence of local factors at the site-level.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

TI  == dental plaque flora of the dog with reference to fastidious and anaerobic bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == animal bite wounds are amongst the most common types of traumatic injuries in humans. the organisms isolated from these wounds generally reflect the oral flora of the biting animal, and may be fastidious in nature and difficult to identify.  this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas and prevotella spp. in supragingival dental plaque collected from the right maxillary canine and carnassial teeth and the right mandibular canine tooth of dogs. in part one of the study, 30 dogs were used. e. corrodens was found in 62% of these dogs and 44% of individual plaque samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the dogs sampled. in part two, 34 dogs were used to determine the prevalence of the black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (porphyromonas and prevotella spp.). porphyromonas gingivalis was present in 68% of these dogs and 47% of individual plaque samples. prevotella intermedia was present in 44% of the dogs and 23% of individual plaque samples. the recently described porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas salivosa, porphyromonas cangingivalis, porphyromonas cansulci, porphyromonas crevioricanis and prevotella denticola species were isolated from only 9%, 6%, 3%, 3%, 3% and 3% of dogs respectively. porphyromonas gingivicanis was not isolated from any of the animals sampled. in conclusion, black-pigmented  anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 91% of the animals sampled and therefore constitute a significant risk with respect to bite wound infections. it is also suggested that the prevalence of e. corrodens in wound infections has been underestimated in previous reports because of use of inappropriate techniques for detecting this organism.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == inhibition of prevotella and capnocytophaga immunoglobulin a1 proteases by human  serum.
AB  == oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin  a1 (iga1) proteases cleaving human iga1 in the hinge region into intact fab and fc fragments. to investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven prevotella and capnocytophaga proteases. all or nearly all of the sera inhibited the iga1 protease activity of prevotella buccae, prevotella oris, and prevotella loescheii. a minor proportion of the sera inhibited prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica iga1 proteases, while no sera inhibited capnocytophaga ochracea iga1 protease. all inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. no correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. the nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the iga1 proteases of p. buccae, p. oris, and p. loescheii was further examined. in size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of iga. additional inhibition of the p.  oris iga1 protease was found in fractions containing both iga and igg. purification of the igg fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein g column resulted in recovery of inhibitory igg antibodies against all three iga1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the p. oris enzyme. these  finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing  antibodies.

TI  == prevalence of porphyromonas and prevotella species in the dental plaque of dogs.
AB  == the prevalence and populations of porphyromonas and prevotella species were determined in three samples of dental plaque from each of 34 healthy dogs. porphyromonas gingivalis was present in 68 per cent of the dogs and 47 per cent of the plaque samples. the counts of p gingivalis increased with age (p < 0.1), the amount of plaque (p < 0.05) and the degree of gingivitis (p < 0.1). prevotella intermedia was present in 44 per cent of the dogs and 23 per cent of the plaque samples. the counts of p intermedia were correlated with the amount of plaque (p < 0.05) and the degree of gingivitis (p < 0.1). porphyromonas canoris,  p salivosa, p cangingivalis, p cansulci, p crevioricanis and prevotella denticola were isolated from only 9, 6, 3, 3, 3 and 3 per cent of the dogs, respectively. porphyromonas gingivicanis was not isolated from any of the animals sampled. there was a highly significant (p < 0.001) correlation between the amount of plaque, the extent of gingivitis and the age of the dog.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.

TI  == antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == proteolytic artifacts in sds-page analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (sds+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. a control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of p. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in p. nigrescens and t. denticola. no proteolysis was observed for f. nucleatum. in all cases, heat (100  degrees c) and low ph (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production  of proteolytic artifacts. incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. more particularly, n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mm) were highly efficient for p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens and t. denticola, respectively. when outer membranes of p. gingivalis  were prepared in the presence of tlck, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of tlck, were detected. the present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

TI  == an investigation into the use of sds-page of cell surface extracts and proteolytic activity to differentiate prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == by comparison of the cell surface proteins derived from the outer membrane and fibrils from 14 prevotella intermedia and 19 prevotella nigrescens strains using  sds and analysed by sds-page, it was possible to distinguish the two species. a polypeptide of approx. 21 kda distinguished p. intermedia strains, whereas two polypeptides of approx. 18 and 22 kda could be used to identify p. nigrescens strains. four other human oral black pigmented bacterial species (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii and prevotella melaninogenica) did not have the 18-, 21- or 22-kda polypeptides shown by p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. the cell-associated proteolytic activity of eight strains of p. intermedia, 14 strains of p. nigrescens and one strain of p. gingivalis (w50) was assessed using four chromogenic substrates. the hydrolysis of the substrate gppna (indicative of dipeptidyl peptidase iv-like activity) and  saappna (elastase-like activity) by p. intermedia strains varied from 32 to 114 units and 0.5 to 12.6 units of activity respectively, where one unit was defined  as the amount of protease enzyme catalysing the formation of 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline under experimental conditions. 37.5% (3 of 8) of p. intermedia strains hydrolysed saappna (chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity) with activities of between 7 and 12 units. the hydrolysis of gppna and saaapna by p. nigrescens strains was 32-149 and 3-16 units, respectively. 57% (8 of 14) of p. nigrescens strains hydrolysed saapppna with activities ranging from 3 to 8 units. none of the p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains examined were found to have trypsin-like enzyme activity (bapna hydrolysis). the gppna and saaapna hydrolytic activity associated with the proteases from porphyromonas gingivalis w50 was at least twice that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens strains. the similar peptidase activities of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens against chromogenic substrates cannot be used to differentiate the species, but sds-page of cell surface protein extracts allowed unambiguous speciation between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. this simple technique of cell surface protein analysis can be performed in most laboratories and offers a convenient way by which to differentiate the two species.

TI  == characterization of inhibitory effects of suspected periodontopathogens on osteogenesis in vitro.
AB  == by using an in vitro bone-forming culture system, the chick periosteal osteogenesis (cpo) model, the direct effects on osteogenesis of sonicated extracts derived from oral bacteria were examined. both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia, hereinafter referred to as suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (streptococcus sanguis, veillonella atypica, and prevotella denticola, hereinafter referred to as nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. all bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. these were added in various proportions to the cpo cultures. parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and p(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6-day-old cultures. compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. no osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. these results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. further characterization of the p. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. p. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in cpo cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects. the bacterial extracts had either reversible or irreversible inhibitory effects on osteogenesis when added after differentiation or before/during differentiation of bone cells, respectively.

TI  == cellular source, activation and inhibition of dental plaque collagenase.
AB  == dental plaque is the major aetiological factor in periodontal diseases and contains several proteolytic enzymes. the origin of these proteinases is, however, poorly studied. this study was undertaken to characterize collagenase present in dental plaque of adult periodontitis patients. vertebrate-type rather  than bacterial-derived collagenase activity was detected in extracts of both supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts of adult periodontitis patients. dental plaque collagenase was found to exist predominantly in autoactive form. dental plaque collagenase from periodontally healthy individuals existed in latent from. latent dental plaque collagenase from periodontitis lesions could be activated by a 95 kd chymotrypsin-like proteinase from treponema denticola and human leukocyte cathepsin g but not by human plasmin. incubation of purified latent leukocyte collagenase with whole cells of fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium saburreum, prevotella buccae and porphyromonas gingivalis, however, did not result to the activation of the enzyme. doxycycline in vitro inhibited dental plaque collagenase with an ic50-value of 20 microm. dental plaque collagenase degraded more efficiently type i and ii collagens than type iii collagen. western-blot analysis with specific anti-human neutrophil collagenase-antibody revealed that both in supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts dental plaque collagenase had undergone proteolytic conversion from an 80 kd proform to a 58 kd active form which is associated with catalytic autoactivity as measured by functional collagenase assay. this reflects proteolytic activation of leukocyte collagenase in dental plaque probably by other proteases derived from potent periodontopathogenic bacteria such as t. denticola or other pmn proteases such as cathepsin g.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) activities that resemble those in host tissue. here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. dpp ii and dpp iv fractions with acid and alkaline ph optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. bacterial  cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. there was  moderate to strong dpp activity with capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp., very weak activity with treponema denticola and no detectable activity with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fusobacterium nucleatum. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. in  gels washed with acid buffer, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue dpp ii. use of an alkaline washing buffer showed gcf activity which closely matched tissue dpp iv that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in  the gingival crevice. p. gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had  counterparts in gcf. the apparent presence in gcf of the dpp from p. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.

TI  == characterisation of black-pigmented anaerobes isolated from diseased and healthy  periodontal sites.
AB  == prevotella intermedia has recently been re-defined and a new species, prevotella  nigrescens has been proposed. however, there is little data available on the incidence of these new species in periodontal health or disease. black-pigmented  anaerobes isolated from diseased and healthy subgingival sites were identified by serotyping, sds-page and physiological tests. in adult periodontitis subjects, 64% of active sites, 35.7% of inactive sites and 38.5% of healthy sites yielded black-pigmented anaerobes. of these, porphyromonas gingivalis was found in 11% of active and 5% of healthy sites in diseased patients, prevotella intermedia in 15.5% of active and 20.5% of healthy sites, prevotella nigrescens in 37.7% of active and 11.5% of healthy sites and prevotella denticola in 3% of active and 1% of healthy sites. in healthy subjects, 50% of sites yielded black-pigmented anaerobes. p. gingivalis was not found in healthy subjects but p. intermedia was  found in 18% and p. nigrescens in 31% of sites. sds-page proved to be a useful method for routinely differentiating p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and two sub-types of the latter species were detected on the basis of band pattern. only  one p. nigrescens sub-type was found in any given individual and one type, typified by atcc 25261, was more commonly found in deep pockets. however, overall both p. nigrescens and p. intermedia as species were just as frequently found at  healthy sites as diseased sites. thus, these species, in contrast to p. gingivalis, appear to be common commensals but they may act as opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == the oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora in young children: longitudinal changes from edentulous to dentate mouth.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the composition of oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora was investigated in 21 young children (mean age 32 months) with primary dentition. the bacterial findings of samples were compared with those of the same children collected at their edentulous infant period (mean age 3 months). during the primary period, 2 samples were collected from each child: a sample with dental floss from gingival margin of 2 teeth and stimulated saliva pooled with a mucosal swab sample. both samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. prevotella  melaninogenica, nonpigmented prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum group and capnocytophaga spp. were found in all children at the older age, whereas they occurred in edentulous mouth in 76%, 62%, 67% and 19%, respectively. the occurrence of prevotella loescheii increased from 14% to 90%, prevotella intermedia from 10% to 67%, leptotrichia spp. from 24 to 71%, campylobacter (wolinella) spp. from 5 to 43% and eikenella corrodens from 5 to 57%. only the occurrence of bacteroides gracilis and veillonella spp. remained at about the same level. species not isolated from the edentulous mouth, such as prevotella denticola, fusobacterium spp. other than the f. nucleatum group and selenomonas spp. were now detected in 71%, 71% and 43% of the children. the stability of the  colonizing p. melaninogenica strain(s) in the oral cavity was determined by using ribotyping; 1-2 isolates per child from the edentulous infant period of 9 children and 3-15 isolates per child from their primary dentition period were analyzed.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

TI  == configural frequency analysis for exploring bacterial sets in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == periodontal research has been concerned with identifying bacterial sets in oral health and disease. configural frequency analysis (cfa) is a taxonomical method used to test the statistical significance of patterns of elementary cell frequencies in cross-tabulated data, and may therefore be used to evaluate interactions among occurrences and non-occurrences of periodontal microorganisms. cfa patterns may exist as configural types or anti-types depending on whether observed cell frequencies are greater or less than expected frequencies, respectively, based on table marginals. cfa was applied to two published data sets. in the first, the occurrence of bacteroides (porphyromonas) gingivalis (bg) and treponema denticola (td) was studied in military subjects. analysis of individual cells of the resultant two-by-two contingency table revealed the existence of a single anti-type (td in the absence of bg) suggesting a sequential phenomenon. the second, more complex, data set was based on reported occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), bg, and bacteroides (prevotella) intermedius (bi) in sites with and without progressive periodontitis. cfa based on all data identified three statistically significant configural types and two anti-types. however, a somewhat different configurational picture emerged when disease progression status was considered a stratification variable for separate  analysis. all these analyses, which were undertaken for expository purposes, assumed independence of observations. methodological procedures are suggested for cfa when observations are not independent.

AB  == necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. the number of different species in one canal is usually low,  approx. 4-7 species. the species isolated most frequently belong to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and streptococcus. the frequency of isolation of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by pr. denticola and two porphyromonas species, p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis. several studies have shown that p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis are closely related to the presence  of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are not. however, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. moreover, porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. although porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.

TI  == pigmented prevotella species in the periodontally healthy oral cavity.
AB  == pigmented prevotella spp. have been connected with oral infections as well as being part of the healthy gingival flora. the aim of this study was to determine  the presence of pigmented prevotella spp. in saliva and gingival crevice samples  from periodontally healthy adults. twelve caucasian female subjects (mean age 28  years, range 21-36 years) with no pockets > or = 4 mm, nor bleeding after probing were selected for this study. paraffin-stimulated saliva was collected first; then, a pooled subgingival bacterial sample was taken with a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of all first molars. the samples were inoculated on to non-selective and selective media and incubated anaerobically. the most frequent  species isolated were pr. melaninogenica, pr. intermedia and pr. loescheu, found  in 11, ten and nine subjects, respectively. the mean percentage of the total cultivable anaerobic microflora in salivary/subgingival samples were 14.7/0.6 for pr. melaninogenica, 3.1/5.3 for pr. intermedia and 2.6/1.2 for pr. loescheii. pr. denticola was found in one saliva sample and pr. corporis, in two subgingival samples only. the number of different pigmented prevotella spp. in the same mouth was 2-4 (mean 2.75). in conclusion, pr. melaninogenica, pr. intermedia and pr. loescheii seem to be common microorganisms in the periodontally healthy oral cavity.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in periodontitis.
AB  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes have been associated with periodontal disease and tooth loss since they were first isolated by burdon in 1928. porphyromonas gingivalis, which is usually not isolated from children, adolescents or adults with no periodontal breakdown, has been recognized as one of the most important periodontopathogens. its presence is strongly correlated with deep periodontal pockets, which are assumed to be its main habitat. correlations have been shown also with attachment loss, clinical inflammation and serum antibody levels, indicating an aetiological role in the periodontal disease. their pathogenicity in animal models resembling periodontal disease is documented. they are frequently isolated from periodontal abscesses. the relationship between prevotella intermedia and periodontal disease is not clear.  it is frequently isolated from advanced periodontitis, often as the only black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic species; however, the prevalence in adults with no periodontal breakdown is high. it is found frequently in periodontal abscesses and in acute necrotizing and ulcerative gingivitis. serogroup i is found predominantly in deep periodontal pockets, whereas all serogroups (i-iii) are found in shallow pockets and gingivitis. no conclusive difference in pathogenicity between serogroups has been found. pr. melaninogenica, pr. denticola and pr. loescheii are frequently found in the gingival crevice in preschool children and other age groups with gingivitis, but  are seldom found in deep periodontal pockets.

TI  == transfer of conjugal elements in oral black-pigmented bacteroides (prevotella) spp. involves dna rearrangements.
AB  == conjugal genetic elements in isolates of oral black-pigmented bacteroides denticola (prevotella denticola) and b. intermedius (p. intermedia) transfer tetracycline and penicillin resistance in the absence of plasmids. transverse alternating-field electrophoresis of restricted chromosomal dnas from transconjugants revealed arrangements indicating that transfer and insertion can  involve more than one 60-kb copy of the elements and occurs at strongly preferred sites in the recipient chromosome.

TI  == the use of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of bacteroides intermedius isolates in a dot blot assay.
AB  == bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. these two groups are represented by the type strain of the species atcc 25611t (b. intermedius type i) and by atcc 33563 (b. intermedius type ii). members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by  sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and by dna-dna homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. the purpose of this study was to prepare specific dna probes for the two groups of bacteroides intermedius and  to test them against field isolates. whole-cell dna probes were prepared from b.  intermedius types i and ii and tested against 253 field strains of bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as b. intermedius. of  these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the b. intermedius type i dna probe, 28 (11%) with the type ii, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the b. intermedius probes but  did hybridize with either b. melaninogenicus, b. loescheii, or b. corporis whole-cell dna probes. the 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five bacteroides probes or with probes to b. asaccharolyticus, b. buccae, b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. gingivalis, b. oralis, or b. oris. these data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.
