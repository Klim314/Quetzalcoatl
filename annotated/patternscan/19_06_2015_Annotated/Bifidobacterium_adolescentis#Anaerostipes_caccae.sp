TI  == arabinoxylans and inulin differentially modulate the mucosal and luminal gut microbiota and mucin-degradation in humanized rats.
AB  == the endogenous gut microbiota affects the host in many ways. prebiotics should favour beneficial intestinal microbes and thus improve host health. in this study, we investigated how a novel class of potential prebiotic long-chain arabinoxylans (lc-ax) and the well-established prebiotic inulin (in) modulate the gut microbiota of humanized rats. six weeks after axenic rats were inoculated with a human faecal microbiota, their colonic microbiota was similar to this inoculum ( approximately 70%), whereas their caecal microbiota was enriched with  verrucomicrobia and firmicutes concomitant with lower abundance of bacteroidetes. moreover, different bifidobacterium species colonized the lumen (b. adolescentis) and mucus (b. longum and b. bifidum). both lc-ax and in increased scfa levels and induced a shift from acetate towards health-promoting propionate and butyrate respectively. by applying a high-resolution phylogenetic micro-array (hitchip) at the site of fermentation (caecum), in and lc-ax were shown to stimulate bacterial groups with known butyrate-producers (roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, anaerostipes caccae) and bifidobacteria (b. longum) respectively. prebiotic administration also resulted in lower caecal abundances of the mucin-degrading akkermansia muciniphila and potentially more mucin production by  the host. both factors might explain the increased caecal mucin levels for lc-ax  (threefold) and in (sixfold). these mucins were degraded along the colon, resulting in high faecal abundances of akkermansia muciniphila for lc-ax and especially in-treated rats. finally, the microbial changes caused an adaptation period for the host with less weight gain, after which the host fine-tuned the interaction with this altered microbiota. our results demonstrate that next to in, lc-ax are promising prebiotic compounds by stimulating production of health-promoting metabolites by specific microbes in the proximal regions. further, prebiotic supplementation shifted mucin degradation to distal regions, where mucin-degraders may produce beneficial metabolites (e.g. propionate by akkermansia muciniphila), so that prebiotics may potentially improve gut health along the entire length of the intestine.

TI  == lactate has the potential to promote hydrogen sulphide formation in the human colon.
AB  == high concentrations of sulphide are toxic for the gut epithelium and may contribute to bowel disease. lactate is a favoured cosubstrate for the sulphate-reducing colonic bacterium desulfovibrio piger, as shown here by the stimulation of sulphide formation by d. piger dsm749 by lactate in the presence of sulphate. sulphide formation by d. piger was also stimulated in cocultures with the lactate-producing bacterium bifidobacterium adolescentis l2-32. other lactate-utilizing bacteria such as the butyrate-producing species eubacterium hallii and anaerostipes caccae are, however, expected to be in competition with the sulphate-reducing bacteria (srb) for the lactate formed in the human colon. strains of e. hallii and a. caccae produced 65% and 96% less butyrate from lactate, respectively, in a coculture with d. piger dsm749 than in a pure culture. in triculture experiments involving b. adolescentis l2-32, up to 50% inhibition of butyrate formation by e. hallii and a. caccae was observed in the presence of d. piger dsm749. on the other hand, sulphide formation by d. piger was unaffected by e. hallii or a. caccae in these cocultures and tricultures. these experiments strongly suggest that lactate can stimulate sulphide formation  by srb present in the colon, with possible consequences for conditions such as colitis.

TI  == two routes of metabolic cross-feeding between bifidobacterium adolescentis and butyrate-producing anaerobes from the human gut.
AB  == dietary carbohydrates have the potential to influence diverse functional groups of bacteria within the human large intestine. of 12 bifidobacterium strains of human gut origin from seven species tested, four grew in pure culture on starch and nine on fructo-oligosaccharides. the potential for metabolic cross-feeding between bifidobacterium adolescentis and lactate-utilizing, butyrate-producing firmicute bacteria related to eubacterium hallii and anaerostipes caccae was investigated in vitro. e. hallii l2-7 and a. caccae l1-92 failed to grow on starch in pure culture, but in coculture with b. adolescentis l2-32 butyrate was  formed, indicating cross-feeding of metabolites to the lactate utilizers. studies with [(13)c]lactate confirmed carbon flow from lactate, via acetyl coenzyme a, to butyrate both in pure cultures of e. hallii and in cocultures with b. adolescentis. similar results were obtained in cocultures involving b. adolescentis dsm 20083 with fructo-oligosaccharides as the substrate. butyrate formation was also stimulated, however, in cocultures of b. adolescentis l2-32 grown on starch or fructo-oligosaccharides with roseburia sp. strain a2-183, which produces butyrate but does not utilize lactate. this is probably a consequence of the release by b. adolescentis of oligosaccharides that are available to roseburia sp. strain a2-183. we conclude that two distinct mechanisms of metabolic cross-feeding between b. adolescentis and butyrate-forming bacteria may operate in gut ecosystems, one due to consumption of fermentation end products (lactate and acetate) and the other due to cross-feeding of partial breakdown products from complex substrates.

TI  == lactate-utilizing bacteria, isolated from human feces, that produce butyrate as a major fermentation product.
AB  == the microbial community of the human colon contains many bacteria that produce lactic acid, but lactate is normally detected only at low concentrations (<5 mm)  in feces from healthy individuals. it is not clear, however, which bacteria are mainly responsible for lactate utilization in the human colon. here, bacteria able to utilize lactate and produce butyrate were identified among isolates obtained from 10(-8) dilutions of fecal samples from five different subjects. out of nine such strains identified, four were found to be related to eubacterium hallii and two to anaerostipes caccae, while the remaining three represent a new  species within clostridial cluster xiva based on their 16s rrna sequences. significant ability to utilize lactate was not detected in the butyrate-producing species roseburia intestinalis, eubacterium rectale, or faecalibacterium prausnitzii. whereas e. hallii and a. caccae strains used both d- and l-lactate,  the remaining strains used only the d form. addition of glucose to batch cultures prevented lactate utilization until the glucose became exhausted. however, when two e. hallii strains and one a. caccae strain were grown in separate cocultures  with a starch-utilizing bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate, with starch as the  carbohydrate energy source, the l-lactate produced by b. adolescentis became undetectable and butyrate was formed. such cross-feeding may help to explain the  reported butyrogenic effect of certain dietary substrates, including resistant starch. the abundance of e. hallii in particular in the colonic ecosystem suggests that these bacteria play important roles in preventing lactate accumulation.
