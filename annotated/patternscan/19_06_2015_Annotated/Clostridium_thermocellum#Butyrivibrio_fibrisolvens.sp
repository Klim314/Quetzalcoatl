TI  == cloning of a gene encoding cinnamoyl ester hydrolase from the ruminal bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens e14 by a novel method.
AB  == a gene (cini) encoding a cinnamoyl ester hydrolase (ceh) has been isolated from the ruminal bacterium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens e14, using a model substrate, mutmac [4-methylumbelliferoyl (p-trimethylammonium cinnamate chloride)]. cini has significant amino-acid similarities with members of a large and diverse family of hydrolases with a serine/aspartic acid/histidine catalytic triad. our analyses identified two previously unclassified amino acid sequences, the amino-terminal domain of unknown function in xynz from clostridium thermocellum and xync, an acetylxylan esterase from caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, as members of the same family of hydrolases. a previously described esterase with ceh activity, xyld from pseudomonas fluorescens ssp. cellulosa, is not similar to cini. cini was expressed at high levels in the periplasmic fraction of e. coli topp2 and released ferulic acid from fara [5-o-(trans-feruloyl)-arabinofuranose] prepared from wheat bran.

TI  == gene sequence and analysis of protein domains of egb, a novel family e endoglucanase from fibrobacter succinogenes s85.
AB  == the endoglucanase gene (endb) of fibrobacter succinogenes s85 encodes a protein of 555 amino acids (egb) with a m(r) of 62,500. egb shows homology with cellulases belonging to family e. residues involved in the catalytic activity of  celd from clostridium thermocellum are also found in egb. structure predictions suggest that egb, like celd, comprises a large alpha-helical catalytic domain plus a beta-strand domain of unknown function located in the n-terminal part of the protein. construction of a phylogenetic tree of family e catalytic domains revealed that egb is closest to a cellodextrinase from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.

TI  == features of the cellodextrinase gene from fibrobacter succinogenes s85.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.3-kb dna fragment containing a cellodextrinase gene (ceda) from the ruminal anaerobe fibrobacter succinogenes s85 was determined. activity was expressed from this fragment when it was cloned in both  orientations in pbluescript ks+ and sk-, indicating a functional f. succinogenes  promoter in escherichia coli. promoter sequences (ttgaaca and aataa) were identified upstream of the atg initiation codon preceded by a putative ribosome binding site. the ceda open reading frame of 1071 base pairs encoded a protein of 357 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 41.9 kda, similar to  the 40-kda size of the native protein as determined by gel filtration chromatography. ceda is proposed to belong to family 5 (family a) of the glycosyl hydrolases. the primary structure of the cellodextrinase showed over 40% similarity with endoglucanase 3 from f. succinogenes s85. short regions of similarity were also demonstrated with endoglucanase c from clostridium thermocellum, cela from ruminococcus flavefaciens, and two exoglucanases from yeast.

TI  == analyses of the gene and amino acid sequence of the prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola 23 xylanase reveals unexpected homology with endoglucanases from other genera of bacteria.
AB  == the dna sequence for the xylanase gene from prevotella (bacteroides) ruminicola 23 was determined. the xylanase gene encoded for a protein with a molecular weight of 65,740. an apparent leader sequence of 22 amino acids was observed. the promoter region for expression of the xylanase gene in bacteroides species was identified with a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. a region of high amino acid homology was found with the proposed catalytic domain of endoglucanases from several organisms, including butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, ruminococcus flavefaciens, and clostridium thermocellum. the cloned xylanase was  found to exhibit endoglucanase activity against carboxymethyl cellulose. analysis of the codon usage for the xylanase gene found a bias towards g and c in the third position in 16 of 18 amino acids with degenerate codons.

TI  == the gene encoding the cellulase (avicelase) cel1 from streptomyces reticuli and analysis of protein domains.
AB  == streptomyces reticuli produces an unusual cellulase (avicelase), with an apparent molecular weight of 82 kda, which is solely sufficient to degrade crystalline cellulose. during cultivation the processing of the avicelase to a truncated enzyme (42 kda) and an inactive protein (40 kda) correlated with the occurrence of an extracellular protease. after its purification this 36 kda protease cleaved the s. reticuli avicelase in vitro in the same manner. using antibodies raised against the avicelase and its truncated form (42 kda) and gene libraries of s. reticuli dna in the escherichia coli phage vectors lambda gt11 and charon 35, the avicelase gene (cel1) was identified. further subcloning and dna-sequencing revealed a g+c rich (72%) reading frame of 2238 bp encoding a protein of 746 amino acids. the transcriptional start site was mapped about 180 bp upstream from the gtg start codon. a signal sequence of 29 amino acids was identified by aligning the deduced amino acids with the characterized n-terminus of the 82 kda  avicelase. comparison of the n-terminal amino acids from the purified proteins with the amino acid sequence derived from the avicelase gene revealed that the truncated enzyme (42 kda) corresponds to the c-terminal region whereas the inactive proteolytically derived protein (40 kda) represents the n-terminal part  of the 82 kda avicelase. comparisons with amino acid sequences deduced from known cellulase genes indicated the presence of three putative protein domains: (i) an  n-terminal part showing significant similarity with a repeat region of endoglucanase c from cellulomonas fimi, recently shown to be a cellulose-binding  domain; (ii) an adjoining region sharing homology with the n-terminal domains with unknown function of endoglucanase a from pseudomonas fluorescens, endoglucanase d from clostridium thermocellum and a cellodextrinase from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and (iii) a c-terminal catalytic domain belonging to cellulase family e.

TI  == sequencing and expression of a cellodextrinase (ced1) gene from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c cloned in escherichia coli.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.314 kb dna segment containing a gene (ced1) expressing cellodextrinase activity from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c was determined. the b. fibrisolvens h17c gene was expressed from a weak internal promoter in escherichia coli and a putative consensus promoter sequence was identified upstream of a ribosome binding site and a gtg start codon. the complete amino acid sequence (547 residues) was deduced and homology was demonstrated with the clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase d (egd), pseudomonas fluorescens var. cellulosa endoglucanase (eg), and a cellulase from the avocado fruit (persea americana). the ced1 gene product ced1 showed cellodextrinase activity and rapidly hydrolysed short-chain cellodextrins to yield either cellobiose or cellobiose and glucose as end products. the ced1 enzyme released cellobiose from p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside and the enzyme was not inhibited by methylcellulose, an inhibitor of endoglucanase activity. although the major activity of the ced1 enzyme was that of a cellodextrinase it also showed limited activity against endoglucanase specific substrates [carboxymethylcellulose (cmc), lichenan, laminarin and xylan]. analysis by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with incorporated cmc showed a major activity band with an apparent mr of approximately 61,000. the calculated mr of the ced1 gene product was 61,023.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the ruminococcus albus sy3 endoglucanase genes cela and celb.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of ruminococcus albus genes cela and celb coding for endoglucanase a (ega) and endoglucanase b (egb), respectively, have been determined. the cela structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1095 bp. confirmation of the nucleotide sequence was obtained by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by n-terminal analysis of purified ega. the celb structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1227  bp; 7 bp upstream of the translational start codon of celb is a typical gram-positive shine-dalgarno sequence. the deduced n-terminal region of egb conforms to the general pattern for the signal peptides of secreted prokaryotic proteins. the complete celb gene, cloned into puc vectors, caused lethality in escherichia coli. in contrast, cela cloned in puc18, under the control of laczp,  directed high-level synthesis of ega in e. coli jm83. ega in cell-free extract, purified to near homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography, had a mr of 44.5 kda. gene deletion and subcloning studies with cela revealed that ega hydrolysed  both cmc and xylan, and did not contain discrete functional domains. ega and egb  showed considerable homology with each other, in addition to exhibiting similarity with eg1 (r. albus), ege (clostridium thermocellum) and end (butyrivibrio fibrisolvens).

TI  == cloning, sequencing and analysis of expression of a butyrivibrio fibrisolvens gene encoding a beta-glucosidase.
AB  == the cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of a 3.74 kb dna segment on pls215 containing a beta-glucosidase gene (bgla) from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c was investigated. the b. fibrisolvens bgla open reading frame (orf) of 2490  bp encoded a beta-glucosidase of 830 amino acid residues with a calculated mr of  91,800. in escherichia coli c600(pls215) cells the beta-glucosidase was localized in the cytoplasm and these cells produced an additional protein with an apparent  mr of approximately 94,000. the bgla gene was expressed from its own regulatory region in e. coli and a single mrna initiation point was identified upstream of the bgla orf and adjacent to a promoter consensus sequence. the primary structure of the beta-glucosidase showed greater than 40% similarity with a domain of 237 amino acids present in the beta-glucosidases of kluyveromyces fragilis and clostridium thermocellum. the b. fibrisolvens beta-glucosidase hydrolysed cellobiose to a limited extent, cellotriose to cellobiose and glucose, and cellotetraose and cellopentaose to predominantly glucose.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of an endoglucanase (end1) gene from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.8 kb dna segment containing an endoglucanase gene  (end1) from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c was determined. the b. fibrisolvens h17c gene was expressed from its own regulatory region in escherichia coli and three putative consensus promoter sequences were identified upstream of a ribosome binding site and an atg start codon. the complete amino acid sequence (547 residues) was deduced and homology with the clostridium thermocellum cele gene product (ege) was demonstrated. the endoglucanase contained a typical amino-terminal signal sequence and five repeated sequences (pdptpvd) between amino acids 412-447. the endoglucanase showed relatively high endoglucanase activity against endoglucanase-specific substrates with beta 1-4 linkages but low activity against xylan and an exoglucanase-specific substrate, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-cellobioside.
