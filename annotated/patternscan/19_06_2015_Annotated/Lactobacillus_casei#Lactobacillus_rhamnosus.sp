TI  == the dnaj gene as a molecular discriminator to differentiate among species and strain within the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == identifying lactobacillus casei and its closely related taxa at the species and strain level using only phenotypic and genotypic (16s rdna sequence homology analysis) techniques often yields inaccurate results. in this study, the dnaj chaperone gene was investigated as a molecular target for inter- and intraspecies discrimination within the lb. casei group as well as for the development of specific primers for species identification. the results showed that most of the  examined strains could be clearly distinguished from closely related species based on the sequenced fragments. at the interspecies level, the dnaj sequence similarities were 81.7%-85.5%. however, at the intraspecies level, the dnaj sequence similarities were 96.2-100% and could be assigned to different haplotypes in lb. paracasei and lb. rhamnosus, respectively. compared to the 16s  rrna gene, the dnaj sequence showed greater variation at both the species and strain level. thus, the dnaj gene can be proposed as an alternative marker for the lb. casei group that provides higher discriminatory power than the 16s rrna gene. in addition, species-specific primers were developed and subsequently employed in two-plex minisequencing analysis and shown to be specific for lb. paracasei and lb. rhamnosus. our data indicate that phylogenetic relationships in the lb. casei group can be resolved using comparative sequence analysis of the dnaj gene and that the lb. paracasei and lb. rhamnosus species can be simultaneously identified using a novel species-specific minisequencing assay.

TI  == evaluation of synergistic interactions between cell-free supernatant of lactobacillus strains and amikacin and genetamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background: the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the treatment of infectious  diseases can increase the development of antibiotic resistance. therefore, there  is a big demand for new sources of antimicrobial agents and alternative treatments for reduction of antibiotic dosage required to decrease the associated side effects. objectives: in this study, the synergistic action of aminoglycoside antibiotics and cell-free supernatant (cfs) of probiotic (lactobacillus rahmnosus and l. casei) against pseudomonas aeruginosa ptcc 1430 was evaluated. materials and methods: a growth medium for culturing of probiotic bacteria was separated by centrifugation. the antimicrobial effects of cfs of probiotic bacteria were evaluated using the agar well diffusion assay. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were evaluated using the micro dilution method. finally, an interaction between cfs and amikacin or gentamicin against p. aeruginosa ptcc 1430 was examined through the checkerboard method and fractional inhibitory concentration (fic). furthermore, cfss from lactobacillus strains were analyzed by reversed phase hplc (rp-hplc) for antimicrobial compounds. results: the results showed a significant effect of  cfs on the growth of p. aeruginosa. the mic and mbc of cfs from l. casei were 62.5 microlml while the mic and mbc of cfs from l. rhamnosus were 62.5 mulml and  125 mulml, respectively. using the fic indices, synergistic interactions were observed in combination of cfs and antibiotics. fractional inhibitory concentration indices of cfs from l. casei and aminoglycoside antibiotics were 0.124 and 0.312 while fic indices of cfs from l. rhamnosus and aminoglycoside antibiotics were 0.124 and 0.56, respectively showing a synergism effect. the results of rp-hplc showed that cfs of lactobacillus strains contained acetic acid, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). conclusions: our findings indicate that probiotic bacterial strains of lactobacillus have a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of p. aeruginosa ptcc 1430. the antimicrobial potency of this combination can be useful for designing and developing alternative therapeutic strategies against p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == biochemical analysis of respiratory metabolism in the heterofermentative lactobacillus spicheri and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == aims: this study evaluated the aerobic and respiratory metabolism in lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus spicheri, two heterofermentative species  used in sourdough fermentation. methods and results: in silico genome analysis, production of metabolites and gene expression of pyruvate oxidase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase were assessed in anaerobic and aerobic cultures of l. reuteri and l. spicheri. respiring homofermentative l. casei n87 and l. rhamnosus n132 were used for comparison. aerobiosis and respiration increased the biomass production of heterofermentative strains compared to anaerobic cultivation. respiration led to acetoin production by l. rhamnosus and  l. casei, but not in heterofermentative strains, in which lactate and acetate were the major end-products. l. spicheri lp38 showed the highest oxygen uptake. pyruvate oxidase, respiratory cytochromes, nadh-oxidase and nadh-peroxidase were  present in the genome of l. spicheri lp38. both l. spicheri lp38 and l. rhamnosus n132 overexpressed pox in aerobic cultures, while cyda was up-regulated only when heme was supplied; pdh was repressed during aerobic growth. conclusions: aerobic  and respiratory growth provided physiological and metabolic advantages also in heterofermentative lactobacilli. significance and impact of the study: the exploitation of oxygen-tolerant phenotypes of l. spicheri may be useful for the development of improved starter cultures. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == preparative scale purification of fucosyl-n-acetylglucosamine disaccharides and their evaluation as potential prebiotics and antiadhesins.
AB  == fucosyl-n-acetylglucosamine disaccharides are important core structures that form part of human mucosal and milk glyco-complexes. we have previously shown that alfb and alfc alpha-l-fucosidases from lactobacillus casei are able to synthesize fucosyl-alpha-1,3--n-acetylglucosamine (fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac) and fucosyl-alpha-1,6-n-acetylglucosamine (fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac), respectively, in transglycosylation reactions. here, these reactions were performed in a semipreparative scale, and the produced disaccharides were purified. the maximum  yields obtained of fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac and fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac were 4.2 and 9.3 g/l, respectively. the purified fucosyl-disaccharides were then analyzed for their prebiotic effect in vitro using strains from the lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus group and from bifidobacterium species. the results revealed that 6 out of 11 l. casei strains and 2 out of 6 l. rhamnosus strains tested were able to ferment fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac, and l. casei bl87 and l. rhamnosus bl327 strains were also able to ferment fuc-alpha1,6-glcnac. dna hybridization experiments suggested that the metabolism of fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac in those strains relies in an alpha-l-fucosidase homologous to alfb. bifidobacterium breve and bibidobacterium pseudocatenolatum species also metabolized fuc-alpha1,3-glcnac. notably, l-fucose was excreted from all the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains fermenting fucosyl-disaccharides, except from strains l. rhamnosus bl358 and bl377, indicating that in these latest strains, l-fucose was catabolized. the fucosyl-disaccharides were also tested for their inhibitory  potential of pathogen adhesion to human colon adenocarcinoma epithelial (ht29) cell line. enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) strains isolated from infantile gastroenteritis were used, and the results showed that both fucosyl-disaccharides inhibited adhesion to different extents of certain epec strains to ht29 cells in tissue culture.

TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus partially alleviates tma-induced atopic dermatitis in mice through improving intestinal microbiota.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus (lcr35) on atopic dermatitis (ad)-like symptoms in mice.  methods and results: ad-like skin lesions in balb/c mice were induced by sensitization and subsequent repeated challenges with trimellitic anhydride (tma) for 10 days. lcr35 was orally administered to the mice once daily throughout the  study. in the tma-induced ad model, orally administered lcr35 suppressed significantly irritant-related scratching behaviour and skin dehydration as well  as apparent severity of ad. lcr35 also significantly decreased serum levels of ige and il-4, but not ifn-gamma, implying the restoration of tma-induced disruption of th1/th2 balance. quantitative real-time pcr targeting hypervariable regions of 16s rdna gene of faecal microbiota indicated that the lcr35 treatment  increased the population of bifidobacterium, lactobacilli, enterococcus and bacteroides fragilis group, but decreased those of clostridium coccoides group. conclusions: lcr35 has the ability to suppress the development of ad in mice, possibly through the modulation of th1/th2 balance and gut microbiota. significance and impact of the study: lcr35 has a strong potential as a probiotic for preventing ad.

TI  == colonization of germ-free mice with a mixture of three lactobacillus strains enhances the integrity of gut mucosa and ameliorates allergic sensitization.
AB  == increasing numbers of clinical trials and animal experiments have shown that probiotic bacteria are promising tools for allergy prevention. here, we analyzed  the immunomodulatory properties of three selected lactobacillus strains and the impact of their mixture on allergic sensitization to bet v 1 using a gnotobiotic  mouse model. we showed that lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus lock0900, l. rhamnosus lock0908 and l. casei lock0919 are recognized via toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (nod2) receptors and stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to produce cytokines in species- and strain-dependent manners. colonization of germ-free (gf) mice with a mixture of all three strains (lmix) improved the intestinal barrier by strengthening the apical junctional complexes of enterocytes and restoring the structures of microfilaments extending into the terminal web. mice colonized with lmix and sensitized to the bet v 1 allergen showed significantly lower levels of  allergen-specific ige, igg1 and igg2a and an elevated total iga level in the sera and intestinal lavages as well as an increased transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta level compared with the sensitized gf mice. splenocytes and mesenteric lymph node cells from the lmix-colonized mice showed the significant upregulation of tgf-beta after in vitro stimulation with bet v 1. our results show that lmix colonization improved the gut epithelial barrier and reduced allergic sensitization to bet v 1. furthermore, these findings were accompanied by the increased production of circulating and secretory iga and the regulatory cytokine tgf-beta. thus, this mixture of three lactobacillus strains shows potential for use in the prevention of increased gut permeability and the onset of allergies in humans.cellular & molecular immunology advance online publication, 23 march 2015; doi:10.1038/cmi.2015.09.

TI  == lactobacillus species: taxonomic complexity and controversial susceptibilities.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus is a taxonomically complex and is composed of over 170 species that cannot be easily differentiated phenotypically and often require molecular identification. although they are part of the normal human gastrointestinal and vaginal flora, they can also be occasional human pathogens.  they are extensively used in a variety of commercial products including probiotics. their antimicrobial susceptibilities are poorly defined in part because of their taxonomic complexity and are compounded by the different methods recommended by clinical laboratory standards institute and international dairy foundation. their use as probiotics for prevention of clostridium difficile infection is prevalent among consumers worldwide but raises the question of will  the use of any concurrent antibiotic effect their ability to survive. lactobacillus species are generally acid resistant and are able to survive ingestion. they are generally resistant to metronidazole, aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin with l. acidophilus being susceptible to penicillin and vancomycin, whereas l. rhamnosus and l. casei are resistant to metronidazole and vancomycin.

TI  == a decade of experience in primary prevention of clostridium difficile infection at a community hospital using the probiotic combination lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2 (bio-k+).
AB  == in august 2003, the 284-bed community hospital pierre-le gardeur (plgh) in quebec experienced a major outbreak associated with the clostridium difficile nap1/027/bi strain. augmented standard preventive measures (spms) were not able to control this outbreak. it was decided in february 2004 to give to every adult  inpatient on antibiotics, without any exclusion, a probiotic (bio-k+: lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285, lactobacillus casei lbc80r, and lactobacillus rhamnosus clr2) within 12 hours of the antibiotic prescription. augmented spms were continued. the use of the probiotic in addition to spms was associated with  a marked reduction of c. difficile infection (cdi). during the 10 years of observation, 44 835 inpatients received bio-k+, and the cdi rate at plgh declined from 18.0 cases per 10 000 patient-days and remained at low mean levels of 2.3 cases per 10 000 patient-days. additionally, 10-year data collected by the ministry of health in quebec comparing the cdi rate between quebec hospitals showed that cdi rates at plgh were consistently and continuously lower compared with those at similar hospitals. blood cultures were monitored at plgh for lactobacillus bacteremia through the 10 years' experience, and no lactobacillus bacteremias were detected. despite the limitation of an observational study, we concluded that the probiotic bio-k+ was safe and effective in decreasing our primary cdi rate.

TI  == amelioration of ovalbumin induced allergic symptoms in balb/c mice by potentially probiotic strains of lactobacilli.
AB  == to evaluate the antiallergic effect of newly characterised probiotic strains, lactobacillus fermentum nws29, lactobacillus casei nwp08 and lactobacillus rhamnosus nwp13, mice were divided into six experimental groups: control, ovalbumin (ova), nws29, nwp08, nwp13 and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg). mice were immunised and probiotics were administered via oral gavage followed by challenge  with ova. after last challenge with ova, inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf), recruitment of inflammatory cells in airways and ova-specific immunoglobulin e (ige) in serum were determined by giemsa, haematoxylin and eosin (he) staining, and elisa, respectively. relative mrna expression of interleukins (il-4, il-5, il-10, il-13 and il-17), transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) in lung and spleen tissue was determined by real time rt-pcr. ova-specific ige levels, recruitment of eosinophils and mrna expressions of inflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased in ova-exposed mice compared with the control group. administration of  nws29 and nwp13 suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration in airways and balf, and level of ova-specific ige in serum of ova-exposed mice. furthermore, nws29 and nwp13 also abrogated the mrna expression of 1l-4, il-5, il-13 and tgf-beta in mice immunised and exposed to ova. our findings suggest that nws29 and nwp13 might be good candidates for the prevention of allergic airway inflammation.

TI  == folate content and retention in commonly consumed vegetables in the south pacific.
AB  == this paper reports the effect of boiling and frying on the retention of folate in commonly consumed fijian vegetables (drumstick leaves, taro leaves, bele leaves,  amaranth leaves, fern/ota, okra and french bean). the folate content was determined by microbiological assay (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus) and tri-enzyme (protease, alpha-amylase and chicken pancreas conjugase) extraction treatment. the folate loss varied among the vegetables from 10-64% on boiling while 1-36% on frying. the higher folate loss was observed during boiling. the folate content in the water derived after boiling different vegetables ranged from 11.9 +/- 0.5 to 61.6 +/- 2.5 mug/100ml. the folate loss on boiling was accounted for in the cooking water. the predominant way of folate loss on boiling was leaching rather than thermal degradation which makes boiling the better choice of cooking the studied vegetables for folate intake, provided the cooking  water is consumed together with the vegetables.

TI  == perioperative synbiotics decrease postoperative complications in periampullary neoplasms: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == periampullary neoplasms are rapidly progressive tumors with a poor prognosis and  high morbidity and mortality rates, which have a negative influence on patient outcomes. some probiotics and prebiotics have the ability to protect the intestinal barrier and prevent bacterial translocation, infection, and postoperative complications. we evaluated the use of synbiotics in a prospective, double-blind study of patients undergoing surgery for periampullary neoplasms (pns) and assessed the effect of these agents on nutritional status, postoperative complications, antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and mortality. patients were randomized to receive probiotics and prebiotics-synbiotics--group s [lactobacillus acidophilus 10, 1 x 10(9)cfu, lactobacillus rhamnosus hs 111, 1 x 10(9) cfu, lactobacillus casei 10, 1 x 10(9)  cfu, bifidobacterium bifidum, 1 x 10(9)cfu, and fructooligosaccharides (fos) 100  mg]--or placebo-controls--group c, twice daily, for a total of 14 days. risk, clinical status, and postoperative complication rates were assessed. twenty-three patients were allocated to each group. the incidence of postoperative infection was significantly lower in group s (6 of 23 patients, 26.1%) than in group c (16  of 23 patients, 69.6%) (p = 0.00). duration of antibiotic therapy was also shorter in group s (mean = 9 days vs. 15 days in group c; p = 0.01). noninfectious complications were less common in group s (6 of 23 vs. 14 of 23 patients in group c; p = 0.03). mean length of hospital stay was 12 +/- 5 days in group s vs. 23 +/- 14 days in group c (p = 0.00). no deaths occurred in group s,  whereas 6 deaths occurred in group c (p = 0.02). perioperative administration of  synbiotics reduces postoperative mortality and complication rates in patients undergoing surgery for pns.

TI  == melting curve analysis of a groel pcr fragment for the rapid genotyping of strains belonging to the lactobacillus casei group of species.
AB  == lactobacillus casei group (lcs) consists of three phylogenetically closely related species (l. casei, l. paracasei, and l. rhamnosus), which are widely used in the dairy and probiotic industrial sectors. strategies to easily and rapidly characterize lcs are therefore of interest. to this aim, we developed a method according to a technique known as high resolution melting analysis (hrma), which  was applied to a 150 bp groel gene fragment. the analysis was performed on 53 lcs strains and 29 strains representatives of species that are commonly present in dairy and probiotic products and can be most probably co-isolated with lcs strains. dna amplification was obtained only from lcs strains, demonstrating the  specificity of the groel primers designed in this study. the hrma clustered lcs strains in three groups that exactly corresponded to the species of the l. casei  group. a following hrma separated the 39 l. paracasei strains in two well distinct intraspecific groups, indicating the possible existence of at least two  distinct genotypes inside the species. nonetheless, the phenotypic characterization demonstrated that the genotypes do not correspond to the two l.  paracasei subspecies, namely paracasei and tolerans. in conclusion, the melting curve analysis developed in this study is demonstrably a simple, labor-saving, and rapid strategy obtain the genotyping of a bacterial isolate and simultaneously potentially confirm its affiliation to the l. casei group of species. the application of this method to a larger collection of strains may validate the possibility to use the proposed hrma protocol for the taxonomic discrimination of l. casei group of species. in general, this study suggests that hrma can be a suitable technique for the genetic typization of lactobacillus strains.

TI  == [biological effect of extracellular peptide factor from lateococcus japonicas subsp. casei on probiotic bacteria].
AB  == the biological effect of the extracellular peptide reactivating factor (rf) from  luteococcus casei on cells of probiotic cultures was studied. the rf showed the protective and reactivating effects on the bifidobacterium bifidum cells under the action of bile salts and an acidic stress. also, it acted as a cryoprotector  during lyophilisation and long-term culture storage. the rf and the l. casei culture liquid (cl) were shown to have bifidogenic properties. the degree of protection and reactivation of lactic-acid bacteria under the action of bile salts depended on the particular strain properties. the maximum degree of protection (more than thirteen-fold) and reactivation (close to three-fold) was found in lactobacillus casei, while the minimum values were characteristic of lactobacillus reuterii. the resistance of lactobacilli to bile was increased in the row of l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. reuterii  correlating with the rf protection degree.

TI  == functional properties of peanut fractions on the growth of probiotics and foodborne bacterial pathogens.
AB  == various compounds found in peanut (arachis hypogaea) have been shown to provide multiple benefits to human health and may influence the growth of a broad range of gut bacteria. in this study, we investigated the effects of peanut white kernel and peanut skin on 3 strains of lactobacillus and 3 major foodborne enteric bacterial pathogens. significant (p < 0.05) growth stimulation of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus was observed in the presence of 0.5% peanut flour (pf) made from peanut white kernel, whereas 0.5% peanut skin extract (pse) exerted the inhibitory effect on the growth of these beneficial microbes. we also found that within 72 h, pf inhibited growth of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec), while pse significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited listeria monocytogenes but promoted the growth of both ehec and salmonella typhimurium. the cell adhesion and invasion abilities of 3 pathogens to the host cells were also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by 0.5% pf and 0.5%  pse. these results suggest that peanut white kernel might assist in improving human gut flora as well as reducing ehec, whereas the beneficial effects of peanut skins require further research and investigation.

AB  == objectives: recurrent cholangitis may aggravate cholestatic liver cirrhosis in biliary atresia (ba) after the kasai operation. this pilot study aimed to investigate whether lactobacillus casei rhamnosus has the prophylactic efficacy for recurrent cholangitis in comparison with the conventional neomycin prophylaxis. methods: twenty jaundice-free patients with ba ages 0 to 3 years who underwent a kasai operation were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups with 10 patients each: neomycin (25 mg . kg . day for 4 days/wk) and l casei rhamnosus (8 x 10 colony-forming unit per day) groups. the treatment duration was 6 months. bacterial stool cultures were performed before treatment and 1, 3, and 6 months after starting treatment. in addition, 10 patients with ba with similar status but without prophylaxis served as the historical control group. results: in the lactobacillus group, 2 patients (20%, mean 0.03 +/- 0.07 episodes per month) developed cholangitis during the study period, with the same frequency as in the  neomycin group and significantly lower than that in the control group (80%, p = 0.005, mean 0.22 +/- 0.16 episodes per month). the mean change in body weight z score during the 6 months in the lactobacillus group was 0.97 +/- 0.59, which was significantly better than that in the control group (-0.01 +/- 0.79, p = 0.006).  in bacterial stool cultures, the lactobacillus and escherichia coli populations significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in the lactobacillus group.  conclusions: the use of l casei rhamnosus was as effective as neomycin in preventing cholangitis in patients with ba who underwent kasai operation, and therefore could be considered as a potential alternative prophylactic regimen.

TI  == potentially probiotic and bioprotective lactic acid bacteria starter cultures antagonise the listeria monocytogenes adhesion to ht29 colonocyte-like cells.
AB  == the capability of five lactic acid bacteria (lab) to counteract the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes to the epithelial intestinal cell line ht29 was studied. the highest adhesion ability to ht29 was achieved by the intestinal strain lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679, followed by the meat-derived strains lactobacillus sakei ctc494 and enterococcus faecium ctc8005. surprisingly, the meat strains showed significantly better adhesion to ht29 than two faecal isolates of lactobacillus casei and even significantly higher than the reference  strain l. rhamnosus gg. additionally, the anti-listerial, bacteriocin-producer starter culture l. sakei ctc494 was able to significantly reduce the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes to ht29 in experiments of exclusion, competition and inhibition. the performance was better than the faecal isolate l. rhamnosus ctc1679. our results reinforce the fact that the ability of lab to interact with a host epithelium model, as well as to antagonise with foodborne pathogens, is a strain-specific characteristic. additionally, it is underlined that this trait is not dependent on the origin of the bacterium, since some food lab behave better than intestinal ones. therefore, the search for novel strains in food niches is a suitable approach to find those with potential health benefits. these strains are likely pre-adapted to the food environment, which would make their inclusion in the formulation of probiotic foods more feasible.

TI  == high resolution melting analysis (hrm) as a new tool for the identification of species belonging to the lactobacillus casei group and comparison with species-specific pcrs and multiplex pcr.
AB  == the correct identification and characterisation of bacteria is essential for several reasons: the classification of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has changed significantly over the years, and it is important to distinguish and define them  correctly, according to the current nomenclature, avoiding problems in the interpretation of literature, as well as mislabelling when probiotic are used in  food products. in this study, species-specific pcr and hrm (high-resolution melting) analysis were developed to identify strains belonging to the lactobacillus casei group and to classify them into l. casei, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. hrm analysis confirmed to be a potent, simple, fast and economic tool for microbial identification. in particular, 201 strains, collected from international collections and attributed to the l. casei  group, were examined using these techniques and the results were compared with consolidated molecular methods, already published. seven of the tested strains don't belong to the l. casei group. among the remaining 194 strains, 6 showed inconsistent results, leaving identification undetermined. all the applied techniques were congruent for the identification of the vast majority of the tested strains (188). notably, for 46 of the strains, the identification differed from the previous attribution.

AB  == the influence of the wooden equipment used for the traditional cheese manufacturing from raw milk was evaluated on the variations of chemico-physical characteristics and microbial populations during the ripening of caciocavallo palermitano cheese. milk from two farms (a, extensive; b, intensive) was processed in traditional and standard conditions. chemical and physical traits of cheeses were affected by the farming system and the cheese making technology, and changed during ripening. content in nacl and n soluble was lower, and paste consistency higher in cheese from the extensive farm and traditional technology,  whereas ripening increased the n soluble and the paste yellow and consistency. the ripening time decreased the number of all lactic acid bacteria (lab) groups,  except enterococci detected at approximately constant levels (10(4) and 10(5) cfu g(-1) for standard and traditional cheeses, respectively), till 120 d of ripening. in all productions, at each ripening time, the levels detected for enterococci were lower than those for the other lab groups. the canonical discriminant analysis of chemical, physical and microbiological data was able to  separate cheeses from different productions and ripening time. the dominant lab were isolated, phenotypically characterised and grouped, genetically differentiated at strain level and identified. ten species of lab were found and  the strains detected at the highest levels were pediococcus acidilactici and lactobacillus casei. ten strains, mainly belonging to lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus fermentum showed an antibacterial activity. the comparison of the polymorphic profiles of the lab strains isolated from the wooden vat with those of the strains collected during maturation, showed the persistence of three enterococci in traditional cheeses, with enterococcus faecalis found at dominant  levels over the enterococcus population till 120 d; the absence of these strains  in the standard productions evidenced the contribution of vat lab during caciocavallo palermitano cheese ripening.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactobacillus plantarum dmdl 9010, a strain with efficient nitrite degradation capacity.
AB  == nitrites commonly found in food, especially in fermented vegetables, are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. a lactobacillus strain (lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010) was previously isolated from fermented vegetables by our group, and is not yet fully characterized. a number of phenotypical and genotypical approaches were employed to characterize lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010. its nitrite degradation capacity was compared with four other lactobacillus strains, including lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 719, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricu 1.83, streptococcus thermophilus 1.204, and lactobacillus plantarum 8140, on mrs medium. compared to these four lactobacillus strains, lactobacillus  sp. dmdl 9010 had a significantly higher nitrite degradation capacity (p<0.001).  based on 16s rdna sequencing and sequence comparison, lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 was identified as either lactobacillus plantarum or lactobacillus pentosus. to further identify this strain, the flanking regions (922 bp and 806 bp upstream and downstream, respectively) of the l-lactate dehydrogenase 1 (l-ldh1) gene were amplified and sequenced. lactobacillus sp. dmdl 9010 had 98.92 and 76.98% sequence identity in the upstream region with l. plantarum wcfs1 and l. pentosus  ig1, respectively, suggesting that lactobacillu sp. dmdl 9010 is an l. plantarum  strain. it was therefore named l. plantarum dmdl 9010. our study provides a platform for genetic engineering of l. plantarum dmdl 9010, in order to further improve its nitrite degradation capacity.

TI  == inhibitory activity in vitro of probiotic lactobacilli against oral candida under different fermentation conditions.
AB  == clinical studies have shown that probiotics positively affect oral health by decreasing gum bleeding and/or reducing salivary counts of certain oral pathogens. our aim was to investigate the inhibitory effect of six probiotic lactobacilli against opportunistic oral candida species. sugar utilisation by both lactobacilli and candida was also assessed. agar overlay assay was utilised  to study growth inhibition of candida albicans, candida glabrata and candida krusei by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus  reuteri sd2112, lactobacillus brevis cd2, lactobacillus bulgaricus lb86 and l. bulgaricus lb lact. the inhibitory effect was measured at ph 5.5, 6.4, and 7.2, respectively, and in the presence of five different carbohydrates in growth medium (glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, and sorbitol). growth and final ph values were measured at two-hour time points to 24 h. l. rhamnosus gg showed the  strongest inhibitory activity in fructose and glucose medium against c. albicans, followed by l. casei shirota, l. reuteri sd2112 and l. brevis cd2. none of the lactobacilli tested affected the growth of c. krusei. only l. rhamnosus gg produced slight inhibitory effect on c. glabrata. the lower ph values led to larger inhibition zones. sugar fermentation profiles varied between the strains.  l. casei shirota grew in the presence of all sugars tested, whereas l. brevis cd2 could utilise only glucose and fructose. all candida species metabolised the available sugars but the most rapid growth was observed with c. glabrata. the results suggest that commercially available probiotics differ in their inhibitory activity and carbohydrate utilisation; the above properties are modified by different ph values and sugars with more pronounced inhibition at lower ph.

TI  == impact of different cryoprotectants on the survival of freeze-dried lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus casei/paracasei during long-term storage.
AB  == the production of long shelf-life highly concentrated dried probiotic/starter cultures is of paramount importance for the food industry. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effect of glucose, lactose, trehalose, and skim milk applied alone or combined upon the survival of potentially probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus ctc1679, lactobacillus casei/paracasei ctc1677 and l. casei/paracasei ctc1678 during freeze-drying and after 39 weeks of storage at 4 and 22 degrees c. immediately after freeze-drying, the percentage of survivors was very high (>/=94%) and only slight differences were observed among strains and cryoprotectants. in contrast, during storage, survival in the dried state depended on the cryoprotectant, temperature and strain. for all the protectants assayed, the stability of the cultures was remarkably higher when stored under refrigeration (4 degrees c). under these conditions, skim milk alone or supplemented with trehalose or lactose showed the best performance (reductions </=0.9 log units after 39 weeks of storage). the lowest survival was observed during non-refrigerated storage and with glucose and glucose plus milk; no viable cells left at the end of the storage period. thus, freeze-drying in the presence  of appropriate cryoprotectants allows the production of long shelf-life highly concentrated dried cultures ready for incorporation in high numbers into food products as starter/potential probiotic cultures.

TI  == probiotics for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is common in intensive care units (icus). some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of vap. several additional published studies have demonstrated that probiotics are safe and efficacious in preventing vap in icus. we aimed to systematically summarise the results of all available data to generate the best evidence for the prevention of vap. objectives: to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for preventing vap. search methods: we searched central (2014, issue 8), medline (1948 to september week 1, 2014) and embase (2010 to september 2014). selection criteria: randomised controlled trials (rcts) comparing probiotics with placebo or another control (excluding rcts that use probiotics in both study groups) to prevent vap. data collection and analysis: two review authors independently assessed eligibility and the quality of trials, and extracted data. main results: we included eight rcts, with 1083 participants. all studies compared a form of probiotic (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus; lactobacillus plantarum; synbiotic 2000forte; ergyphilus; combination bifidobacterium longum +  lactobacillus bulgaricus + streptococcus thermophilus) versus a control group (placebo; glutamine; fermentable fibre; peptide; chlorhexidine). the analysis of  all rcts showed that the use of probiotics decreased the incidence of vap (odds ratio (or) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.52 to 0.95, low quality evidence). however, the aggregated results were uncertain for icu mortality (or 0.84, 95% ci 0.58 to 1.22 very low quality evidence), in-hospital mortality (or 0.78, 95% ci 0.54 to 1.14, very low quality evidence), incidence of diarrhoea (or 0.72, 95% ci 0.47 to 1.09, very low quality evidence), length of icu stay (mean difference (md) -1.60, 95% ci -6.53 to 3.33, very low quality evidence), duration of mechanical ventilation (md -6.15, 95% ci -18.77 to 6.47, very low quality evidence) and antibiotic use (or 1.23, 95% ci 0.51 to 2.96, low quality evidence). antibiotics for vap were used for a shorter duration (in days) when participants received probiotics in one small study (md -3.00, 95% ci -6.04 to 0.04). however, the ci of the estimated effect was too wide to exclude no difference with probiotics. there were no reported events of nosocomial probiotic infections in any included study.the overall methodological quality of the included studies, based on our 'risk of bias' assessments, was moderate with half of the included studies rated as a 'low' risk of bias; however, we rated four included studies as a 'high' risk of bias across one or more of the domains. the  study limitations, differences in probiotics administered and participants, and small sample sizes across the included studies mean that the power to detect a trend of overall effect may be limited and chance findings cannot be excluded.to  explore the influence of some potential confounding factors in the studies, we conducted an intention-to-treat (itt) analysis, which did not change the inference of per-protocol analysis. however, our sensitivity analysis did not indicate a significant difference between groups for instances of vap. authors' conclusions: evidence suggests that use of probiotics is associated with a reduction in the incidence of vap. however, the quality of the evidence is low and the exclusion of the one study that did not provide a robust definition of vap increased the uncertainty in this finding. the available evidence is not clear regarding a decrease in icu or hospital mortality with probiotic use. three trials reported on the incidence of diarrhoea and the pooled results indicate no  clear evidence of a difference. the results of this meta-analysis do not provide  sufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the efficacy and safety of probiotics  for the prevention of vap in icu patients.

AB  == ready-to-eat foods have nowadays become a significant portion of the diet. accordingly, nutritional composition of these food categories should be well-known, in particular its folate content. however, there is a broad lack of folate data in food composition tables and databases. a total of 21 fresh-cut vegetable and fruit packed products were analysed for total folate (tf) content using a validated method that relies on the folate-dependent growth of chloramphenicol-resistant lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus (ncimb 10463). mean tf content ranged from 10.0 to 140.9mug/100g for the different matrices on a fresh weight basis. higher tf quantity, 140.9-70.1mug/100g, was found in spinach, rocket, watercress, chard and broccoli. significant differences were observed between available data for fresh vegetables and fruits from food composition tables or databases and the analysed results for fresh-cut packed products. supplied data support the potential of folate-rich fresh-cut ready-to-eat vegetables to increase folate intake significantly.

TI  == the efficacy of ampicillin and lactobacillus casei rhamnosus in the active management of preterm premature rupture of membranes remote from term.
AB  == background: we aimed to investigate the treatment efficacy of ampicillin prophylaxis accompanied by lactobacillus casei rhamnosus over the latency period  following preterm premature rupture of membranes (pprom). methods: records of 40  patients who presented with pprom between 23(0/7)-31(6/7) weeks were analyzed retrospectively. patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n=20), treated with ampicillin; and group 2 (n=20), treated with ampicillin plus l. casei rhamnosus. clinical and laboratory parameters were compared. delta (delta) values of each laboratory parameter were calculated by subtracting the value at delivery from the values at admission to the clinic. results: gestational weeks at delivery (28.1 +/- 0.3 weeks versus 31.5 +/- 0.4 weeks), latency periods (12.3 +/- 1.5 days versus 41.4 +/- 4.4 days), 5-minute apgar scores (6.8 +/- 0.1 versus 7.8 +/- 0.1), and birth weights (1,320 +/- 98 g versus 1,947 +/- 128 g) were significantly higher in group 2. white blood cell (wbc) (12,820 +/- 353/mm(3) versus 11,107 +/- 298/mm(3)), and neutrophil counts (10.7 +/- 0.5 x 10(3)/l versus 8.2 +/- 0.5 x 10(3)/l) were significantly lower in group 2 at delivery. the deltawbc (2,295 +/- 74/mm(3) versus -798 +/-- 406/mm(3)), deltac-reactive protein (5 +/- 0.04 mg/l versus 1.6 +/- 0.2 mg/l), and deltaneutrophil (3 +/- 0.2 x 10(3)/l versus 0.2 +/-- 0.1 x 10(3)/l) were significantly lower in group 2. conclusion: it seems that addition of l. casei rhamnosus to ampicillin prolongs the latency period in patients with pprom remote from term.

TI  == a new risk factor for neonatal vancomycin-resistant enterococcus colonisation: bacterial probiotics.
AB  == abstract objective: vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) colonisation can be controlled with strict adherence to infection control measures. we describe a vre outbreak coincident with bacterial probiotic trial. relationship between probiotic and vre colonisation, and other possible risk factors were investigated. methods: two hundred and ten infants with gestational age less than 32 weeks had been randomised for a trial with probiotic preparation containing lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium lactis, fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, colostrums and lactoferrin (nbl probiotic atp(r); nobel, istanbul, turkey) between february  2012 and august 2013 when a vre outbreak also took place. the existence of a relationship between this probiotic preparation and vre colonisation was investigated. results: the begining and end of the outbreak were coincident with  the beginning and end of the probiotic trial. demographic and clinical features of neonates did not differ between vre colonised (n = 94) and non-colonised infants (n = 116) except for vancomycin (p = 0.012) and probiotic (p < 0.001) use. conclusions: probiotic and vancomycin exposure were significant risk factors for vre colonisation. the acquisition and transfer of resistance genes of bacteria may be mediated by probiotics. therefore, the safety of probiotics is a  concern and should be investigated further.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus l34 and lactobacillus casei l39 suppress clostridium difficile-induced il-8 production by colonic epithelial cells.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile is the main cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea and colitis known as c. difficile-associated disease (cdad).with increased severity and failure of treatment in cdad, new approaches for prevention and treatment, such as the use of probiotics, are needed. since the pathogenesis of cdad involves an inflammatory response with a massive influx of neutrophils recruited by interleukin (il)-8, this study aimed to investigate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus spp. on the suppression of il-8 production in response to c. difficile infection. results: we screened lactobacillus conditioned media from 34 infant fecal isolates for the ability to suppress c. difficile-induced il-8 production from ht-29 cells. factors produced by two vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli, l. rhamnosus l34 (lr-l34) and l.casei l39 (lc-l39), suppressed the  secretion and transcription of il-8 without inhibiting c. difficile viability or  toxin production. conditioned media from lr-l34 suppressed the activation of phospho-nf-kappab with no effect on phospho-c-jun. however, lc-l39 conditioned media suppressed the activation of both phospho-nf-kappab and phospho-c-jun. conditioned media from lr-l34 and lc-l39 also decreased the production of c. difficile-induced gm-csf in ht-29 cells. immunomodulatory factors present in the  conditioned media of both lr-l34 and lc-l39 are heat-stable up to 100 degrees c and > 100 kda in size. conclusions: our results suggest that l. rhamnosus l34 and l. casei l39 each produce factors capable of modulating inflammation stimulated by c. difficile. these vancomycin-resistant lactobacillus strains are potential probiotics for treating or preventing cdad.

TI  == fermentation adaptability of three probiotic lactobacillus strains to oat, germinated oat and malted oat substrates.
AB  == functional foods targeting the improvement of gastrointestinal health are widely  recognized; of these, dairy-based probiotics are the most popular. thus, the design of nondairy probiotics applying fruits, vegetables and cereals has raised  great interest in the healthy food sector. the objective of this work was to assess the potential of germinated and malted oat substrates to support the growth of the probiotic cultures lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus. fermentations were carried out with distinctive oat  substrates at inoculum levels of 3, 5 and 7% v/v, substrate concentrations of 3,  5 and 7% w/v and with sucrose addition 1.5% w/v. lag phase profiles, maximum growth rates and maximal growths were evaluated; protein and sugar contents were  also quantified. there was no significant effect (p > 0.05) of the inoculum size  on the fermentation kinetics; however, oat media significantly affected the growth kinetics. in simple oat media, lact. acidophilus exhibited biphasic growth patterns. lactobacillus growth patterns were significantly affected (p < 0.05) by the supplementation with protein sources. the germination and malting processes significantly improved oats nutrient characteristics demonstrating to be adequate substrates for the fermentation with probiotic lactobacilli. significance and impact of the study: in this work, the effect of oat media composition and fermentation conditions on the growth kinetics of three probiotic lactobacilli was determined. the variation in the inoculum levels did not have a significant effect on the probiotic cultures growth. results revealed that protein supplemented simple, germinated and malted oat enhanced the cell viability of the probiotic lactobacilli; lactobacillus casei exhibited better growth adaptability. the results also highlight that different weight in volume oat substrate concentrations has particular effects on lact. casei growth kinetics. our results contribute to a better understanding of oat-based media formulations as substrates for probiotic cultures.

AB  == this work evaluated the capacity of two probiotic strains, lactobacillus casei crl431 and lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1506, to protect against myelosuppression and immunosuppression in cyclophosphamide (cy)-treated mice. changes in mature granulocytes and progenitor cells in bone marrow (bm) and blood were studied. in  addition, the ability of probiotics to accelerate the recovery of the immune response against the opportunistic pathogen candida albicans was evaluated. we demonstrated for the first time that the preventive treatment with immunomodulatory lactobacilli such as l. casei crl431 or l. rhamnosus crl1506 was able to increase immature myeloid progenitors in the bm, allowing an early recovery of myeloid cells after cy administration. probiotic lactobacilli were also capable to induce an early recovery of neutrophils in blood, improve phagocytic cells recruitment to infectious sites and increase the resistance against the opportunistic pathogen c. albicans. although deeper studies regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of probiotic actions are needed, these findings support the idea that strains like crl431 and crl1506 may accelerate the recovery of cy-caused immunosuppression by immunopotentiating myeloid cells. then, probiotic lactobacilli have the potential to be used as alternatives for lessening chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression in cancer patients.

TI  == spacba sequence instability and its relationship to the adhesion efficiency of lactobacillus casei group isolates to caco-2 cells.
AB  == the ability to adhere to enterocytes is one of the key features of probiotics. this process involves a number of factors, among which the important role of pili was demonstrated. some lactobacillus species are confirmed to have heterotrimeric spacba type pili. the aim of this study was to identify spacba pili in strains of selected lactobacillus spp. and assess the impact of their presence and sequence  polymorphism on the adhesion of these strains to enterocytes. total 20 bacterial  strains of l. rhamnosus, l. casei and l. paracasei were tested. the presence of pilus specific proteins coding genes spaa, spab and spac was verified by pcr in order to identify the presence of sequence polymorphism in the genes possibly affecting the structure of the spacba pilus. to correlate spacba polymorphism to  adhesion capability the adhesion assay was carried out using caco-2 cell line. the effectiveness of the adhesion was measured using a scintillation counter. the lactobacillus strains analyzed showed the adhesion to caco-2 enterocytes capability from 0.6% to 19.6%. the presence of spacba pili is a factor increasing the adhesion efficiency of lactobacillus spp. to caco-2 enterocytes. lack of these structures on the surface of bacterial cells results in the reduction in adhesion efficiency, indicating its important role in the adhesion process. but not in all cases the correlation between the presence of protein spacba structures and adhesion efficiency was observed, what may indicate the important  role of other factors in adhesion of analyzed strains to caco-2 cells.

TI  == a comparative study of the effect of probiotics on cariogenic biofilm model for preventing dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is induced by oral biofilm containing streptococcus mutans. probiotic bacteria were mainly studied for effect on the gastrointestinal tract and have been known to promote human health. however, the information of probiotics for oral health has been lack yet. in this study, we investigated influence of various probiotics on oral bacteria or cariogenic biofilm and evaluated candidate probiotics for dental caries among them. the antimicrobial activity of the spent culture medium of probiotics for oral streptococci was performed. probiotics were added during the biofilm formation with salivary bacteria including s. mutans. the oral biofilms were stained with a fluorescent dye and observed using the confocal laser scanning microscope. to count bacteria  in the biofilm, the bacteria were plated on msb and bhi agar plates after disrupting the biofilm and cultivated. glucosyltransferases (gtfs) expression of  s. mutans and integration of lactobacilli into the biofilm were evaluated by real-time rt-pcr. among probiotics, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited growth of oral streptococci. moreover, lactobacillus species strongly inhibited formation of cariogenic biofilm model. the expression of gtfs was significantly reduced by lactobacillus rhamnosus. the integration of l. rhamnosus into the biofilm model did not exhibit. however, l. acidophilus and l casei integrated into the biofilm model. these results suggest that l. rhamnosus may inhibit oral  biofilm formation by decreasing glucan production of s. mutans and antibacterial  activity and did not integrate into oral biofilm, which can be a candidate for caries prevention strategy.

AB  == one hundred eighty four strains belonging to the species lactobacillus casei, l.  paracasei and l. rhamnosus were screened for their ability to grow under aerobic  conditions, in media containing heme and menaquinone and/or compounds generating  reactive oxygen species (ros), in order to identify respiratory and oxygen-tolerant phenotypes. most strains were able to cope with aerobic conditions and for many strains aerobic growth and heme or heme/menaquinone supplementation increased biomass production compared to anaerobic cultivation. only four l. casei strains showed a catalase-like activity under anaerobic, aerobic and respiratory conditions and were able to survive in presence of h2o2 (1 mm). almost all l. casei and l. paracasei strains tolerated menadione (0.2 mm) and most tolerated pyrogallol (50 mm), while l. rhamnosus was usually resistant only to the latter compound. this is the first study in which an extensive screening of oxygen and oxidative stress tolerance of members of the l. casei group has been carried out. results allowed the selection of strains showing the  typical traits of aerobic and respiratory metabolism (increased ph and biomass under aerobic or respiratory conditions) and unique oxidative stress response properties. aerobic growth and respiration may confer technological and physiological advantages in the l. casei group and oxygen-tolerant phenotypes could be exploited in several food industry applications.

TI  == efficacy of probiotic therapy on atopic dermatitis in children: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate a therapeutic efficacy of probiotics mixture (probiotics) in the treatment of children with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis (ad). methods:  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial with a washout period of 2 weeks and an intervention period for 6 weeks, conducted from november 2010 to october 2011. one hundred children with mild to moderate ad (2-9 years old) were randomly allocated to the probiotics (lactobacilluss casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and bifidobacterium lactis) or  placebo groups. the assessment of efficacy was based on the change in eczema area severity index (easi), visual analogue scale for pruritus (vasp), fecal cell counts of each strains (log10[cell counts/g stool]), and serum cytokine levels (interleukin-4 [il-4]; il-10; tumor necrosis factor alpha, [tnf-alpha]) in weeks  0 and 6. results: demographics and baseline characteristics at the week 0 were not significantly different between the 2 groups. the significant increments in fecal-cell counts were observed in the probiotcs group at week 6 (p=0.00), while  the cytokine levels between the 2 groups were not significantly different in week 6 (il-4, p=0.50; il-10, p=0.58; tnf-alpha, p=0.82). the probiotics significantly  improved clinical severity after 6 weeks' intervention of probiotics; however, the placebo group also showed significant improvement (easi; p=0.00, vasp; p=0.00). conclusions: our findings showed that probiotics successfully colonized  in the intestine after 6 weeks' intervention; nevertheless, we could not find an  additional therapeutic or immunomodulatory effects on the treatment of ad. further long-term studies will be necessary to clarify the therapeutic efficacy of probiotics.

TI  == beta-glucosidase activity and bioconversion of isoflavones during fermentation of soymilk.
AB  == background: lactobacillus rhamnosus c6 strain showed higher beta-glucosidase activity as well as biotransformation of isoflavones from glycones (daidzin and genistin) to aglycones (daidzein and genistein) in soymilk. however, l. rhamnosus c2 and lactobacillus casei ncdc297 also exhibited similar activity during soymilk fermentation. these three strains can be selected for the development of functional fermented soy foods enriched with aglycone forms of isoflavones, such  as soy yoghurt, soy cheese, soy beverages and soy dahi. results: the study determined beta-glucosidase activity of probiotic lactobacillus cultures for bioconversion of isoflavones to aglycones in fermenting soymilk medium. soymilk was fermented with six strains (l. rhamnosus c6 and c2, l. rhamnosus ncdc19 and ncdc24 and l. casei ncdc17 and ncdc297) at 37 degrees c for 12 h. the highest beta-glucosidase activity and isoflavone bioconversion after 12 h occurred by l.  rhamnosus c6 culture during fermentation in soymilk. increased isoflavone aglycone content in fermented soymilk is likely to improve the biological functionality of soymilk (e.g. antioxidant activity, alleviation of hormonal disorders in postmenopausal women, etc.). conclusion: lactobacillus rhamnosus c6  culture can be used for the development of functional fermented soy-based products.

TI  == the effect of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == objective: to compare the effects of five probiotic lactobacilli strains on the growth and biofilm formation of streptococcus mutans (ms). materials and methods: five probiotic lactobacilli bacteria (lb), lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus casei lc01, lactobacillus plantarum st-iii, lactobacillus paracasei lpc-37, and lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001, were used as test strains effecting on the streptococci strain s. mutans ua159 in this study. the effect of lb strains and their supernatants on the viability of the ms was evaluated. then, the effect of lb strains on the growth of ms biofilm formation was observed by fluorescence  microscope. results: all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) (p < 0.05). untreated (without ph adjustment and ultrafiltration) lb supernatants from all of the lb strains inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05) as well. after ph adjustment and ultrafiltration (treated), only supernatants from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 inhibited the growth of ms (p < 0.05). ms biofilm formation was also inhibited by all untreated supernatants and by the treated supernatants of l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus hn001 (p < 0.05). conclusion: all five probiotic lactobacilli strains inhibited the growth and biofilm formation of ms,  likely through the production of an acid environment, bacteriocin-like poly peptides, or both, and the effects on ms were dependent on the lb strains used.

TI  == characterization of nitrite degradation by lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus lcr 6013.
AB  == nitrites are potential carcinogens. therefore, limiting nitrites in food is critically important for food safety. the nitrite degradation capacity of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus lcr 6013 was investigated in pickle fermentation. after lcr 6013 fermentation for 120 h at 37 degrees c, the nitrite  concentration in the fermentation system was significantly lower than that in the control sample without the lcr 6013 strain. the effects of nacl and vc on nitrite degradation by lcr 6013 in the de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) medium were also investigated. the highest nitrite degradations, 9.29 mg/l and 9.89 mg/l, were observed when nacl and vc concentrations were 0.75% and 0.02%, respectively in the mrs medium, which was significantly higher than the control group (p </= 0.01). electron capture/gas chromatography and indophenol blue staining were used to study the nitrite degradation pathway of lcr 6013. the nitrite degradation products contained n2o, but no nh4(+). the lcr 6013 strain completely degraded all nano2 (50.00 mg/l) after 16 h of fermentation. the enzyme activity of nir in  the periplasmic space was 2.5 times of that in the cytoplasm. our results demonstrated that l. casei subsp. rhamnosus lcr 6013 can effectively degrade nitrites in both the pickle fermentation system and in mrs medium by nir. nitrites are degraded by the lcr 6013 strain, likely via the nitrate respiration  pathway (no2(-)>no->n2o->n2), rather than the aammonium formation pathway (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, dnra), because the degradation products contain n2o, but not nh4(+).

TI  == anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  == a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal  microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == probiotic attributes of autochthonous lactobacillus rhamnosus strains of human origin.
AB  == the study was aimed at evaluating the probiotic potential of indigenous autochthonous lactobacillus rhamnosus strains isolated from infant feces and vaginal mucosa of healthy female. the survival of the selected strains and the two reference strains (l. rhamnosus gg and l. casei actimel) was 67-81 % at ph 2  and 70-80 % after passage through the simulated gastrointestinal fluid. these strains are able to grow in the presence of 4 % bile salt, 10 % nacl, and 0.6 % phenol. the cell surface of l. rhamnosus strains is hydrophilic in nature as revealed by bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbons (bath) assay. despite this, l. rhamnosus strains showed mucin adherence, autoaggregation and coaggregation properties that are strain-specific. in addition, they produce bile salt hydrolase (bsh) and beta-galactosidase activities. l. rhamnosus strains exhibit antimicrobial activity against food spoilage organisms and gastrointestinal pathogens, as well as candida and aspergillus spp. l. rhamnosus strains have similar antibiotic susceptibility pattern, and resistance to certain antibiotics  is intrinsic or innate. the strains are neither haemolytic nor producer of biogenic amines such as histamine, putrescine, cadaverine and tyramine. lyophilized cells of l. rhamnosus fb exhibited probiotic properties demonstrating potential of the strain for technological suitability and in the preparation of diverse probiotic food formulations.

TI  == immune system stimulation by probiotic microorganisms.
AB  == probiotic organisms are claimed to offer several functional properties including  stimulation of immune system. this review is presented to provide detailed informations about how probiotics stimulate our immune system. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, bifidobacterium lactis dr10, and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii are the most investigated probiotic cultures for their immunomodulation properties. probiotics can enhance nonspecific cellular immune response characterized by activation of macrophages, natural killer (nk) cells, antigen-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in strain-specific and dose-dependent manner. mixture and type (gram-positive and gram-negative) of probiotic organisms may induce different cytokine responses. supplementation of probiotic organisms in infancy could help prevent immune-mediated diseases in childhood, whereas their intervention in pregnancy could affect fetal immune parameters, such as cord blood interferon (ifn)-gamma levels, transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 levels, and breast milk immunoglobulin (ig)a. probiotics that can be delivered via fermented milk or yogurt could improve the gut mucosal immune system by increasing the number of iga(+) cells and cytokine-producing cells in the effector site of the intestine.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

AB  == the vaginal probiotics can increase the clinical and microbiological efficacy of  the therapeutic regimens used for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. the aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of the application of lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus (gynophilus--probiotic species lcr 35) in restoring the vaginal flora and prevention of relapses by female patients with anaerobic vaginal infection undergoing conventional (nitroimidazole) local and main therapy. methods: in the study were included 60 women with established amsel/nugent bacterial vaginosis who were randomized in two groups. the first group patients (n-30 beginning/n-25 controls) underwent a 5 day treatment with two daily peroral doses of metronidazole 500 mg, with local application of metronidazole ovules 1000 mg at the 1st and the 3rd day (m+m). in the second group (n-30 beginning/n-26 controls) the therapeutic regimen was the same as in the first group, with additional 7 day treatment with lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus - lcr 35. (gynophilus) vaginal ovules, two daily doses (m+m+g). results: 30% to 40% was the difference/enhance of the clinical efficacy according to the clinical indicators when lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus - lcr 35 was added to the standard nitroimidazole therapy. concerning the main clinical indicator: amsel criteria, the improvement after the therapy in the first group (m+m) was 60% (n-15) and in the second group (m+m+g) 88.5% (n-23). according to the microbiological indicators the improvement in the first group (m+m) based on the  vaginal flora evaluation (nugent score) was 60% (n-15) and in the second group, after the addition of lcr 35 it was 88.5% (n-23). conclusions: the application of gynophilus after conventional 5-nitroimidazole treatment for bacterial vaginosis  increased the clinical and microbiological efficacy of the therapy by 25% - 30%.  the microbial balance in the vaginal ecosystem was restored in the majority of patients (88%), which is a prerequisite for low percentage of bacterial vaginosis relapses.

AB  == a total of 109 lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces were identified by partial 16s rrna, cpn60 and/or phes sequencing. lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by enterococcus (38%). lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. a further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant  genus in this type of product. lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. the best strains according to the results obtained were lactobacillus casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678, lactobacillus  rhamnosus ctc1679, l. gasseri ctc1700, l. gasseri ctc1704, lactobacillus fermentum ctc1693. those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. l. casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678 and l. rhamnosus ctc1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) cfu/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.

TI  == tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter lactobacillus strains from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component  analysis.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of nslab previously isolated  from long ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses (22 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 lactobacillus paracasei, 3 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus harbinensis, and  2 lactobacillus fermentum). most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. the strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. no isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and bsh activity are unpaired traits. finally, nslab strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with escherichia coli and salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. a multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one l. casei and two l. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.

TI  == immunostimulatory cpg motifs in the genomes of gut bacteria and their role in human health and disease.
AB  == toll-like receptor (tlr) signalling plays an important role in epithelial and immune cells of the intestine. tlr9 recognizes unmethylated cpg motifs in bacterial dna, and tlr9 signalling maintains the gut epithelial homeostasis. here, we carried out a bioinformatic analysis of the frequency of cpg motifs in the genomes of gut commensal bacteria across major bacterial phyla. the frequency of potentially immunostimulatory cpg motifs (all cpg hexamers) or purine-purine-cg-pyrimidine-pyrimidine hexamers was linearly dependent on the genomic g+c content. we found that species belonging to proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria (including bifidobacteria) carried high counts of gtcgtt, the optimal motif stimulating human tlr9. we also found that enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus, whose strains have been marketed as probiotics, had high counts of gtcgtt motifs. as gut bacterial species differ significantly in their genomic content of cpg motifs, the overall load of cpg motifs in the intestine depends on the species assembly of microbiota and their cell numbers. the optimal cpg motif content of microbiota may depend on the host's physiological status and, consequently, on an adequate level of tlr9 signalling. we speculate that microbiota with increased numbers of microbes with cpg motif-rich dna could better support mucosal functions in healthy individuals and improve the t-helper  1 (th1)/th2 imbalance in allergic diseases. in autoimmune disorders, cpg motif-rich dna could, however, further increase the th1-type immune responsiveness. estimation of the load of microbe-associated molecular patterns,  including cpg motifs, in gut microbiota could shed new light on host-microbe interactions across a range of diseases.

AB  == background: clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) is a major public health problem because of significant morbidity and mortality, and many clinicians pay attention to lactobacillus as a potentially effective treatment. the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of lactobacillus in the prevention of cdad. methods: the databases medline, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, metaregister of controlled trials, national institutes of health, cnki, vip, and wanfang data were searched to locate all reported randomized controlled trials (rct) from 1990 to december 2012. only rct  in english and chinese using lactobacillus for the prevention of documented cdad  were considered for study inclusion. the data was analyzed by review manager and  spss software. results: seven placebo-controlled rcts that evaluated the prevention of cdad, which included 1486 subjects, accorded with inclusion and exclusion criteria. the mean age of the subjects ranged from 4.15 to 64.75 years  and the proportion of male subjects ranged from 42.0% to 59.1%. the total daily dose of lactobacillus ranged from 1.2x10(9)-1.2x10(12) colonyforming units (cfu). a low risk of bias was attributed to two studies and four studies evaluated a medium-level risk of bias. the combined risk ratio (rr) of developing cdad was significantly lower in subjects who received lactobacillus compared with subjects who received placebo (rr 0.38, 95% confidence interval (ci) 0.22-0.67). a combination regimen of lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and lactobacillus casei (l. casei) (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36) showed significant effect sizes for the prevention of cdad, while single regimens of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (l. rhamnosus) did not. across all trials, positive significant effects of lactobacillus were observed in the elderly subgroup (rr 0.05, 95% ci 0.01-0.36). whether the 1x10(12)-9x10(12) cfu/d lactobacillus could prevent cdad significantly or not was unclear. conclusion: there is a sufficient evidence to recommend lactobacillus (l. acidophilus and l. casei) as a prevention therapy for cdad.

AB  == there is concern that the bacterial colony counts present at the time of manufacture and listed on the probiotic package may not be reflective of the numbers viable colonies at the time of purchase and patient consumption thereby diminishing efficacy. we performed a colony count study of three separate samples of five different probiotics purchased from three different stores: bifidobacterium infantis (align((r))); lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and  lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) (bio-k+((r))); lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (culturelle((r))); saccharomyces boulardii (florastor((r))) and "l. acidophilus"  and "lactobacillus helveticus" (lactinex((r))). approximately 1 g of powder of each (lactinex((r)) tablets were crushed before testing) was reconstituted in sterile distilled water, serial 10-fold dilutions were prepared and plated in duplicate onto blood agar plates, with incubation for 48 h in an anaerobic chamber (except the saccharomyces which was incubated aerobically) after which colony counts were performed. the florastor((r)) packaging did not state an expected concentration and was found to have 9.2 x 10(9)-1.3 x 10(10) cfu/g. lactinex((r)), align((r)), bio-k+((r)), and culturelle((r)) had viable colony counts that were similar to those stated on the package.

TI  == molecular analysis and clinical significance of lactobacillus spp. recovered from clinical specimens presumptively associated with disease.
AB  == lactobacillus spp. are part of the normal human flora and are generally assumed to be nonpathogenic. we determined the genotypic identification of >100 lactobacillus isolates from clinical specimens in the context of presumed pathogenic potential (e.g., recovered as the single/predominant isolate from a sterile site or at >/=10(5) cfu/ml from urine). this study assessed the clinical  significance and the frequency of occurrence of each lactobacillus sp. we identified 16 species of lactobacillus by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, 10 of  which could not be associated with disease. while lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus paracasei were associated with infections, l. gasseri was also a common colonizing/contaminating species. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus delbrueckii were  associated with at least one infection. species commonly used in probiotic products (e.g., l. rhamnosus and l. casei) were identical, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, to our isolates associated with disease. human isolates of lactobacillus spp. have differing site associations and levels of clinical significance. knowing the niche and pathogenic potential of each lactobacillus sp. can be of importance to both clinical microbiology and the food and probiotic supplement industry.

TI  == comparison of fecundity and offspring immunity in zebrafish fed lactobacillus rhamnosus cicc 6141 and lactobacillus casei bl23.
AB  == to increase the knowledge of probiotic effects on zebrafish (danio rerio), we compare the effects of two probiotic strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus cicc 6141 (a highly adhesive strain) and lactobacillus casei bl23 (a weakly adhesive strain), on zebrafish reproduction and their offsprings' innate level of immunity to water-borne pathogens. during probiotics treatments from 7 to 28 days, both the lactobacillus strains, and especially l. casei bl23, significantly increased  fecundity in zebrafish: higher rates of egg ovulation, fertilization, and hatching were observed. increased densities of both small and large vitellogenic  follicles, seen in specimens fed either lactobacillus strain, demonstrated accelerated oocyte maturation. feeding either strain of lactobacillus upregulated gene expression of leptin, kiss2, gnrh3, fsh, lh, lhcgr, and paqr8, which were regarded to enhance fecundity and encourage oocyte maturation. concomitantly, the gene expression of bmp15 and tgfb1 was inhibited, which code for local factors that prevent oocyte maturation. the beneficial effects of the lactobacillus strains on fecundity diminished after feeding of the probiotics was discontinued, even for the highly adhesive gut lactobacillus strain. administering l. rhamnosus cicc 6141 for 28 days was found to affect the innate immunity of offspring derived from their parents, as evinced by a lower level of alkaline phosphatase activity in early larval stages. this study highlights the effects of probiotics  both upon the reproductive process and upon the offsprings' immunity during early developmental stages.

TI  == genomic adaptation of the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == lactobacillus casei, l. paracasei, and l. rhamnosus form a closely related taxonomic group (lactobacillus casei group) within the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli. here, we report the complete genome sequences of l. paracasei jcm 8130 and l. casei atcc 393, and the draft genome sequence of l.  paracasei com0101, all of which were isolated from daily products. furthermore, we re-annotated the genome of l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 (also known as l. rhamnosus gg), which we have previously reported. we confirmed that atcc 393 is distinct from other strains previously described as l. paracasei. the core genome of 10 completely sequenced strains of the l. casei group comprised 1,682 protein-coding genes. although extensive genome-wide synteny was found among the l. casei group, the genomes of atcc 53103, jcm 8130, and atcc 393 contained genomic islands compared with l. paracasei atcc 334. several genomic islands, including carbohydrate utilization gene clusters, were found at the same loci in the chromosomes of the l. casei group. the spacba pilus gene cluster, which was first identified in gg, was also found in other strains of the l. casei group, but several l. paracasei strains including com0101 contained truncated spac gene. atcc 53103 encoded a higher number of proteins involved in carbohydrate utilization compared with intestinal lactobacilli, and extracellular adhesion proteins, several of which are absent in other strains of the l. casei group. in  addition to previously fully sequenced l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei strains, the complete genome sequences of l. casei will provide valuable insights into the evolution of the l. casei group.

TI  == probiotic modulation of dendritic cell function is influenced by ageing.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) are critical for the generation of t-cell responses. dc function may be modulated by probiotics, which confer health benefits in immunocompromised individuals, such as the elderly. this study investigated the effects of four probiotics, bifidobacterium longum bv. infantis ccug 52486, b. longum sp 07/3, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (l.gg) and l. casei shirota (lcs), on  dc function in an allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction (mlr) model, using dcs and  t-cells from young and older donors in different combinations. all four probiotics enhanced expression of cd40, cd80 and ccr7 on both young and older dcs, but enhanced cytokine production (tgf-beta, tnf-alpha) by old dcs only. lcs  induced il-12 and ifngamma production by dc to a greater degree than other strains, while b. longum bv. infantis ccug 52486 favoured il-10 production. stimulation of young t cells in an allogeneic mlr with dc was enhanced by probiotic pretreatment of old dcs, which demonstrated greater activation (cd25) than untreated controls. however, pretreatment of young or old dcs with lps or probiotics failed to enhance the proliferation of t-cells derived from older donors. in conclusion, this study demonstrates that ageing increases the responsiveness of dcs to probiotics, but this is not sufficient to overcome the impact of immunosenescence in the mlr.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == anti-hiv-1 activity, protease inhibition and safety profile of extracts prepared  from rhus parviflora.
AB  == background: in the present study, extracts prepared from the leaves of rhus parviflora roxb. (anacardiaceae) were evaluated for their anti-hiv activity, which have been traditionally used for the treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. methods: aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts prepared from leaves of the plant were tested for their cytotoxicity and anti-hiv property using reporter gene based assays as well as human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls). further these extracts were evaluated for their ability to inhibit hiv-1 reverse transcriptase (rt) and protease activity. safety profile of the extracts was determined on viability of lactobacillus sp., secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by vaginal keratinocytes and transepithelial resistance. results: both aqueous (ic50 = 15 mug/ml) and 50% ethanolic (ic50 = 26 mug/ml) extracts prepared from leaves of r. parviflora showed anti-hiv activity in tzm-bl cells wherein the virus was treated with the extracts prior to infection. further, both the extracts also inhibited virus load in hiv infected cem-gfp cells and human pbls. the anti-hiv activity is mediated through inhibition of hiv-1 protease activity. both the extracts did not disturb the integrity of monolayer formed by intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells. the extracts when tested up to 100 mug/ml did not significantly reduce the viability of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. the extracts (100 mug/ml) did not reveal any cytotoxic effect on vaginal keratinocytes (vk2/e6e7). levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by vk2/e6e7 cells treated with both the plant extracts were within the non-inflammatory range. conclusions: the studies reported herein showed in vitro anti-hiv activity and preliminary safety profile  of the extracts prepared from the leaves of r. parviflora.

TI  == not only osmoprotectant: betaine increased lactate dehydrogenase activity and l-lactate production in lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are commonly used for industrial production of polymer-grade l-lactic acid. the present study tested the tween 80 alternative betaine in l-lactate production by several industrial lactobacilli. in flask fermentation of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus buchneri, lactobacillus lactis and lactobacillus rhamnosus, the betaine addition (2g/l) had similar osmoprotectant effect with tween 80 but had increased the lactate dehydrogenase activities and l-lactate production than tween 80 control. in fed-batch fermentation of l. casei, betaine supplementation improved the l-lactic acid titer to 190 g/l, the yield to 95.5% (g l-lactic acid/g glucose), the productivity to 2.6g/lh, and the  optical purity to 97.0%. the results demonstrated that supplementation of tween 80 alternative - betaine in the fermentation medium is feasible for industrial l-lactic acid fermentation by lactobacilli, which will improve the lactate production but will not increase the process costs and modify any process conditions.

AB  == the aim of this study was to explore diversity and dynamic of indigenous lab strains associated with a long ripened hard cheese produced from raw milk and undefined natural starter such as pdo grana padano cheese. samples of milk, curd, natural whey culture and cheeses (2nd, 6th, 9th and 13th months of ripening) were collected from 6 cheese factories in northern italy. dna was extracted from each  sample and from 194 lab isolates. trna(ala)-23s rdna-rflp was applied to identify isolates. strain diversity was assessed by (gtg)5 rep-pcr and rapd(p1)-pcr. finally, culture-independent lh-pcr (v1-v2 16s-rdna), was considered to explore structure and dynamic of the microbiota. grana padano lab were represented mainly by lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus acidilactici, while the structure and dynamic of microbiota at different localities was specific. the strength of this work is to have focused the study on isolates coming from more than one cheese factories rather than a high number of isolates  from one unique production. we provided a valuable insight into inter and intraspecies diversity of typical lab strains during ripening of traditional pdo  grana padano, contributing to the understanding of specific microbial ecosystem of this cheese.

TI  == effect of chestnut extract and chestnut fiber on viability of potential probiotic lactobacillus strains under gastrointestinal tract conditions.
AB  == the main challenge to probiotics, during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract, are the acidic gastric secretions of the stomach, and the bile salts released into the duodenum. the survival of the strains, in this phase, is strongly influenced by the food used for their delivery. this work is part of a project studying the development of novel food processes, based on the  use of chestnuts from cultivar "castagna di montella". in detail, the effect of indigestible chestnut fiber and of chestnut extract on the viability of selected  lactic acid bacteria strains was evaluated. among 28 cultures, twelve strains were selected, on the basis of tolerance to low ph values and bile salts, and submitted to exposition to simulated gastric or bile juice in presence of chestnut extract with or without immobilization in chestnut fiber. the presence of chestnut extract proved to play a significant role on the gastric tolerance improvement of lactobacilli. the recorded protective effect could not be simply related to the starch or reducing sugars content. rp-hplc demonstrated that in the chestnut flour, there are one or more hydrophobic peptides or oligopeptides,  which specifically offer a marked resistance to simulated gastric juice, albeit present at low concentration. these beneficial effects proved to be dependent by  the cultivar used to produce the flour.

TI  == [determination of folate content in ready-to-eat food products].
AB  == introduction: in the last years, the consumption of ready-to-eat foods has become an increasing part of the current spanish diet. accordingly, the nutritional composition of these food categories should be investigated in order to estimate  its contribution to vitamin and nutrient intakes, in particular its folate content. the broad lack of folate data in food composition tables and databases justifies this approach. objectives: the aim of this work was to screen the current availability and to supply new folate data in ready-to-eat commercial products in the spanish market. methods: seventeen ready-to-eat foods, including  mainly vegetable ingredients, were analysed for total folate content using a validated method that relies on lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus chloramphenicol-resistant folate dependent growth. the accuracy of the analytical procedure was checked using a certified reference material and by a recovery test. results: mean tf content ranged from 13.6 to 103.8 mug/100 g in different food matrices on a fresh weight basis. higher tf quantity was found for vegetable hamburguers, recipes including chickpeas, peas or artichockes. selected precooked products were also analysed after a soft heat treatment as recommended by the manufacter before its consumption. no significant differences were found in the folate content after processing. the coefficient of variation for the duplicates  of the same product was less than 15%. conclusion: folate content in ready-to-eat products indicates the potential to considerably increase folate intake by choosing folate-rich foods. there have been no previous reports on folate data in chilled ready-to-eat meals. the present data will assist dietary studies to estimate and evaluate the adequacy of population folate intakes.

TI  == synbiotic impact of tagatose on viability of lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg mediated by the phosphotransferase system (pts).
AB  == synbiotics, the combination of prebiotics and probiotics, has been shown to produce synergistic effects that promote gastrointestinal well-being of host. tagatose is a low calorie food ingredient with putative health-promoting benefits. herein, we investigated its synbiotic impact on the viability of lactobacillus casei 01 and lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and the potential mechanism involved. tagatose, as a synbiotic substrate, enhanced the growth of l. casei 01 and l. rhamnosus strain gg compared to other prebiotics. other gut-indigenous such as clostridium spp. readily utilized fructooligosaccharide (fos), the most widely used functional prebiotics, but not tagatose. additionally, tagatose enhanced probiotic functions of l. casei 01 and l. rhamnosus strain gg by reinforcing their attachment on ht-29 intestine epithelial cells and enhancing their cholesterol-lowering activities. whole transcriptome study and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) test showed  that the presence of tagatose in l. rhamnosus strain gg caused induction of a large number of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism including the phosphotransferase system (pts). collectively, these results indicate the tagatose enhanced the growth of l. casei 01 and l. rhamnosus strain gg and their  probiotic activities by activating tagatose-associated pts networks. importantly, this study highlights the potential application of tagatose and l. casei 01 and/or l. rhamnosus strain gg as a synbiotic partner in functional dairy foods (i.e. yogurt and cheese) and therapeutic dietary supplements.

TI  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria volatilomes produced using cheese components.
AB  == in long-ripened cheese, flavor formation occurs during ripening. the metabolism of lactic acid bacteria (lab) leads to the production of different compounds that contribute to the flavor of cheese. the contribution of lab to the formation of cheese flavor has previously been studied. however, the specific nonstarter lab (nslab) metabolic reactions in ripened cheese that lead to the formation of flavor compounds remain unclear. in ripened cheese, the nutrient sources available include small peptides or amino acids, citrate, lactate, free fatty acids, and starter lab cell lysis products. thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of nslab to produce volatile flavor compounds by using an in vitro system that used only the nutrients available in ripened cheese as the energy source. moreover, the potential contribution of the nslab volatilome on total cheese flavor is discussed. for this purpose, the production of volatile compounds on cheese-based medium (cbm) and on starter lab lysed cell medium (lcm) by 2 lactobacillus casei and 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus strains, previously isolated from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese, was investigated. the generated volatile compounds were analyzed with head-space gas chromatography mass spectrometry. overall, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and acids were the most abundant compounds produced. differences in volatilome production were found between nslab grown in lcm and cbm. the catabolic metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids were required for nslab growth on lcm. conversely, pyruvate metabolism was the main catabolic pathway that supported growth of nslab in cbm.  this study can be considered a first step toward a better understanding of how microbiota involved in the long ripening of cheese may contribute to the development of cheese flavor.

TI  == significant effect of ca2+ on improving the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the heat resistance of lactic acid bacteria (lab) has been extensively investigated due to its highly practical significance. reconstituted skim milk (rsm) has been found to be one of the most effective protectant wall materials for microencapsulating microorganisms during convective drying, such as spray drying. in addition to proteins and carbohydrate, rsm is rich in calcium. it is not clear which component is critical in the rsm protection mechanism. this study investigated the independent effect of calcium. ca(2+) was added to lactose solution to examine its influence on the heat resistance of lactobacillus rhamnosus zy, lactobacillus casei zhang, lactobacillus plantarum p8 and streptococcus thermophilus nd03. the results showed that certain ca(2+) concentrations enhanced the heat resistance of the lab strains to different extents, that is produced higher survival and shorter regrowth lag times of the bacterial cells. in some cases, the improvements were dramatic. more scientifically insightful and more intensive instrumental study of the ca(2+) behavior around and in the cells should be carried out in the near future. in the meantime, this work may lead to the development of more cost-effective wall materials with ca(2+) added as a prime factor.

TI  == probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses dmh-induced procarcinogenic fecal enzymes and preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci in early colon carcinogenesis in sprague dawley rats.
AB  == diet makes an important contribution to colorectal cancer (crc) risk implying risks for crc are potentially reducible. therefore, the probiotics have been suggested as the prophylactic measure in colon cancer. in this study, different probiotics were used to compare their protective potential against 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (dmh)-induced chemical colon carcinogenesis in  sprague dawley rats. animals belonging to different probiotic groups were fed orally with 1 x 10(9) lactobacilli daily for 1 week, and then a weekly injection  of dmh was given intraperitoneally for 6 wks with daily administration of probiotic. lactobacillus gg and l.acidophilus + dmh-treated animals had maximum percent reduction in acf counts. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in fecal nitroreductase activity was observed in l.casei + dmh and l.plantarum + dmh-treated rats whereas beta-glucuronidase activity decreased in l.gg + dmh and  l.acidophilus + dmh-treated rats. animals treated with bifidobacterium bifidum +  dmh had significant decreased beta-glucosidase activity. however, not much difference was observed in the colon morphology of animals belonging to various probiotic + dmh-treated rats compared with dmh-treated alone. the results indicated that probiotics, l.gg, and l.acidophilus can be used as the better prophylactic agents for experimental colon carcinogenesis.

TI  == probiotic-mediated competition, exclusion and displacement in biofilm formation by food-borne pathogens.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine the inhibitory effect of probiotic strains on pathogenic biofilm formation in terms of competition, exclusion and displacement. probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus kacc 12419, lact. casei kacc 12413, lact. paracasei kacc 12427 and lact. rhamnosus kacc 11953) and  pathogens (salmonella typhimurium kccm 40253 and listeria monocytogenes kacc 12671) were used to evaluate the auto-aggregation, hydrophobicity and biofilm formation inhibition. the highest auto-aggregation abilities were observed in lact. rhamnosus (17.5%), lact. casei (17.2%) and lact. acidophilus (15.1%). salm. typhimurium had the highest affinity to xylene, showing the hydrophobicity of 53.7%. the numbers of l. monocytogenes biofilm cells during the competition, exclusion and displacement assays were effectively reduced by more than 3 log when co-cultured with lact. paracasei and lact. rhamnosus. the results suggest that probiotic strains can be used as alternative way to effectively reduce the biofilm formation in pathogenic bacteria through competition, exclusion and displacement.

TI  == comparative genomic and functional analysis of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains marketed as probiotics.
AB  == four lactobacillus strains were isolated from marketed probiotic products, including l. rhamnosus strains from vifit (friesland campina) and idoform (ferrosan) and l. casei strains from actimel (danone) and yakult (yakult honsa co.). their genomes and phenotypes were characterized and compared in detail with l. casei strain bl23 and l. rhamnosus strain gg. phenotypic analysis of the new isolates indicated differences in carbohydrate utilization between l. casei and l. rhamnosus strains, which could be linked to their genotypes. the two isolated  l. rhamnosus strains had genomes that were virtually identical to that of l. rhamnosus gg, testifying to their genomic stability and integrity in food products. the l. casei strains showed much greater genomic heterogeneity. remarkably, all strains contained an intact spacba pilus gene cluster. however, only the l. rhamnosus strains produced mucus-binding spacba pili under the conditions tested. transcription initiation mapping demonstrated that the insertion of an iso-is30 element upstream of the pilus gene cluster in l. rhamnosus strains but absent in l. casei strains had constituted a functional promoter driving pilus gene expression. all l. rhamnosus strains triggered an nf-kappab response via toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) in a reporter cell line, whereas the l. casei strains did not or did so to a much lesser extent. this study demonstrates that the two l. rhamnosus strains isolated from probiotic products are virtually identical to l. rhamnosus gg and further highlights the differences between these and l. casei strains widely marketed as probiotics, in  terms of genome content, mucus-binding and metabolic capacities, and host signaling capabilities.

TI  == [gynophilus--a winning relay].
AB  == the vagina is a complex biocenosis where many micro-organisms coexist and colonize it. the dominant colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual is of the genus "lactobacillus". it is also called doderlein's bacillus and determines the  vaginal microbial balance through the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, bacteriocines and modify the competition of pathogens for adhesion to the vaginal epithelial cells. through these mechanisms the lactobacilli block the growth and development of other vaginal pathogenic microbial species and also inhibit the colonization of some other microorganisms  imported from outside. because of these potential therapeutic properties, the lactobacilli are used as effective medical agents for prophylaxys and therapy to  restore the physiological balance in the vaginal eco-system. according to our studies and gained clinical experience the etiological antibacterial treatment is not always sufficient to restore the normal vaginal flora. the complete recovery  of the vaginal flora could be reached using probiotics that are applied locally and per os. gynophilus is a new vaginal probiotic product containing one type of  the genus "lactobacillus": lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus. gynophilus restores the physiological balance of the vaginal flora and reduces the risk of recurrent  infection. the product is applied intravaginal and interacts locally, inhibits the growth of the most common vaginal pathogens: gardnerella vaginalis u candida  albicans.

AB  == the present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to  be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 lactobacillus plantarum, 37 lb. pentosus, 1 lb. paraplantarum, and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. lb. rhamnosus gg and lb. casei shirota were used as reference strains. the in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7), caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. three (3)  lb. pentosus, 4 lb. plantarum and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low ph. the majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 lb. plantarum and 7 lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. none of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. variable efficiency to adhere to caco-2 cells was observed. this was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. none of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. as a whole,  4 strains of lb. pentosus, 3 strains of lb. plantarum and 2 strains of lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains lb. casei shirota and lb. rhamnosus gg. these strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == new tween-80 microbiological assay of serum folate levels in humans and animals.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop a new tween-80 microbiological assay (tween-80 mba) to determine human or animal serum folate levels and to verify its reliability. the effects of the lactobacillius casei subspecies rhamnosus (l. casei, atcc no. 7469) inoculum concentration, incubation time, and tween-80 on l. casei growth were studied, and the serum folate levels were investigated. serum samples were collected from patients with esophageal cancer (ec) and healthy control subjects in yanting, healthy adult subjects in chengdu, sichuan, and in male sprague-dawley rats. optimal conditions for the new mba were as follows: 1.28 x 10(7) cfu/ml working inoculum, vitamin folic acid assay broth with 0.24% (w/w) tween-80, and anaerobic incubation with l. casei at 37 degrees c for 22 h.  under the optimal conditions, the working curve was in simple linear rather than  logarithmic equation; the linear working curve of the folic acid standard working solution concentration versus the turbidity (adsorption value) of medium with l.  casei ranged from 0.05 to 1.00 microg/l; the linear correlation coefficient was 0.9989 (sd 0.0007); the recovery rate of folate was 105.4-112.7%; and the minimum concentration for detecting folate was 0.03 microg/l. the rsd within-day and between-day precisions were 5.6 and 3.3%, respectively. the serum folate level of 100 ec patients was 6.4 (sem 0.4) microg/l which was significantly lower than that of healthy control subjects [8.0 (sem 0.6) microg/l, n = 100, p=0.020]. the  new tween-80 mba is considered to be a reliable method for measuring serum folate level.

TI  == characterization of the lactobacillus casei group based on the profiling of ribosomal proteins coded in s10-spc-alpha operons as observed by maldi-tof ms.
AB  == the taxonomy of the members of the lactobacillus casei group is complicated because of their phylogenetic similarity and controversial nomenclatural status.  in this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) of ribosomal proteins coded in the s10-spc-alpha operon, termed s10-germs, was applied in order to classify 33 sample strains belonging to the l. casei group. a total of 14 types of ribosomal protein genes coded in the operon were first sequenced from four type strains of the l. casei group (l. casei jcm 1134(t), l. paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 8130(t), l. paracasei subsp. tolerans jcm 1171(t), and l. rhamnosus jcm 1136(t)) together with l. casei jcm 11302, which is the former type strain of 'l. zeae'. the theoretical masses of the 14 types of ribosomal proteins used as biomarkers were  classified into five types and compiled into a ribosomal protein database. the observed ribosomal proteins of each strain, identified by maldi-tof ms, were categorized into types based on their masses, summarized as ribosomal protein profiles, and they were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. the 33 sample strains, together with seven genome-sequenced strains, could be classified into four major clusters, which coincided precisely with the taxa of the (sub)species  within the l. casei group. three "ancient" strains, identified as l. acidophilus  and l. casei, were correctly re-identified as l. paracasei subsp. paracasei by s10-germs. s10-germs would thus appear to be a powerful tool for phylogenetic characterization, with considerable potential for management of culture collections.

TI  == stable integration and expression of heterologous genes in several lactobacilli using an integration vector constructed from the integrase and attp sequences of  phage phiat3 isolated from lactobacillus casei atcc 393.
AB  == an integration vector capable of stably integrating and maintaining in the chromosomes of several lactobacilli over hundreds of generations has been constructed. the major integration machinery used is based on the phiat3 integrase (int) and attp sequences determined previously. a novel core sequence located at the 3' end of the trna(leu) gene is identified in lactobacillus fermentum atcc 14931 as the integration target by the integration vector though most of such sequences found in other lactobacilli are similar to that determined previously. due to the lack of an appropriate attb site in lactococcus lactis mg1363, the integration vector is found to be unable to integrate into the chromosome of the strain. however, such integration can be successfully restored  by cotransforming the integration vector with a replicative one harboring both attb and erythromycin resistance sequences into the strain. furthermore, the integration vector constructed carries a promoter region of plact from the chromosome of lactobacillus rhamnosus tcell-1 which is used to express green fluorescence and luminance protein genes in the lactobacilli studied.

TI  == functional analysis of the lactobacillus casei bl23 sortases.
AB  == sortases are a class of enzymes that anchor surface proteins to the cell wall of  gram-positive bacteria. lactobacillus casei bl23 harbors four sortase genes, two  belonging to class a (srta1 and srta2) and two belonging to class c (srtc1 and srtc2). class c sortases were clustered with genes encoding their putative substrates that were homologous to the spaefg and spacba proteins that encode mucus adhesive pili in lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. twenty-three genes encoding putative sortase substrates were identified in the l. casei bl23 genome with unknown (35%), enzymatic (30%), or adhesion-related (35%) functions. strains disrupted in srta1, srta2, srtc1, and srtc2 and an srta1 srta2 double mutant were constructed. the transcription of all four sortase encoding genes was detected, but only the mutation of srta1 resulted in a decrease in bacterial surface hydrophobicity. the beta-n-acetyl-glucosaminidase and cell wall proteinase activities of whole cells diminished in the srta1 mutant and, to a greater extent, in the srta1 srta2 double mutant. cell wall anchoring of the staphylococcal nuca reporter protein fused to a cell wall sorting sequence was also affected in the srta mutants, and the percentages of adhesion to caco-2 and  ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells were reduced for the srta1 srta2 strain. mutations in srtc1 or srtc2 result in an undetectable phenotype. together, these  results suggest that srta1 is the housekeeping sortase in l. casei bl23 and srta2 would carry out redundant or complementary functions that become evident when srta1 activity is absent.

TI  == fermentation of sugars and sugar alcohols by plaque lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objective: the objective was to analyse the ability of lactobacillus strains isolated from supragingival plaque of subjects with hyposalivation and from healthy controls to ferment sugars and sugar alcohols. material and methods: fifty strains isolated from interproximal plaque from subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (25 strains), subjects with primary sjogren's syndrome (16 strains) and from subjects with normal salivary secretion rate (9 strains) were tested. growth and ph were determined after 24 and 48 h of anaerobic incubation in vials containing basal media with 1 % of glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol or xylitol. results: no differences between strains isolated from hyposalivated subjects and controls were detected. all strains lowered the ph to <5.0 from fructose and the majority of the strains from glucose and sucrose. a ph of <5.5 was seen for 52 % of the strains using mannitol, 50 % using sorbitol and 36 % using xylitol. the ability to produce acids from sugars and sugar alcohols was highest among strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei and lowest among lactobacillus fermentum strains. conclusion: a large number of lactobacillus strains are able to ferment not only sugars but also the sugar substitutes mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol to ph levels critical for enamel demineralisation. clinical relevance: our findings suggest that products containing mannitol, sorbitol and/or xylitol may contribute to the acidogenic potential of the dental  plaque and especially in hyposalivated subjects with high numbers of lactobacilli.

AB  == probiotics have been shown to have a preventative role in colorectal carcinogenesis but research concerning their prophylactic potential in the later  stages of colorectal cancer, specifically metastasis is limited. this study explored the potential of cell-free supernatants (cfs) from 2 probiotic lactobacillus sp., lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, to inhibit colon cancer cell invasion by influencing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) activity and levels of the tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (zo-1) in cultured metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells. hct-116 cells were treated  with cfs from l. casei, l. rhamnosus, or bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (a gut commensal); or with uninoculated bacterial growth media. treatment with cfs from  both lactobacillus sp. decreased colorectal cell invasion but treatment with cfs  from b. thetaiotaomicron did not. cfs from both lactobacillus sp. decreased mmp-9 and increased zo-1 protein levels. l. rhamnosus cfs also lowered mmp-9 activity.  to begin elucidating the secreted bacterial factor conveying these responses, lactobacillus sp. cfs were fractionated into defined molecular weight ranges and  cell invasion assessed. fractionation revealed that the inhibitory activity was contained primarily in the >100 kda and 50-100 kda fractions, suggesting the inhibitory compound may be a macromolecule such as a protein, nucleic acid, or a  polysaccharide.

AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == inventory of non starter lactic acid bacteria from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese as assessed by a culture dependent multiphasic approach.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate microbial species diversity and strain complexity of the cultivable non starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) occurring in 31 ripened parmigiano reggiano (pr) cheeses. dereplication of 127 lactobacilli isolates by (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting yielded a total of 51 genotypes. phylogenetic relatedness of all the genotypes with known lactobacillus species was determined by a novel combined amplified 16s rdna restriction analysis (16s-ardra), species-specific pcr assays and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the species lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus paracasei comprise the largest portions of the cultivable nslab community in pr cheese, with an inter-individual diversity ranging from one to four dominant genotypes per sample. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus harbinensis and lactobacillus fermentum species were also detected at low frequency. the data showed differences in cultivable nslab population, with an overall decrease in diversity and complexity from early to advanced stages of ripening. finally the de-replicated collection of genotypes resulting from this work is the bases for further functional screening.

TI  == gut balance, a synbiotic supplement, increases fecal lactobacillus paracasei but  has little effect on immunity in healthy physically active individuals.
AB  == synbiotic supplements, which contain multiple functional ingredients, may enhance the immune system more than the use of individual ingredients alone. a double blind active controlled parallel trial over a 21 d exercise training period was conducted to evaluate the effect of gut balance, which contains lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (l. casei 431(r)), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis (bb-12(r)), lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5(r)), lactobacillus rhamnosus (lgg(r)), two prebiotics (raftiline and raftilose) and bovine whey derived lactoferrin and immunoglobulins with acacia gum on fecal microbiota, short chain  fatty acids (scfa), gut permeability, salivary lactoferrin and serum cytokines. all subjects randomized were included in the analysis. there was a 9-fold (1.2-fold to 64-fold; 95% confidence intervals p = 0.03) greater increase in fecal l. paracasei numbers with gut balance compared with acacia gum supplementation. gut balance was associated with a 50% (-12% to 72%; p = 0.02) smaller increase in the concentration of serum il-16 in comparison to acacia gum  from pre- to post-study. no substantial effects of either supplement were evident in fecal scfa concentrations, measures of mucosal immunity or gi permeability. clinical studies are now required to determine whether gut balance may exert beneficial gi health effects by increasing the recovery of fecal l. paracasei. both supplements had little effect on immunity. twenty two healthy physically active male subjects (mean age = 33.9 +/- 6.5y) were randomly allocated to either daily prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation for 21 d. saliva, blood, urine and fecal samples were collected pre-, mid and post-intervention. participants recorded patterns of physical activity on a self-reported questionnaire.

TI  == efficacy and safety profile of lcr35 complete freeze-dried culture in irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized, double-blind study.
AB  == aim: to assess the effects and safety of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus lcr35 complete freeze-dried culture (lcr35) in patients suffering from irritable bowel  syndrome (ibs). methods: a randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed in  50 patients complaining of ibs symptoms complying with rome iii criteria. patients were allocated to receive either lcr35 (n = 25) at a minimum daily dose  of 6 x 10(8) colony forming units or placebo (n = 25) for 4 wk. at inclusion, after treatment and 2 wk later, patients completed the ibs severity scale. change from baseline in the ibs severity score at the end of treatment was the primary efficacy criterion. changes were compared between groups in the whole population  and in ibs subtypes (ibs with predominance of constipation, ibs with predominance of diarrhoea, mixed ibs, unsubtyped ibs). the presence of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus in stools was investigated at inclusion and at the end of treatment. the gastrointestinal quality of life questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and depression (had) scale were also completed. results: both groups were balanced for baseline characteristics. in 85% of patients, stool analyses showed that lactobacillus casei rhamnosus able to survive in the digestive tract. in the whole population, improvements in the ibs severity score did not differ significantly between treatments with a 25% decrease after 4-wk treatment, and a  15% decrease from baseline 2 wk later in both groups. in ibs subgroups, statistical analysis could not be performed due to small sample size, but a clinical response in favour of lcr35 was observed in ibs patients with predominance of diarrhoea: no change in the symptom severity score was seen with  the placebo after 4 wk treatment, whereas a clinically relevant decrease occurred with lcr35 (-37% vs -3%). furthermore, in spite of an increase in symptom intensity, the ibs severity score was maintained below the baseline value 2 wk later with lcr35 (-19% from baseline), whilst a slight 5% increase from baseline  was observed with placebo. in the ibs subgroup with predominance of diarrhoea only, a clinically relevant decrease in abdominal pain severity score (-36%) was  observed with lcr35, whereas no change occurred with placebo. in mixed ibs patients, the 20% and 30% decreases in the ibs severity score observed after treatment with lcr35 and placebo, respectively, were maintained 2 wk later in both groups. a clinical response slightly in favour of placebo was observed at the end of the treatment period in ibs patients with predominance of constipation (-41% vs -20%) and unsubtyped ibs patients (-47% vs -17%), with the same value maintained 2 wk later. in both groups, no clinically relevant changes were observed either for the gastrointestinal quality of life index or had score. thus, these results suggest that sub-grouping of ibs patients may be important for optimizing treatment responses by the physician. conclusion: this pilot study suggests that lcr35 could have some efficacy in ibs patients complaining of diarrhoea. these preliminary results need to be confirmed in larger studies.

TI  == double-blind, randomised clinical assay to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preterm newborns weighing less than 1500 g in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  == background: a randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (nec) in newborns weighing <1500 g. methods: we studied a group of  150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacteruim infantis, streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of january 2007 through june 2010. clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. results: the primary outcome was the development of nec. both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or bifidobacteria growth. no differences were detected in terms of nec risk reduction (rr: 0.54, 95% ci 0.21 to 1.39) although  we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of nec frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. when the combined risk of nec or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (rr: 0.39, 95% ci 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. conclusions: probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of nec in preterm newborns.

TI  == modulation of toll-like receptor ligands and candida albicans-induced cytokine responses by specific probiotics.
AB  == probiotics have been proposed as modulators of gut inflammation, especially in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). in order to be able to use them in these clinical conditions, their capacity to modulate immune responses towards other stimuli or microorganisms has to be thoroughly understood. in the present study,  three different potentially probiotic strains, bifidobacterium breve (numres 204), lactobacillus rhamnosus (numres1) and lactobacillus casei (dn-114 001), have been studied for their potential to modulate responses to stimulation with pure pattern-recognition receptor (prr) ligands or to the gut commensal fungus candida albicans. cytokine production induced by prr ligands or c. albicans was assessed in conditions of simultaneous stimulation or preincubation of primary immune cells with bifidobacterium or lactobacillus spp. results indicate that simultaneous stimulation leads to potentiation of il-1beta and il-6 production, while the tnfalpha and ifn-gamma production was inhibited. in settings of pre-incubation with these potentially probiotic strains, lower production of tnfalpha was observed in the presence of b. breve. moreover, c. albicans-induced  il-17 production was decreased after pre-incubation with both bifidobacterium or  lactobacillus probiotic strains. whereas c. albicans induced cytokines are dampened by the tested probiotic strains, tnfalpha and il-6 production by pure pattern-recognition receptor ligands are potentiated. interestingly, an important role of toll-like receptor 9 signalling that involves jnk kinase in the modulatory effects of these probiotic strains has been identified. in conclusion, specific probiotic strains exhibit cross-tolerance effects towards other inflammatory stimuli, especially c. albicans, which might have beneficial effects on gut inflammation.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  == strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included lactobacillus casei/lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus and pediococcus acidilactici. the susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in escherichia coli for comparison. analysis of l. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. e. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and  florfenicol. no extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.

TI  == analysis of the peptidoglycan hydrolase complement of lactobacillus casei and characterization of the major gamma-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-endopeptidase.
AB  == peptidoglycan (pg) is the major component of gram positive bacteria cell wall and is essential for bacterial integrity and shape. bacteria synthesize pg hydrolases (pghs) which are able to cleave bonds in their own pg and play major roles in pg  remodelling required for bacterial growth and division. our aim was to identify the main pghs in lactobacillus casei bl23, a lactic acid bacterium with probiotic properties.the pgh complement was first identified in silico by amino acid sequence similarity searches of the bl23 genome sequence. thirteen pghs were detected with different predicted hydrolytic specificities. transcription of the  genes was confirmed by rt-pcr. a proteomic analysis combining the use of sds-page and lc-ms/ms revealed the main seven pghs synthesized during growth of l. casei bl23. among these pghs, lcabl_02770 (renamed lc-p75) was identified as the major  one. this protein is the homolog of p75 (msp1) major secreted protein of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, which was shown to promote survival and growth of intestinal epithelial cells. we identified its hydrolytic specificity on pg and showed that it is a gamma-d-glutamyl-l-lysyl-endopeptidase. it has a marked specificity towards pg tetrapeptide chains versus tripeptide chains and for oligomers rather than monomers. immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated that  lc-p75 localizes at cell septa in agreement with its role in daughter cell separation. it is also secreted under an active form as detected in zymogram. comparison of the muropeptide profiles of wild type and lc-p75-negative mutant revealed a decrease of the amount of disaccharide-dipeptide in the mutant pg in agreement with lc-p75 activity. as a conclusion, lc-p75 is the major l. casei bl23 pgh with endopeptidase specificity and a key role in daughter cell separation. further studies will aim at investigating the role of lc-p75 in the anti-inflammatory potential of l. casei bl23.

TI  == effect of water activity and protective solutes on growth and subsequent survival to air-drying of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium cultures.
AB  == probiotic cultures of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus were grown in media having water activities (a (w)) adjusted between 0.99 and 0.94 with nacl or with a mixture of glycerol and sucrose in order to find conditions of osmotic stress which would still allow for good growth. cultures grown at a (w) = 0.96 or 0.99 were then recovered by centrifugation, added to a sucrose-phosphate medium and air-dried. in some assays, a 2-h osmotic stress was  applied to the cell concentrate prior to air-drying. assays were also carried out where betaine, glutamate and proline (bgp) supplements were added as protective compounds to the growth or drying media. for most strains, evidence of osmotic stress and benefits of bgp supplementation on growth occurred at a (w) = 0.96. growing the cells in complex media adjusted at a (w) = 0.96 did not enhance their subsequent survival to air-drying, but applying the 2-h osmotic stress did. addition of the bgp supplements to the growth medium or in the 2-h stress medium  did not enhance survival to air-drying. furthermore, addition of bgp to a sucrose-phosphate drying medium reduced survival of the cultures to air-drying. this study provides preliminary data for producers of probiotics who wish to use  air-drying in replacement of freeze-drying for the stabilization of cultures.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == the major secreted protein msp1/p75 is o-glycosylated in lactobacillus rhamnosus  gg.
AB  == background: although the occurrence, biosynthesis and possible functions of glycoproteins are increasingly documented for pathogens, glycoproteins are not yet widely described in probiotic bacteria. nevertheless, knowledge of protein glycosylation holds important potential for better understanding specific glycan-mediated interactions of probiotics and for glycoengineering in food-grade microbes. results: here, we provide evidence that the major secreted protein msp1/p75 of the probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg is glycosylated. msp1 was shown to stain positive with periodic-acid schiff staining, to be susceptible to  chemical deglycosylation, and to bind with the mannose-specific concanavalin a (cona) lectin. recombinant expression in escherichia coli resulted in a significant reduction in molecular mass, loss of cona reactivity and increased sensitivity towards pronase e and proteinase k. mass spectrometry showed that msp1 is o-glycosylated and identified a glycopeptide tvetpssa (amino acids 101-108) bearing hexoses presumably linked to the serine residues. interestingly, these serine residues are not present in the homologous protein of several lactobacillus casei strains tested, which also did not bind to cona. the role of  the glycan substitutions in known functions of msp1 was also investigated. glycosylation did not seem to impact significantly on the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of msp1. in addition, the glycan chain appeared not to be required for the activation of akt signaling in intestinal epithelial cells by msp1. on the other hand, examination of different cell extracts showed that msp1 is a glycosylated protein in the supernatant, but not in the cell wall and cytosol fraction, suggesting a link between glycosylation and secretion of this protein.  conclusions: in this study we have provided the first evidence of protein o-glycosylation in the probiotic l rhamnosus gg. the major secreted protein msp1  is glycosylated with cona reactive sugars at the serine residues at 106 and 107.  glycosylation is not required for the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of msp1 nor for akt activation capacity in epithelial cells, but appears to be important  for its stability and protection against proteases.

TI  == manufacture of fior di latte cheese by incorporation of probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == this work aimed to select heat-resistant probiotic lactobacilli to be added to fior di latte (high-moisture cow milk mozzarella) cheese. first, 18 probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus reuteri were screened. resistance to heating (65 or  55 degrees c for 10 min) varied markedly between strains. adaptation at 42 degrees c for 10 min increased the heat resistance at 55 degrees c for 10 min of  all probiotic lactobacilli. heat-adapted l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 227.4 min) and l. paracasei bgp1 (decimal reduction time at 55 degrees c of 40.8 min) showed the highest survival  under heat conditions that mimicked the stretching of the curd and were used for  the manufacture of fior di latte cheese. two technology options were chosen: chemical (addition of lactic acid to milk) or biological (streptococcus thermophilus as starter culture) acidification with or without addition of probiotics. as determined by random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr and 16s rrna gene analyses, the cell density of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 in chemically or biologically acidified fior di latte cheese was approximately 8.0 log(10)cfu/g. microbiological, compositional, biochemical, and  sensory analyses (panel test by 30 untrained judges) showed that the use of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus sp5 and l. paracasei bgp1 enhanced flavor formation and shelf-life of fior di latte cheeses.

TI  == comparative effects of six probiotic strains on immune function in vitro.
AB  == there is considerable interest in the strain specificity of immune modulation by  probiotics. the present study compared the immunomodulatory properties of six probiotic strains of different species and two genera in a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) model in vitro. live cells of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei shirota, l. rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum ncimb 8826 and l. reuteri ncimb 11951) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum sp 07/3 and b. bifidum mf 20/5) were individually incubated with pbmc from seven healthy subjects for 24 h. probiotic strains increased the proportion of cd69+ on lymphocytes, t cells, t cell subsets and natural killer (nk) cells, and increased the proportion of cd25+, mainly on lymphocytes and nk cells. the effects on activation marker expression did not appear to be strain specific. nk cell activity was significantly increased by all six strains, without any significant difference between strains. probiotic strains increased production of il-1beta, il-6, il-10, tnf-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha to different extents, but had no effect on the production of il-2, il-4, il-5 or tnf-beta. the cytokines that showed strain-specific modulation included il-10, interferon-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-12p70, il-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. the lactobacillus strains tended to promote t helper 1 cytokines, whereas bifidobacterial strains tended to produce a more anti-inflammatory profile. the results suggest that there was limited evidence of strain-specific effects of probiotics with respect to t cell and nk cell activation or nk cell activity, whereas production of some cytokines was differentially influenced by probiotic strains.

AB  == three strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the faeces of apparently healthy wild canada geese (branta canadensis) in 2010 by cultivating faecal lab on rogosa sl agar under aerobic conditions. these three isolates were  found to share 99.9 % gene sequence similarity of their 16s rrna, their 16s-23s intergenic transcribed spacer region (its), partial 23s rrna, rpob, rpoc, rpoa and phes gene sequences. however, the three strains exhibited lower levels of sequence similarity of these genetic targets to all known lab, and the phylogenetically closest species to the geese strains were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus saniviri. in comparison to l. casei atcc 393(t), l. paracasei atcc 25302(t), l. rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and l. saniviri dsm 24301(t), the novel isolates reacted uniquely in tests for cellobiose, galactose, mannitol, citric acid, aesculin and dextrin, and gave negative results in tests for l-proline arylamidase and l-pyrrolydonyl-arylamidase, and in the voges-proskauer test. biochemical tests for cellobiose, aesculin, galactose, gentiobiose, mannitol, melezitose, ribose, salicin, sucrose, trehalose, raffinose, turanose, amygdalin and arbutin could be  used for differentiation between l. saniviri and the novel strains. on the basis  of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, and phylogenetic data, the three isolates represent a novel species of the genus lactobacillus, for which the name lactobacillus brantae sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is sl1108(t) (= atcc  baa-2142(t) = lmg 26001(t) = dsm 23927(t)) and two additional strains are sl1170  and sl60106.

TI  == probiotics for prevention and treatment of diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

AB  == the present work was aimed at characterizing 12 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) to obtain improved potential starter or probiotic cultures that could be used for making dairy products from ewe's milk and cow's milk. eight strains with antimicrobial properties, isolated from ewe's milk and from cheese made from ewe's and/or cow's milk, were studied. they were identified as enterococcus faecalis (five strains), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (one strain of each species). additionally, four strains were obtained from the american type culture collection: lactobacillus casei 393 (isolated from cheese), l. lactis subsp. lactis 11454 (origin nonspecified and a producer of nisin), and two strains isolated from human feces (l. paracasei subsp. paracasei 27092 and lactobacillus  rhamnosus 53103, antibacterial agent producer). all e. faecalis strains showed at least one virulence factor (either hemolysin or gelatinase), which emphasizes the importance of these studies in this species. both l. lactis strains and most lactobacillus spp. were good acidifiers in ewe's milk and cow's milk at 30 degrees c. high beta-galactosidase activity, as well as aminopeptidase activities that favor the development of desirable flavors in cheese, were detected in all lactobacillus spp. strains. furthermore, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 showed alpha-fucosidase activity (thought to help colonization of the intestine) and lack of alpha-glucosidase activity (a trait considered positive for diabetic and  obese humans). this last enzymatic activity was also lacking in l. lactis atcc 11454. l. mesenteroides was the only strain d(2)-lactic acid producer. the selection of any particular strain for probiotic or dairy cultures should be performed according to the technological and/or functional abilities needed.

TI  == anticarcinogenic effect of probiotic fermented milk and chlorophyllin on aflatoxin-b(1)-induced liver carcinogenesis in rats.
AB  == the present investigation was carried out to evaluate the hepatoprotective effect of probiotic fermented milk (fm) containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei strain shirota, alone as well as in combination with chlorophyllin (chl) as an antioxidant agent in male wistar rats administered aflatoxin-b(1) (afb(1)). afb(1) was injected intraperitoneally at the rate of 450 mug/kg body weight per animal twice a week for 6 weeks, maintaining an equal time interval between the two consecutive afb(1) administrations. a total of 125 male  wistar rats were randomly allocated to five groups, each group having twenty-five animals. group i was offered fm containing l. rhamnosus gg and l. casei strain shirota. group ii was administered afb1 and served as the control group; group iii was administered fm-afb(1), in which besides administering afb(1), fm was also offered. group iv was offered chl and afb(1), and group v was offered both fm and chl along with afb(1). the rats were euthanised at the 15th and 25th week  of the experiment and examined for the biochemical and hepatopathological profile. a significant reduction in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (tbars) was observed in the fm-chl-afb(1) group compared with the afb1 control group. fm alone or in combination with chl was found to show a significant (p < 0.05) hepatoprotective effect by lowering the levels of tbars and by enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide  dismutase, catalase and glutathione-s-transferase, indicating that probiotic fm alone or in combination with chl possesses a potent protective effect against afb(1)-induced hepatic damage.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg as an effective probiotic for murine giardiasis.
AB  == the gut microflora is an important constituent in the intestinal mucosal barrier  and has been introduced as the concept of probiotic therapy that beneficially affects the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance. therefore, the main objective of the study was to explore the protective potential of various lactobacilli strains for murine giardiasis. by experimentation, it was found that the probiotic supplementation of either lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, or l. rhamnosus gg, 7 days prior to inoculation with g. lamblia trophozoites, reduced the rate of cyst excretion compared with giardia-infected mice. interestingly, l. gg was found to be the most effective probiotic in reducing the duration of giardia cycle and acts as an effective prophylactic probiotic for murine giardiasis but needs to be clinically correlated due to entirely different human microflora.

TI  == modulation of th1/th2 balance by lactobacillus strains isolated from kimchi via stimulation of macrophage cell line j774a.1 in vitro.
AB  == lactobacilli isolated from kimchi, a korean traditional food, were tested for their capacity to modulate the t helper (th) 1/th2 balance. ovalbumin (ova)-sensitized mouse splenocytes were cultured with 26 strains of lactobacilli; the highest il-12 induction and lowest il-4 production were then observed in 4 strains, including lactobacillus plantarum cjlp55, cjlp56, cjlp133, and cjlp136.  these strains produced a larger amount of il-12, which enhances differentiation and activation of th1 cells, in macrophage cell-lines more than positive control  strains l. casei kctc 3109(t) and l. rhamnosus gg, although they also induced production of il-10, which is a suppressor of il-12. indeed, cjlp133-stimulated macrophages induced production of more th1 cytokine ifn-gamma and less th2 cytokine il-4 than kctc 3109(t) and gg in co-cultivation with t cells. these findings suggest that lactobacilli from kimchi may modulate the th1/th2 balance via macrophage activation in the hypersensitive reaction caused by th2 cells. practical application: allergic reactions including asthma and atopy are caused by predominance of th2 response over th1 response. lactobacilli isolated from fermented foods such as yogurt, cheese, and kimchi showed health-promoting activities. the present study indicated that several lactobacilli strains from kimchi may reduce allergic reactions through macrophage-mediated induction of th1 response.

AB  == two gram-stain-positive strains, yit 12363(t) and yit 12364(t), were isolated from human faeces. they were rod-shaped, non-motile, asporogenous, facultatively  anaerobic and did not exhibit catalase activity. comparative analyses of 16s rrna, phes and rpoa gene sequences demonstrated that the novel strains were members of the genus lactobacillus. on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarity, the type strains of lactobacillus casei (95.3% similarity), lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (95.6%), lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  tolerans (95.3%) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (95.4%) were the closest neighbours  to strain yit 12363(t). for strain yit 12364(t), the highest similarity values were observed with the type strains of lactobacillus diolivorans, lactobacillus parafarraginis and lactobacillus rapi (95.8, 96.0 and 96.0%, respectively). phenotypic and genotypic features demonstrated that these strains each represent  a separate novel species of the genus lactobacillus, and the names lactobacillus  saniviri sp. nov. (type strain yit 12363(t)=jcm 17471(t)=dsm 24301(t)) and lactobacillus senioris sp. nov. (type strain yit 12364(t)=jcm 17472(t)=dsm 24302(t)), respectively, are proposed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity against shigella sonnei and probiotic properties of wild lactobacilli from fermented food.
AB  == four lactobacilli strains (lactobacillus paracasei subp. paracasei m5-l, lactobacillus rhamnosus j10-l, lactobacillus casei q8-l and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg), were systematically assessed for the production of antimicrobial substances active towards shigella sonnei, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. agar-well assay showed that the four lactobacilli strains displayed  strong antibacterial activity towards s. sonnei. the nature of antimicrobial substances was also investigated and shown to be dependent on the production of organic acids, in particular the lactic acid. time-kill assay showed that the viability of the s. sonnei was decreased by 2.7-3.6logcfu/ml after contact with cfcs (cell-free culture supernatants) of four lactobacilli for 2h, which confirmed the result of the agar-well assay. further analysis of the organic acid composition in the cfcs revealed that the content of lactic acid range from 227 to 293mm. in addition, the aggregations properties, adherence properties and tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal conditions were also investigated in vitro tests. the result suggested that the m5-l, j10-l and q8-l strains possess desirable antimicrobial activity towards s. sonnei and probiotic properties as lgg and could be potentially used as novel probiotic strains in the food industry.

TI  == shotgun phage display of lactobacillus casei bl23 against collagen and fibronectin.
AB  == lactobacilli are normal constituents of the intestinal microbiota, and some strains show the capacity to bind to extracellular matrix proteins and components of the mucosal layer, which represents an adaptation to persist in this niche. a  shotgun phage-display library of lactobacillus casei bl23 was constructed and screened for peptides able to bind to fibronectin and collagen. clones showing binding to these proteins were isolated, which encoded overlapping fragments of a putative transcriptional regulator (lcabl_29260), a hypothetical protein exclusively found in the l. casei/rhamnosus group (lcabl_01820), and a putative phage-related endolysin (lcabl_13470). the construction of different glutathione  s-transferase (gst) fusions confirmed the binding activity and demonstrated that  the three identified proteins could interact with fibronectin, fibrinogen, and collagen. the results illustrate the utility of phage display for the isolation of putative adhesins in lactobacilli. however, it remains to be determined whether the primary function of these proteins actually is adhesion to mucosal surfaces.

TI  == probiotic manipulation of the gastrointestinal microbiota.
AB  == in a recent publication we examined whether high abundance of a probiotic species, lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus gg (lgg), impacted the overall composition of the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiota of six-month-old infants at high risk for asthma development. profound gi microbiota restructuring and the establishment of significantly more even and putatively, functionally redundant consortia were characteristic of high lgg abundance. here we discuss, in the context of more recently published data, support for the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of probiotic supplementation on human health lies in the formation of a stable and resilient gut ecosystem enriched for species that exert a concerted beneficial effect on the host immune system via direct and indirect mechanisms.

TI  == differential toll-like receptor recognition and induction of cytokine profile by  bifidobacterium breve and lactobacillus strains of probiotics.
AB  == the use of probiotics as a food supplement has gained tremendous interest in the  last few years as beneficial effects were reported in gut homeostasis and nutrient absorption but also in immunocompromised patients, supporting protection from colonization or infection with pathogenic bacteria or fungi. as a treatment  approach for inflammatory bowel diseases, a suitable probiotic strain would ideally be one with a low immunogenic potential. insight into the immunogenicities and types of t-cell responses induced by potentially probiotic strains allows a more rational selection of a particular strain. in the present study, the bacterial strains bifidobacterium breve (numres 204), lactobacillus rhamnosus (numres1), and lactobacillus casei (dn-114 001) were compared concerning their capacity to induce inflammatory responses in terms of cytokine production by human and mouse primary immune cells. it was demonstrated that the  b. breve strain induced lower levels of the proinflammatory cytokine gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) than the tested l. rhamnosus and l. casei strains. both b. breve and lactobacilli induced cytokines in a toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9)-dependent manner, while the lower inflammatory profile of b. breve was due to inhibitory effects of tlr2. no role for tlr4, nod2, and c-type lectin receptors was apparent. in conclusion, tlr signaling is involved in the differentiation of inflammatory responses between probiotic strains used as food  supplements.

TI  == microbiological profiles in saliva and supragingival plaque from caries-active adolescents before and after a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with  probiotic bacteria - a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the microbial profile in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents before and after a daily short-term intake of milk supplemented with  the probiotic bacteria. materials and methods: the present study group consisted  of 18 caries-active adolescents of both sexes who volunteered for participation giving an informed consent. the study has a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind pilot design with two parallel arms. after a 2-week run-in period, the subjects were instructed to drink 2.5 dl of milk supplemented with lactobacillus rhamnosus lb21 (107 cfu/ml) (test) or standard control milk (placebo) once daily for a period of 2 weeks (intervention period). samples of stimulated whole saliva and supragingival plaque were collected at baseline (after run-in) and immediately after the end of the intervention period (follow-up). the salivary levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional culturing on selective agar plates. the presence and level of 19 oral species associated with the caries process were determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridisation technique. differences between the groups  were assessed using the non-parametric wilcoxon-mann-whitney and chi-square tests. results: the mean caries experience was high with an average of 7.0 +/- 3.8 proximal enamel lesions. the most prevalent dominating species in the plaque  samples were streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula and streptococcus gordonii. the saliva samples displayed a more mixed profile, with streptococcus mitis, rothia dentocariosa, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus curvata being frequently identified species. all of the subjects harboured mutans streptococci  in their saliva, with 61% of them colonised with salivary lactobacilli. no statistically significant differences in the microbial profiles or the estimated  counts between the baseline and follow-up samples, or between the two study groups, were observed. conclusions: the present study showed that a short-term daily intake of milk supplemented with the probiotic bacterium l. rhamnosus lb21  did not significantly affect the microbial profiles or the levels of caries-associated bacteria in saliva and supragingival plaque samples collected from caries-active adolescents.

TI  == functional analysis of the p40 and p75 proteins from lactobacillus casei bl23.
AB  == the genomes of lactobacillus casei/paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains  carry two genes encoding homologues of p40 and p75 from l. rhamnosus gg, two secreted proteins which display anti-apoptotic and cell protective effects on human intestinal epithelial cells. p40 and p75 carry cysteine, histidine-dependent aminohydrolase/peptidase (chap) and nlpc/p60 domains, respectively, which are characteristic of proteins with cell-wall hydrolase activity. in l. casei bl23 both proteins were secreted to the growth medium and were also located at the bacterial cell surface. the genes coding for both proteins were inactivated in this strain. inactivation of lcabl_00230 (encoding p40) did not result in a significant difference in phenotype, whereas a mutation  in lcabl_02770 (encoding p75) produced cells that formed very long chains. purified glutathione-s-transferase (gst)-p40 and -p75 fusion proteins were able to hydrolyze the muropeptides from l. casei cell walls. both fusions bound to mucin, collagen and to intestinal epithelial cells and, similar to l. rhamnosus gg p40, stimulated epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation in mouse intestine ex vivo. these results indicate that extracellular proteins belonging to the machinery of cell-wall metabolism in the closely related l. casei/paracasei-l. rhamnosus group are most likely involved in the probiotic effects described for these bacteria.

TI  == widely distributed lysogeny in probiotic lactobacilli represents a potentially high risk for the fermentative dairy industry.
AB  == prophages account for most of the genetic diversity among strains of a given bacterial species, and represent a latent source for the generation of virulent phages. in this work, a set of 30 commercial, collection and dairy-isolated lactobacillus casei group strains were used. a species-specific pcr assay allowed a reclassification, mainly of strains previously considered lactobacillus casei,  into either lactobacillus paracasei or lactobacillus rhamnosus. all the strains were induced with mitomycin c, allowing direct recovering of phage dna in 25 cases, which corroborates the widely occurrence of lysogeny on lactobacillus genomes, including probiotic strains of lactobacillus casei group. ten out of 11  commercial strains studied contained prophages, evidencing the potential risks of their use at industrial scale. strains were also induced by treatment with different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide but, however, this agent was not able to evidence a prophage release for any of the strains tested. according to a rapd-pcr fingerprinting with m13, 1254 and g1 primers, most of the commercial strains presented a high degree of homology and, regarding bglii- and bamhi-restriction profiles of phage dna, six of them harboured the same prophage. surprisingly, both lactobacillus paracasei atcc 27092 and lactobacillus paracasei atcc 27139 shared a second prophage with both an inlain collection and a commercial lactobacillus paracasei strains, whereas two collection strains shared a third one. on the other hand, mitomycin c-inducible prophages were detected only on about a half of the strains isolated from dairy products, which had (with only one exception) from moderate to high correlation coefficients according to rapd-pcr fingerprinting. after induction, supernatants were filtered and tested against nine lactobacillus strains of the set sensitive to previously assayed virulent phages, allowing isolation of two new virulent phages: small ef, cyrillic ilp1308 and small ef, cyrillic ilp84. both phages were able to lyse all  but one strains sensitive to previously assayed phage mlc-a.

TI  == protective effect of lactobacillus casei strain shirota against lethal infection  with multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in mice.
AB  == aims: the anti-infectious activity of lactobacilli against multi-drug resistant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 (dt104) was examined in a murine model of an opportunistic antibiotic-induced infection. methods and results: explosive intestinal growth and subsequent lethal extra-intestinal translocation  after oral infection with dt104 during fosfomycin (fom) administration was significantly inhibited by continuous oral administration of lactobacillus casei  strain shirota (lcs), which is naturally resistant to fom, at a dose of 10(8) colony-forming units per mouse daily to mice. comparison of the anti-salmonella activity of several lactobacillus type strains with natural resistance to fom revealed that lactobacillus brevis atcc 14869(t) , lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t) , lactobacillus reuteri jcm 1112(t) , lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469(t) and lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741(t) conferred no activity even when they obtained the high population levels almost similar to those of the effective strains such as lcs, lact. casei atcc 334(t) and lactobacillus zeae atcc 15820(t) . the increase in concentration of organic acids and maintenance of the lower ph in the intestine because of lactobacillus colonization were correlated with the anti-infectious activity. moreover, heat-killed lcs was not protective against the infection, suggesting that the metabolic activity of lactobacilli is important for the anti-infectious activity. conclusion: these results suggest that certain lactobacilli in combination with antibiotics may be  useful for prophylaxis against opportunistic intestinal infections by multi-drug  resistant pathogens, such as dt104. significance and impact of the study: antibiotics such as fom disrupt the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota that produce organic acids, and that only probiotic strains that are metabolically active in vivo should be selected to prevent intestinal infection when used clinically in combination with certain antibiotics.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

AB  == diminished exposure to harmless micro-organisms, such as lactobacilli, has been suggested to play a role in the increased prevalence of allergic disorders in westernized communities. the development of allergies depends on both environmental factors and genetic variations, including polymorphisms in genes encoding pattern recognition receptors. the present study examines the effects of both colonization with specific lactobacillus species and genetic variations in dc-sign, a pattern recognition receptor on dendritic cells that recognizes lactobacilli, on the development of atopic dermatitis (ad) and sensitization in infancy. within the koala birth cohort study, faecal samples of 681 one-month-old infants were collected and quantitatively screened for five lactobacillus species: l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri. eleven haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in the dc-sign gene were genotyped in these children. allergic outcomes were a clinical diagnosis of ad and sensitization (specific ige) at age 2 years. l. rhamnosus (31.5 %), l. paracasei  (31.3 %) and l. acidophilus (14.4 %) were frequently detected in the faecal samples of one-month-old infants, whereas l. casei (2.5 %) and l. reuteri (<1 %)  were rare. colonization with l. paracasei decreased the risk of ad significantly  (odds ratio 0.57, 95 % confidence interval 0.32-0.99), whereas effects of l. acidophilus were of borderline statistical significance (0.46, 0.20-1.04). two dc-sign polymorphisms, rs11465413 and rs8112555, were statistically significantly associated with atopic sensitization. the present study supports the 'old friends' hypothesis suggesting that certain health-beneficial micro-organisms protect us from developing allergies and that these protective effects are species-dependent. firm conclusions on the potential interaction between lactobacillus colonization and genetic variations in dc-sign in association with  the development of allergic disorders cannot be drawn, given the limited power of our study. therefore, incorporation of consecutive faecal sampling in newly started (birth) cohort studies would be a first requisite to further increase our understanding of host-microbial interactions in health and disease.

TI  == human mucosal in vivo transcriptome responses to three lactobacilli indicate how  probiotics may modulate human cellular pathways.
AB  == probiotic bacteria, specific representatives of bacterial species that are a common part of the human microbiota, are proposed to deliver health benefits to the consumer by modulation of intestinal function through largely unknown molecular mechanisms. to explore in vivo mucosal responses of healthy adults to probiotics, we obtained transcriptomes in an intervention study after a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. in the mucosa of the proximal  small intestine of healthy volunteers, probiotic strains from the species lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, and l. rhamnosus each induced differential gene-regulatory networks and pathways in the human mucosa. comprehensive analyses revealed that these transcriptional networks regulate major basal mucosal processes and uncovered remarkable similarity to response profiles obtained for specific bioactive molecules and drugs. this study elucidates how intestinal mucosa of healthy humans perceives different probiotics and provides avenues for  rationally designed tests of clinical applications.

TI  == the dnak gene as a molecular marker for the classification and discrimination of  the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == it is hard to accurately identify specific species of the lactobacillus casei group using phenotypic techniques alone. some strains of this species group are considered to be probiotic and are widely applied in the food industry. in this study, we compared the use of two phylogenetic markers, the 16s rrna and dnak genes, for species discrimination of the members of the l. casei group using sequencing and rflp. the results showed that l. casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus zeae and lactobacillus rhamnosus could be clearly distinguished based on the dnak gene. the average sequence similarity for the dnak gene (87.8%) among type strains was significantly less than that of the 16s rrna sequence (99.1%). therefore, the dnak gene can be proposed as an additional molecular phylogenetic marker for l. casei that provides higher resolution than 16s rrna. species-specific rflp profiles of the lactobacillus strains were obtained with the enzyme apoi. our data indicate that the phylogenetic relationships between these strains are easily resolved using sequencing of the dnak gene or rflp assays.

TI  == inhibition of shigella sonnei adherence to ht-29 cells by lactobacilli from chinese fermented food and preliminary characterization of s-layer protein involvement.
AB  == in this study, seven lactobacilli with a high degree of antagonistic activity against three pathogens and good adherence to ht-29 cells were selected. the ability of these seven lactobacilli to inhibit adhesion of shigella sonnei to intestinal mucosa was studied on cultured ht-29 cells. lactobacilli were added simultaneously with, before or after s. sonnei to test for their effectiveness in exclusion, competition and displacement assays, respectively. lactobacillus paracasei subp. paracasei m5-l, lactobacillus rhamnosus j10-l and lactobacillus casei q8-l all exhibited significant inhibitory activity. in order to elucidate the inhibitory functions of s-layer proteins, the s-layer proteins were removed with 5 m licl from the m5-l, j10-l and q8-l strains. under such conditions, inhibition activity was decreased in all three strains, as revealed in exclusion, competition and displacement assays. sds-page analysis confirmed the presence of  s-layer proteins with dominant bands of approximately 45 kda. further analysis of s-layer proteins revealed that the hydrophobic amino acids accounted for 40.5%, 41.5% and 43.8% of the total amino acid for the m5-l, j10-l and q8-l strains, respectively. these findings suggest that the m5-l, j10-l and q8-l strains possess the ability to inhibit s. sonnei adherence to ht-29 cells, and s-layer proteins are involved in this adhesion inhibition.

TI  == the effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus on the prevention of asthma in a murine model.
AB  == purpose: lactobacilli are probiotic bacteria that are effective in the management of allergic diseases or gastroenteritis. it is hypothesized that such probiotics  have immunoregulatory properties and promote mucosal tolerance. our goal was to investigate whether lactobacillus casei rhamnosus lcr35 could inhibit airway inflammation in an ovalbumin (ova)-induced murine model of asthma. methods: balb/c mice aged 6 weeks were used in the present study. lactobacillus casei rhamnosus lcr35 was administered daily, starting 1 week prior to the first ova sensitization (group 1) and 2 days before the first 1% ova airway challenge (group 2). mice that received only saline at both sensitization and airway challenge time points were used as negative controls (group 3), and those that had ova-induced asthma were used as positive controls (group 4). airway responsiveness to methacholine was assessed, and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) was performed. at the endpoint of the study, total ige as well as ova-specific ige, igg(1) and igg(2a) in serum was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. lung pathology was also evaluated. results: airway hyperresponsiveness, total cell counts and the proportion of eosinophils in bal fluid were significantly decreased in group 1 compared with group 4 (p<0.05). total serum ige levels were  also significantly decreased in group 1 compared with group 4. serum levels of ova-specific ige, igg(1) and igg(2a) were not significantly influenced by treatment with lcr35. there was significantly less peribronchial and perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells in group 1 compared with group 4; however, there were no significant differences in methacholine challenge, bal, serology or histology between groups 2 and 4. conclusions: oral treatment with lcr35 prior to sensitization can attenuate airway inflammation and hyperreactivity in a mouse model of allergic airway inflammation. these results suggest that lcr35 may have  potential for preventing asthma.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria colonization and clinical outcome after probiotic supplementation in conventionally treated bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
AB  == this randomized double-blind placebo controlled study assessed the vaginal colonization of lactic acid bacteria and clinical outcome. vaginal capsules containing l gasseri ln40, lactobacillus fermentum ln99, l. casei subsp. rhamnosus ln113 and p. acidilactici ln23, or placebos were administered for five  days to 95 women after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis. vulvovaginal examinations and vaginal samplings were performed before and after administration, after the first and second menstruation, and after six months. presence of ln strains was assessed using rapd analysis. ln strains were present 2-3 days after administration in 89% of the women receiving ln strains (placebo: 0%, p < 0.0001). after one menstruation  53% were colonized by at least one ln strain. nine percent were still colonized six months after administration. ninety-three percent of the women receiving ln strains were cured 2-3 days after administration (placebo: 83%), and 78% after one menstruation (placebo: 71%) (ns). the intervention group experienced less malodorous discharge 2-3 days after administration (p = 0.03) and after the second menstruation (p = 0.04), compared with placebo. in summary, five days of vaginal administration of ln strains after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis lead to vaginal colonization, somewhat  fewer recurrences and less malodorous discharge.

TI  == m-rtlv agar, a novel selective medium to distinguish lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei from lactobacillus rhamnosus.
AB  == we developed a novel selective medium, modified-rhamnose-2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride-lbs-vancomycin agar (m-rtlv agar), that utilizes the fermentability of l-rhamnose to distinguish lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei from lactobacillus rhamnosus. whereas l. casei and l. paracasei formed red colonies on the m-rtlv agar, l. rhamnosus formed either pink-toned colonies or white colonies with a red spot. an intervention study was conducted to confirm the capability of m-rtlv agar to detect ingested l. casei when recovered from human feces. subjects consumed one bottle daily of a fermented milk product (yakult or yakult light, which contains  l. casei strain shirota; lcs) for 7 days. diluents of the fecal samples were cultivated on m-rtlv agar. we were able to enumerate circular medium-sized red colonies, which were morphologically similar to l. casei/l. paracasei but clearly distinguishable from the remaining colonies owing to the color difference. these  colonies were then subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in order to identify the lcs. the viable counts of lcs were 6.6+/-0.7 log(10) cfu/g feces after intake of yakult and 6.5+/-0.6 log(10) cfu/g feces after intake of yakult light (mean+/-sd).

TI  == comparative evaluation of automated ribotyping and rapd-pcr for typing of lactobacillus spp. occurring in dental caries.
AB  == a group of 67 lactobacillus spp. strains containing lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius species isolated  from early childhood caries and identified to the species level in a previous study (svec et al., folia microbiol 54:53-58, 2009) was characterized by automated ribotyping performed by the riboprinter microbial characterization system and by randomly amplified polymorphic dna fingerprinting (rapd-pcr) with m13 primer to evaluate these techniques for characterization of lactobacilli associated with dental caries. ribotyping revealed 55 riboprints among the analysed group. the automatic identification process performed by the riboprinter system identified 18 strains to the species level, however cluster analysis divided obtained ribotype patterns into individual clusters mostly corresponding  to the species assignment of particular strains. rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed by the individual lactobacillus spp. showed higher variability than the ribotype  patterns and the fingerprint profiles generated by the analysed species were distributed among one to four clusters. in conclusion, ribotyping is shown to be  more convenient for the identification purposes while rapd-pcr fingerprinting results indicate this method is a better tool for typing of lactobacillus spp. strains occurring in dental caries.

TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == inhibitory effects of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus on salmonella lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction in a co-culture model using caco-2/peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory and reinforcing barrier effects of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus (lcr35) on caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells already exposed to salmonella lps. using the transwell co-culture model, salmonella lps was apically added to polarized caco-2 cells co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) in the basolateral compartment. lps-stimulated caco-2 cells were incubated with lcr35 for 1, 6, 24 or 48 h. apical inoculation of lcr35 after 48 h significantly inhibited the basolateral secretion of interleukin-8 (il-8) in the caco-2/pbmc co-culture. the  pcr analysis showed that lcr35 significantly downregulated mrna expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1) (p<0.05) and had a trend of decreasing mrna expression of il-8 (p=0.05), but did not alter mrna expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 in lps-stimulated caco-2 cells at 48 h after addition of lcr35. compared to non-lps-pretreated controls, transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of the polarized caco-2 cell monolayers pretreated with lps for 48 h was decreased by 9.9 % (p<0.05). additionally, compared to those cells only treated with lps, apical co-incubation with lcr35 showed biphasic teer levels increased by 12.1 % (p<0.001), 5.7 % (p<0.05) and 86.8 % (p<0.001) in the caco-2 cell monolayers compared to those without lcr35 treatment after 1, 6 and 48 h, respectively. in conclusion, lcr35 can exert anti-inflammatory effects and ameliorate barrier dysfunction in the salmonella lps-pretreated inflamed intestinal epithelium in vitro.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == probiotics: multifarious oral vaccine against infectious traumas.
AB  == microorganisms have been used for a long time in food and alcoholic fermentation. in the last few years they have undergone scientific scrutiny of their preventative and therapeutic aspects. this has led to the discovery of a new term, probiotics. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are microbial communities normally present in the intestine of most animals. they play an important role in humans and other animals, and act as immunomodulators. they are helpful in the treatment and prevention of disease as well as improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients. probiotic microorganisms include the lab lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. use of these live bacteria to elicit an immune response  or to carry a vaccine component is a new invention in vaccine development. the advantage of live bacterial vaccines is that they mimic natural infection, have intrinsic adjuvant properties and can be given orally. components of pathogenic and nonpathogenic food-related microorganisms are currently being evaluated as candidates for oral vaccines.

TI  == lactobacillus casei abundance is associated with profound shifts in the infant gut microbiome.
AB  == colonization of the infant gut by microorganisms over the first year of life is crucial for development of a balanced immune response. early alterations in the gastrointestinal microbiota of neonates has been linked with subsequent development of asthma and atopy in older children. here we describe high-resolution culture-independent analysis of stool samples from 6-month old infants fed daily supplements of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus (lgg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomized trial of infant probiotic supplementation (tips). bacterial community composition was examined using a high-density microarray, the 16s rrna phylochip, and the microbial assemblages of infants with either high or low lgg abundance were compared. communities with high abundance of lgg exhibited promotion of phylogenetically clustered taxa including a number  of other known probiotic species, and were significantly more even in their distribution of community members. ecologically, these aspects are characteristic of communities that are more resistant to perturbation and outgrowth of pathogens. phylochip analysis also permitted identification of taxa negatively correlated with lgg abundance that have previously been associated with atopy, as well as those positively correlated that may prove useful alternative targets for investigation as alternative probiotic species. from these findings we hypothesize that a key mechanism for the protective effect of lgg supplementation on subsequent development of allergic disease is through promotion of a stable, even, and functionally redundant infant gastrointestinal community.

AB  == the effects of nine probiotic strains of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus on the growth, adhesion activity, and biofilm formation of enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) were examined. the culture supernatant of the e. faecium strain, with or without ph adjustment to a neutral  ph, had a strong bactericidal effect on eaggec, including induction of membrane damage and cell lysis. supernatants of the l. casei ss. casei and l. casei ss. rhamnosus strains also had a bactericidal effect on eaggec, but this activity was abolished by ph adjustment to a neutral ph. no inhibitory effect of the culture supernatants of bifidobacterium or e. faecalis strains was detected. adhesion of  eaggec to intestinal epithelial cells was not inhibited by the bacterial strains  tested. two strains of l. casei enhanced eaggec biofilm formation, which was characterized by increased bacterial proliferation. these results suggest that the three different bacterial species; lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and enterococcus, have different effects on eaggec, and that further analysis is required for the practical use of these bacteria as probiotics against eaggec infection.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg induces tumor regression in mice bearing orthotopic bladder tumors.
AB  == the present gold standard for bladder cancer is mycobacterium bovis, bacillus calmette guerin (bcg) immunotherapy. but it has a non-responder rate of 30-50% and side effects are common. lactobacillus casei strain shirota has been reported to reduce the incidence of recurrence in bladder cancer patients and to cure tumor-bearing mice. our aim was to determine if lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg)  could be as efficacious as bcg in a murine model of bladder cancer. mb49 bladder  cancer cells secreting human prostate-specific antigen were implanted orthotopically in female c57bl/6 mice and urinary prostate-specific antigen levels were used as a marker of tumor growth. mice were treated with either live  or lyophilized lgg given via intravesical instillation, or both oral and intravesical lgg given once a week for a period of 6 weeks starting at day 4 after tumor implantation. a comparison of lgg and bcg immunotherapy was also carried out. lgg therapy (live or lyophilized) significantly (p = 0.006) increased the number of cured mice. cytokine arrays and immune cell recruitment analysis revealed differences between untreated, treated, cured, and tumor-bearing mice. lgg therapy restored xcl1 levels to those in healthy bladders. lgg also recruited large numbers of neutrophils and macrophages to the  tumor site. intravesical lgg and bcg immunotherapy had cure rates of 89 and 77%,  respectively, compared with 20% in untreated mice. lgg has the potential to replace bcg immunotherapy for the treatment of bladder cancer.

TI  == an in vitro study on bacterial growth interactions and intestinal epithelial cell adhesion characteristics of probiotic combinations.
AB  == the aims of this study were to examine long-term growth interactions of five probiotic strains (lactobacillus casei 01, lactobacillus plantarum ha8, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 55730 and bifidobacterium  lactis bb12) either alone or in combination with propionibacterium jensenii 702 in a co-culture system and to determine their adhesion ability to human colon adenocarcinoma cell line caco-2. growth patterns of probiotic lactobacillus strains were not considerably affected by the presence of p. jensenii 702, whereas lactobacilli exerted a strong antagonistic action against p. jensenii 702. in the co-culture of bif. lactis bb12 and p. jensenii 702, a significant synergistic influence on growth of both bacteria was observed (p < 0.05). the results of adhesion assay showed that when probiotic strains were tested in combination, there was evidence of an associated effect on percentage adherence.  however, in most cases these differences were not statistically significant (p <  0.05). adhesion percentage of lb. casei 01 and lb. rhamnosus gg both decreased significantly in the presence of p. jensenii 702 compared to their adhesion levels when alone (p < 0.05). these results show that the survival and percentage adhesion of some probiotic strains may be influenced by the presence of other strains and this should be considered when formulating in the probiotic products.

AB  == recent investigations clearly indicate that the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 can be incorporated into vegetables to obtain innovative probiotic foods whose marketing has been authorized by the italian ministry of health. in this study, strain impc2.1 was characterized at a molecular level in order to define its taxonomic position and to develop a pcr test for strain-specific identification. molecular methods, such as 16s rrna gene sequencing and multiplex pcr, have provided evidence that strain impc2.1 indeed belongs to the l. paracasei species. in addition, a cluster analysis of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (f-aflp) data strongly indicated that strain impc2.1 and nine other l. paracasei strains (including strain atcc 334) belong to the same species and are definitely differentiated from the type strain l. casei atcc 393. the f-aflp technique was also used to identify a strain-specific dna fragment of l. paracasei impc2.1 - encoding an amino acid sequence similar to a glycosyltransferase of probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus hn001 - which enabled us to develop a rapid pcr test for  strain-specific identification. the strain-specificity of the pcr test was assessed by comparison with a total of 73 bacterial strains mainly isolated from  vegetable products that did not produce any amplified fragment. these strains belonged to the l. paracasei species, to 6 additional species of lactobacillus and to weissella cibaria, w. confusa, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus pentosaceus. a method similar to the one used in this study can be adopted to develop easy, rapid detection techniques for monitoring other bacteria in complex microbiota.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli isolated from two italian hard cheeses.
AB  == one hundred forty-one lactobacilli strains isolated from natural whey starter cultures and ripened grana padano and parmigiano reggiano cheeses were tested for their susceptibility to 13 antibiotics, in particular, penicillin g, ampicillin,  amoxicillin, oxacillin, cephalotin, cefuroxime, vancomycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, and nitrofurantoin. the  strains belonged to the species lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. casei. the strains of the first two species were isolated from whey starter cultures, and the strains of the last two species were from the ripened cheeses. significant differences among the strains in their antibiotic resistance were found in relation to the type of cheese and, especially, the strains from parmigiano reggiano were more resistant to gentamicin and penicillin g. the strains isolated in the ripened cheese were generally more resistant than those isolated from natural whey starter cultures;  in particular, significant differences regarding oxacillin, vancomycin, cephalotin, and co-trimoxazole were observed. finally, no significant difference  in relation to the type of cheese was found among the thermophilic lactobacilli isolated from whey cultures, while the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli isolated from parmigiano reggiano showed higher resistance toward gentamicin and penicillin g than did the same species isolated from grana padano.

TI  == assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. methods and results: probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. bif. longum b6 (53.6%) and lact. rhamnosus gg (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in ped. acidilactici (10.4%). bifidobacterium longum b6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), shigella boydii (42.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had the strong binding ability to caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, sh. boydii and staph. aureus to caco-2  cells. the hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and  competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion  and in vivo colonization. conclusion: the results suggest that bif. longum b6 and lact. rhamnosus gg can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. significance and impact of the study: because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the gi tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.

TI  == production of exopolysaccharides by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains of  human origin, and metabolic activity of the producing bacteria in milk.
AB  == this work reports on the physicochemical characterization of 21 exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, as well as the growth and metabolic activity of the eps-producing strains in milk. the strains belong to the species  lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum. the molar mass distribution of eps fractions showed 2 peaks of different sizes, which is a feature shared with some eps from bacteria of food origin. in general, we detected an association between the eps size distribution and the eps-producing species, although because of the low numbers of human bacterial eps tested, we could not conclusively establish a correlation. the main monosaccharide components of the eps under study were glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, which are the same as those found in food polymers; however, the rhamnose and glucose ratios was generally higher than the  galactose ratio in our human bacterial eps. all eps-producing strains were able to grow and acidify milk; most lactobacilli produced lactic acid as the main metabolite. the lactic acid-to-acetic acid ratio in bifidobacteria was 0.7, close to the theoretical ratio, indicating that the eps-producing strains did not produce an excessive amount of acetic acid, which could adversely affect the sensory properties of fermented milks. with respect to their viscosity-intensifying ability, l. plantarum h2 and l. rhamnosus e41 and e43r were able to increase the viscosity of stirred, fermented milks to a similar extent as the eps-producing streptococcus thermophilus strain used as a positive  control. therefore, these human eps-producing bacteria could be used as adjuncts  in mixed cultures for the formulation of functional foods if probiotic characteristics could be demonstrated. this is the first article reporting the physicochemical characteristics of eps isolated from human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == preferential promotion of apoptosis of monocytes by lactobacillus casei rhamnosus soluble factors.
AB  == background & aims: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is characterized by dense infiltrates of and defective apoptosis by mucosal cell populations. some probiotics inhibit monocytes' expansion, although mechanisms remain unknown. supernatants of lactobacillus strains were investigated for inducing apoptosis of monocytes. methods: secreted factors produced by lactobacillus strains were tested on human lymphocytes, monocytes and a human monocytic leukemia-cell line (thp-1). cell death mechanisms were investigated by a variety of methods. lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced proinflammatory cytokines (il-1beta, il-6, il-8, tnf-alpha) and anti-inflammatory tgf-beta1 were determined. results: soluble factor(s) from lactobacillus casei rhamnosus strain supernatants (lcrs) effectively induced apoptosis of immune cells. these were mainly soluble proteins (mw 5-30 kda; lcrs(5-30)). for immune cells, but not human colonic epithelial carcinoma cells (ht-29), pretreatment with lcrs(5-30) significantly promoted apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway. lcrs(5-30) suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines and induced anti-inflammatory tgf-beta1. conclusions: probiotic lcr produced heat-stable molecules (mw range 5-30 kda) that promoted immune cell apoptosis without affecting intestinal epithelial cells. lcrs(5-30) triggered apoptosis by a mitochondrial pathway, but not via tgf-beta signaling pathway. lcrs(5-30) also inhibited lps-induced inflammatory cytokines by immune cells. thus, lcrs(5-30) promotes apoptosis of immune cells, and suggests probiotics-based regimens for prevention of ibd.

TI  == functional analysis of the plasmid pm4 replicon from lactobacillus plantarum m4:  determination of the minimal replicon and functionality identification of the putative sso.
AB  == in order to determine the minimal replicon and the single strand origin (sso) of  the plasmid pm4, different fragments of pm4 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and cloned into pbem, a replication probe vector for lactobacillus. the deletion analysis results showed that the minimal replicon of  pm4 could be determined within a 1280bp fragment consisting of double strand origin (dso) and rep gene encoding replication protein. based on plasmid segregation stability assay and its ability to convert single-stranded dna (ssdna) to double-stranded dna (dsdna) by southern hybridization, an sso of replication was located at nucleotides -118-92 in the plasmid pm4, about 300bp upstream of dso. in addition, the host range assay indicated that plasmid pm4 could replicate in l. casei 05-21, l. rhamnosus as 1.2466(t) and l. plantarum 05-19 of all the tested lactobacillus strains. analysis of the pm4 replicon will  allow its use in constructing a food-grade vector for application in food industry.

TI  == lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  == a group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ecc) affected children treated in the department of pedodontics (children's teaching hospital, brno, czech republic). biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by api 50 ch kit and conventional tube tests. the rep-pcr fingerprinting with the (gtg)(5) primer was  used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. in total, 20 strains of lactobacillus fermentum, 17 l. rhamnosus, 14 l. casei/paracasei, 7 l. gasseri, 7 l. salivarius  and 4 l. plantarum were identified. mixtures of two or even three lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. results obtained by biotyping and (gtg)(5)-pcr were generally comparable except for l. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. our  results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.

TI  == bacteriophages of lactobacillus.
AB  == in this review, we are listing lactobacillus phages that have been reported in peer-reviewed articles published since 1960. putative phages that are defective or have not been shown to be infectious, such as phage-like particles, are not discussed. our literature searches led to the identification of 231 lactobacillus phages, 186 of which have been observed by electron microscopy, with 109 belonging to the siphoviridae family, 76 to the myoviridae family, and 1 to the podoviridae family. model phages infecting lb delbrueckii, casei, rhamnosus, plantarum, and gasseri are highlighted, as well as prophages of lactobacillus hosts. to date, nine complete lactobacillus phage genomes are available for comparisons and evolution studies. features such as phage receptors and endolysins are also reviewed, as well as phage-derived genetic tools. lactobacillus phage research has progressed significantly over the past decade but a thorough understanding of their biology is still lacking. because of the risks they represent and the knowledge gaps that need to be filled, the outlook for research on lactobacillus phages is bright.

TI  == shotgun mass mapping of lactobacillus species and subspecies from caries related  isolates by maldi-ms.
AB  == a taxonomical study of 90 isolates of lactobacilli isolated from soft and hard carious dentine of 70 deciduous molars is presented. the lactobacillus strains were determined by shotgun mass mapping (smm). this method based on maldi-ms analysis of lactobacillus isolates treated with trypsin followed by database comparison against a library of mass spectra derived from 20 reference strains. the smm method allowed to discriminate different lactobacillus subspecies. the method was used to analyse lactobacillus isolates of unknown identity derived from carious dentine. application of the smm method to isolates from hard carious dentine revealed a nearly similar distribution of l. paracasei ss paracasei (29%), l. paracasei ss tolerans (32%) and l. casei ss rhamnosus (23%) as dominant subspecies. on the other hand, samples derived from soft carious dentine showed a clear bias only to l. paracasei ss paracasei (60%), whereas l. paracasei ss tolerans (14%) and l. casei ss rhamnosus (12%) were clear minorities. compared to existent methods, smm has unique potential for the analysis of lactobacillus strains on subspecies level.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of rep3123 against clostridium difficile and other  anaerobic intestinal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the anaerobic spectrum of activity of rep3123, a novel diaryldiamine that inhibits bacterial methionyl-trna synthetases in gram-positive bacteria. methods: fifty recent clinical isolates of clostridium difficile from patients diagnosed with c. difficile infection and 223 other intestinal normal flora anaerobes were tested for their susceptibility to rep3123 and four or five comparator agents by the agar dilution method using supplemented brucella agar with 5% laked sheep blood. results: all strains of c.  difficile were inhibited by 0.5-1 mg/l rep3123, including those resistant to moxifloxacin and clindamycin. rep3123 lacked activity against many normal flora anaerobes in the gut, including clostridium ramosum, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli of the lactobacillus casei-rhamnosus-plantarum group and gram-negative anaerobes. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated good potency against c. difficile, but limited  activity against many other intestinal anaerobic species, thus, in theory, maintaining the colonization resistance barrier.

TI  == altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  == background: early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while clostridium (c.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. objective: to relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development  during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. methods: fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. bacterial dna was analysed with real-time pcr and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. primers binding to c. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and bacteroides fragilis were used. children regarded as  allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. results: children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group i (lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus, l. casei, l. paracasei), bifidobacterium adolescentis and c. difficile during their first 2 months. infants colonized with several bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. conclusion: a more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy,  family size and endotoxin exposure.

TI  == characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
AB  == aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5),  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis  (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c  for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents  and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus gg (lgg) and its conditioned media (cm) in stimulated caco-2 cells and  to characterize the components of lgg that have the anti-inflammatory effect. material and methods: caco-2 cells were stimulated with il-1beta with or without  lgg or lgg-cm. production of il-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the transcriptional activities of the il-8 gene and the nf-kappab-responsive gene were evaluated by a transient transfection of the luciferase reporter gene. the effect on ikappabalpha degradation was evaluated by western blot analysis. to determine the nature of the immunomodulatory molecules, the lgg was modified to the following: treated with antibiotics, 4% formaldehyde, incubation at 95 degrees c, or sonication. results: we demonstrated that the pretreatment of caco-2 cells with lgg significantly inhibited il-1beta-induced il-8 production. furthermore, lgg attenuated the il-1beta-induced transcriptional activation of the il-8 gene and the nf-kappab-responsive gene, and attenuated the il-1beta-induced ikappabalpha degradation. formaldehyde-fixed or antibiotics-treated lgg maintained the inhibitory effect, but heated lgg lost this effect. sonicated lgg debris had a similar inhibitory effect with whole bacterial cells. lgg-cm attenuated il-1beta-induced il-8 production. this effect  was maintained even when the conditioned media were heated. conclusions: lgg inhibited il-1beta-induced il-8 production in caco-2 and this effect occurred at  the transcriptional level, at least in part, by inhibition of the nf-kappab signaling pathway. both the structural material of lgg and the soluble factor secreted from lgg inhibited the il-1beta-induced il-8 production, and thus different substances may cause the effects.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei suppress escherichia coli-induced chemokine expression in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == background: recently, some strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been reported to prevent the development of atopic dermatitis and to improve allergic  symptoms, especially in young children. however, the mechanisms involved in these effects are not fully understood. intestinal microbiota play critical roles in the development of host immune development and are recognized and regulated by the host through intestinal epithelial cells (iecs). we thus hypothesized that lab influence the host immune system through the activation of iecs. to begin testing this hypothesis, chemokine expression in iecs exposed to intestinal bacteria was investigated. methods: caco-2 cell monolayers were stimulated with different concentrations of various live or heat-killed intestinal bacteria or bacterial components for up to 3 h. changes in the gene expressions of various chemokines were measured using quantitative real-time pcr. results: the expressions of ccl20, cxcl8, cxcl10 and cx3cl1 were strongly induced by nonpathogenic escherichia coli in a dose-dependent manner and were partially induced by some commensal lab. in contrast, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and  lactobacillus casei did not induce these chemokine expressions. in addition, lgg  significantly suppressed the expressions of ccl20 and cxcl10 induced by e. coli,  peptidoglycan or flagellin when cultured simultaneously. conclusions: lgg and l.  casei markedly suppressed e. coli-induced chemokine expression, presumably through the suppression of the toll-like receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway, at least in part. the clinical importance of this suppressive effect and the mechanisms involved require further investigation; however, such effects can  be used as a marker to identify clinically useful lab.

TI  == microbiological, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured with adjunct lactobacillus strains using a low cooking temperature.
AB  == the effect of nonstarter lactobacillus adjunct cultures on the microbial, chemical, and sensory characteristics of swiss cheese manufactured using the "kosher make procedure" was investigated. the kosher make procedure, which uses a lower cooking temperature than traditional swiss cheese making, is used by many american cheese manufacturers to allow for kosher-certified whey. cheeses were manufactured using a commercial starter culture combination and 1 of 3 non-starter lactobacillus strains previously isolated from swiss cheeses, lactobacillus casei a26, l. casei b21, and lactobacillus rhamnosus h2, as an adjunct. control cheeses lacked the adjunct culture. cheeses were analyzed during ripening for microbial and chemical composition. adjunct strain l. casei a26, which utilized citrate most readily in laboratory medium, dominated the lactobacillus population within 30 d, faster than the other adjunct cultures. there were no significant differences in propionibacterium counts, streptococcus  thermophilus counts, protein, fat, moisture, salt, and ph among the cheeses. free amino acid concentration ranged from 5 to 7 mmol/100 g of cheese at 90 d of ripening and was adjunct strain dependent. lactic, acetic, and propionic acid concentrations were not significantly different among the cheeses after a 90-d ripening period; however differences in propionic acid concentrations were apparent at 60 d, with the cheeses made with l. casei adjuncts containing less propionic acid. citric acid was depleted by the end of warm room ripening in cheeses manufactured with adjunct l. casei strains, but not with adjunct l. rhamnosus. cheeses made with l. casei a26 were most similar to the control cheeses in diacetyl and butyric/isobutyric acid abundance as evaluated by electronic nose during the first 3 mo of ripening. the 4 cheese types differed in their descriptive sensory profiles at 8 mo of age, indicating an adjunct strain-dependent effect on particular flavor attributes. adjunct lactobacillus spp. affected the flavor profile and concentration of some flavor compounds in swiss cheeses produced with the kosher make procedure. use of adjunct lactobacillus cultures provides swiss cheese makers using a low cooking temperature with a means to control the dominant lactobacillus strain during ripening, reduce citrate concentration, and modify cheese flavor.

AB  == lactic acid production by recycle batch fermentation using immobilized cells of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus was studied. the culture medium was composed of whey treated with an endoprotease, and supplemented with 2.5 g/l of yeast extract and 0.18 mm mn(2+) ions. the fermentation set-up comprised of a column packed with polyethyleneimine-coated foam glass particles, pora-bact a, and connected with recirculation to a stirred tank reactor vessel for ph control. the immobilization of l. casei was performed simply by circulating the culture medium inoculated with the organism over the beads. at this stage, a long lag period preceded the cell growth and lactic acid production. subsequently, for recycle batch fermentations using the immobilized cells, the reducing sugar concentration of the medium was increased to 100 g/l by addition of glucose. the lactic acid production started immediately after onset of fermentation and the average reactor productivity during repeated cycles was about 4.3 to 4.6 g/l . h, with complete substrate utilization and more than 90% product yield. sugar consumption and lactate yield were maintained at the same level with increase in medium volume up to at least 10 times that of the immobilized biocatalyst. the liberation of significant amounts of cells into the medium limited the number of  fermentation cycles possible in a recycle batch mode. use of lower yeast extract  concentration reduced the amount of suspended biomass without significant change  in productivity, thereby also increasing the number of fermentation cycles, and even maintained the d-lactate amount at low levels. the product was recovered from the clarified and decolorized broth by ion-exchange adsorption.

TI  == probiotic bacteria affect the composition of salivary pellicle and streptococcal  adhesion in vitro.
AB  == introduction: the use of probiotic bacteria is increasing worldwide and at least  some of them can transiently colonize the oral cavity. several studies have shown that probiotic bacteria, which are often thought of in relation only to intestinal health, can also affect the oral ecology, but the mechanisms for this  are largely unknown. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro if the probiotic bacteria used in commercial products affect the protein composition of  the salivary pellicle and the adherence of other oral bacteria. methods: salivary pellicle on hydroxyapatite and the adhesion of two oral streptococci, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus gordonii, were used as a model. results: probiotic bacteria that bound to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite reduced the adhesion of s. mutans but the inhibitory effect on the adherence of s. gordonii was weaker. salivary pellicle protein composition was modified by all the strains tested. the modifications in the pellicle affected the adherence of s. mutans but not of s. gordonii. two of the proteins missing from the pellicles made of saliva-treated with the probiotic bacteria were identified as salivary agglutinin gp340 and salivary peroxidase. all bacterial strains bound salivary agglutinin gp340. the ability of the probiotic bacteria to degrade peroxidase was demonstrated with purified bovine lactoperoxidase and two of the probiotic strains. conclusion: this in vitro study showed that probiotic strains used in commercial products may affect the oral ecology by specifically preventing the adherence of other bacteria and by modifying the protein composition of the salivary pellicle.

TI  == single bioreactor gastrointestinal tract simulator for study of survival of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design an in vitro model system to evaluate the probiotic potential of food. a single bioreactor system-gastrointestinal tract simulator (gits) was chosen for process simulation on account of its considerable simplicity compared to multi-vessel systems used in previous studies. the bioreactor was evaluated by studying the viability of four known probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533, lactobacillus casei strain shirota, and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg) as a function of their physiological state. l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii survived in gits better when introduced at an early stationary or exponential phase compared to being previously stored for 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. these two species were more resistant to bile salts and survived better than l. casei and l. rhamnosus gg. the latter two species gave large losses (up to 6 log) in plate counts independent of growth state due to the bile. however, experiments with some commercial probiotic products containing lb. gg bacteria showed much better  survival compared with model food (modified deman-rogosa-sharpe growth medium), thus demonstrating the influence of the food matrix on the viability of bacteria. the study demonstrated that gits can be successfully used for evaluation of viability of probiotic bacteria and functionality of probiotic food.

TI  == the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus stimulates chloride/hydroxyl exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == probiotics are viable nonpathogenic microorganisms that are considered to confer  health benefits to the host. recent studies indicated that some lactobacillus species function as probiotics and have been used as alternative treatments for diarrhea, which occurs due to increased secretion, decreased absorption, or both. however, the direct effects of probiotics on intestinal electrolyte absorption are not known. therefore, we examined the effects of lactobacillus on luminal chloride/hydroxyl (cl(-)/oh(-)) exchange activity in human intestinal epithelial  cells. postconfluent caco-2 cells were treated with the lactobacillus species lactobacillus acidophilus (la), lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, or  lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr) for 3 h at a multiplicity of infection of 50. cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was measured as 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive (36)cl uptake in base-loaded cells. treatment with live, but not heat-killed, la and lr significantly increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity (approximately 50%), whereas other species were ineffective. similarly,  the conditioned medium (supernatant) of live la increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange. the ability of la or its conditioned culture medium to enhance cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity was blocked by pi-3 kinase inhibition but was unaffected by inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases. corresponding to the increased cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity, la treatment increased the surface expression of the apical anion exchanger, slc26a3 [down regulated in adenoma (dra)]. the increased dra membrane localization might contribute to the increased cl(-) absorption by la. our results suggest that la secretes soluble effector molecule(s) into the culture medium that stimulate apical cl(-)/oh(-) exchange activity via phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase mediated mechanism.

TI  == genome sequence and characteristics of lrm1, a prophage from industrial lactobacillus rhamnosus strain m1.
AB  == prophage lrm1 was induced with mitomycin c from an industrial lactobacillus rhamnosus starter culture, m1. electron microscopy of the lysate revealed relatively few intact bacteriophage particles among empty heads and disassociated tails. the defective siphoviridae phage had an isometric head of approximately 55 nm and noncontractile tail of about 275 nm with a small baseplate. in repeated attempts, the prophage could not be cured from l. rhamnosus m1, nor could a sensitive host be identified. sequencing of the phage lrm1 dna revealed a genome  of 39,989 bp and a g+c content of 45.5%. a similar genomic organization and mosaic pattern of identities align lrm1 among the closely related lactobacillus casei temperate phages a2, phiat3, and lcai and with l. rhamnosus virulent phage  lu-nu. of the 54 open reading frames (orfs) identified, all but 8 shared homology with other phages of this group. five unknown orfs were identified that had no homologies in the databases nor predicted functions. notably, lrm1 encodes a putative endonuclease and a putative dna methylase with homology to a methylase in lactococcus lactis phage tuc2009. possibly, the dna methylase, endonuclease, or other lrm1 genes provide a function crucial to l. rhamnosus m1 survival, resulting in the stability of the defective prophage in its lysogenic state. the  presence of a defective prophage in an industrial strain could provide superinfection immunity to the host but could also contribute dna in recombination events to produce new phages potentially infective for the host strain in a large-scale fermentation environment.

TI  == oral probiotic and prevention of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in intensive care unit patients.
AB  == introduction: preventing carriage of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms from  the aerodigestive tract is an infection control strategy used to reduce the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units. however, antibiotic use in selective decontamination protocols is controversial. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral administration of a probiotic, namely lactobacillus, on gastric and respiratory tract colonization/infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. our hypothesis was that an indigenous flora should exhibit a protective effect against secondary colonization. methods: we conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study between march 2003 and october 2004 in a 17-bed intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in clermont-ferrand, france. consecutive patients with a unit stay of longer than 48 hours were included, 106  in the placebo group and 102 in the probiotic group. through a nasogastric feeding tube, patients received either 109 colony-forming units unity forming colony of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus or placebo twice daily, from the third day after admission to discharge. digestive tract carriage of p. aeruginosa was monitored by cultures of gastric aspirates at admission, once a week thereafter and on discharge. in addition, bacteriological analyses of respiratory tract specimens were conducted to determine patient infectious status. results: the occurrence of p. aeruginosa respiratory colonization and/or infection was significantly delayed in the probiotic group, with a difference in median delay to acquisition of 11 days versus 50 days (p = 0.01), and a nonacquisition expectancy mean of 69 days versus 77 days (p = 0.01). the occurrence of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to p. aeruginosa in the patients receiving the probiotic was less frequent, although not significantly reduced, in patients  in the probiotic group (2.9%) compared with those in the placebo group (7.5%). after multivariate cox proportional hazards modelling, the absence of probiotic treatment increased the risk for p. aeruginosa colonization in respiratory tract  (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.2, 95% confidence interval - 1.1 to 9.1). conclusion:  in this pilot study, oral administration of a probiotic delayed respiratory tract colonization/infection by p. aeruginosa. trial registration: the trial registration number for this study is nct00604110.

TI  == probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  == according to the german definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of l. casei or the l. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, certain enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) and the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact  with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are  basic mechanisms. they are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. in addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. well-established probiotic effects are: 1. prevention  and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. prevention or alleviation of allergies and  atopic diseases in infants. 7. prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). a prebiotic is  "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for  prebiotic classification. they are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. other health effects of prebiotics  (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect,  i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. in the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == taxonomic and strain-specific identification of the probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus 35 within the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == lactobacilli are lactic acid bacteria that are widespread in the environment, including the human diet and gastrointestinal tract. some lactobacillus strains are regarded as probiotics because they exhibit beneficial health effects on their host. in this study, the long-used probiotic strain lactobacillus rhamnosus 35 was characterized at a molecular level and compared with seven reference strains from the lactobacillus casei group. analysis of rrn operon sequences confirmed that l. rhamnosus 35 indeed belongs to the l. rhamnosus species, and both temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and ribotyping showed that it is closer to the probiotic strain l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 (also known as l. rhamnosus gg) than to the species type strain. in addition, l. casei atcc 334 gathered in a coherent cluster with l. paracasei type strains, unlike l. casei atcc 393, which was closer to l. zeae; this is evidence of the lack of relatedness between the two l. casei strains. further characterization of the eight strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis repetitive dna element-based pcr identified distinct patterns for each strain, whereas two isolates of l. rhamnosus 35 sampled 40 years apart could not be distinguished. by subtractive hybridization using the l. rhamnosus gg genome as a driver, we were able to isolate five l. rhamnosus 35-specific sequences, including two phage-related ones. the primer pairs designed to amplify these five regions allowed us to develop rapid and highly specific pcr-based identification methods for the probiotic strain l. rhamnosus 35.

TI  == use of lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus gg and gastrointestinal colonization by candida species in preterm neonates.
AB  == candida species increasingly cause morbidity and mortality in the premature infant in neonatal intensive care units, and the gut reservoir is the site from which dissemination most frequently starts in such patients. specific antifungal  prophylaxis is the most suitable strategy with which to limit the severity and the frequent neurodevelopmental impairment in survivors that is associated with neonatal invasive fungal infections. recent interest has focused on the use of probiotics for the treatment of several diseases in neonatal patients. pilot studies have implicated these organisms in necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, and urinary tract infections. other applications of probiotic therapy in preterm neonates may also include the prevention of fungal colonization and of candida-related disorders. probiotics could provide an innovative and less invasive approach because they modify the bowel flora by colonizing the gastrointestinal tract. basic research has shown that in mice models, the lactobacillus casei subsp rhamnosus gg (lgg) is effective in preventing candida gut colonization and systemic dissemination. a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in human preterm neonates has demonstrated that lgg administered in the first month of life significantly reduces enteric candida colonization. the present article summarizes the state of the art about probiotics and candida-related diseases in the preterm neonate and emphasizes the need for further investigations to determine unequivocally the possible role of lgg in the prevention and management of the fungal diseases in preterm neonates.

AB  == single laboratory method performance parameters, including the calibration curve, accuracy, recovery, precision, limit of detection (lod), and limit of quantification (loq), were evaluated for the analysis of total food folate by the trienzyme extraction and microplate assay with lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus. standard reference material (srm) 1546 (meat homogenate), srm 2383 (baby food composite), srm 1846 (infant formula), certified reference material (crm) 121 (wholemeal flour), and crm 485 (mixed vegetables), representing a broad selection of food matrices, were used to evaluate the performance of the method.  a generated 4-parameter logistic equation of the calibration curve was y= (0.0705 - 1.0396)/(1 + (x/0.0165) (1.3072)) + 1.0396 (p < 0.0001). the test of parallelism demonstrated that matrix components in the food extracts did not affect the accuracy. measured values of the srms and crms were within their certified or reference values. recoveries for all reference materials met the requirements of the aoac guidelines for single laboratory validation. precision measured as repeatability, including simultaneous and consecutive replicates for  each srm and crm, met the horwitz criterion. lod and loq values were 0.3 and 0.6  mug/100 g, respectively. the results showed that trienzyme digestion using alpha-amylase, pronase(r), and conjugase from chicken pancreas coupled with a 96-well microplate assay provided a highly accurate, reproducible, and sensitive  method for the determination of folate in a variety of foods.

TI  == lactobacillus strain diversity based on partial hsp60 gene sequences and design of pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism assays for species identification and differentiation.
AB  == a phylogenetic tree showing diversities among 116 partial (499-bp) lactobacillus  hsp60 (groel, encoding a 60-kda heat shock protein) nucleotide sequences was obtained and compared to those previously described for 16s rrna and tuf gene sequences. the topology of the tree produced in this study showed a lactobacillus species distribution similar, but not identical, to those previously reported. however, according to the most recent systematic studies, a clear differentiation of 43 single-species clusters was detected/identified among the sequences analyzed. the slightly higher variability of the hsp60 nucleotide sequences than  of the 16s rrna sequences offers better opportunities to design or develop molecular assays allowing identification and differentiation of either distant or very closely related lactobacillus species. therefore, our results suggest that hsp60 can be considered an excellent molecular marker for inferring the taxonomy  and phylogeny of members of the genus lactobacillus and that the chosen primers can be used in a simple pcr procedure allowing the direct sequencing of the hsp60 fragments. moreover, in this study we performed a computer-aided restriction endonuclease analysis of all 499-bp hsp60 partial sequences and we showed that the pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns obtainable by using both endonucleases alui and taci (in separate reactions) can allow identification and differentiation of all 43 lactobacillus species considered, with the exception of the pair l. plantarum/l. pentosus. however, the latter species can be differentiated by further analysis with sau3ai or msei. the hsp60  pcr-rflp approach was efficiently applied to identify and to differentiate a total of 110 wild lactobacillus strains (including closely related species, such  as l. casei and l. rhamnosus or l. plantarum and l. pentosus) isolated from cheese and dry-fermented sausages.

TI  == study on the protective role of selenium against cadmium toxicity in lactic acid  bacteria: an advanced application of icp-ms.
AB  == in this work, lactobacillus casei rhamnosus were obtained from the commercial product of fermented milk and possible antagonistic effect of selenium (as sodium selenite) against cadmium toxicity was studied. the bacteria capability to incorporate se was demonstrated: after 1 week exposure to se(iv), its total concentration in the freeze-dried biomass was 405+/-28 microg/g (7.4+/-0.8 microg/g in control). in the presence of se(iv) and cd(ii), the bacterial growth  and cell viability were improved and lipid peroxidation less marked with respect  to bacteria exposed to cd(ii) alone. the distribution of se and cd in molecular mass fractions of bacteria extracts was investigated by size exclusion chromatography with diode array and icp-ms detection. the results obtained suggest that the antagonistic effect of se is due to lower incorporation of cadmium at a high molecular mass (mm<600 kda). slightly different distribution of elements in the fractions of mm<40 kda suggests the formation of new chemical species involving cd and se in bacteria exposed to cd(ii)+se(iv) as compared to those exposed to cd(ii) alone. the study illustrates the high utility of atomic spectrometry to critically inform molecular questions that could be important in  the industrial processes based on bacterial activity.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. in this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. the objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in  vitro and in situ assays. milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid  8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. in addition, the tolerance to salts (nacl and kcl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. in in vitro assays, most strains  acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. fast strains decreased milk ph to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. this group consisted mostly of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. most strains showed  salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. the lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. in both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming  or equaling primary starter. overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. the lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.

AB  == the effect of different types of probiotics present in yogurt over known populations of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis was evaluated. the three types of yogurt used were: without added probiotics, with added probiotics (lactobacillus casei crl_431 and l. acidophilus crl_730 chr hansen) and another one with the same probiotics mentioned above and lactobacillus rhamnosus (lr-35) culture. about 10(9) cfu/ ml of each potentially pathogenic bacteria was added to each type of yogurt tested, and kept in refrigeration at 4 degrees c during its shelf life, about 30 days. bacterial count was done the initial day and every four days. results obtained show that there is a difference in the inhibition between yogurts without added probiotics and the commercial yogurt with added probiotics; there is a clear inhibitory effect of the last one over s. aureus, e. coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes. the yogurt with added probiotics and l. rhamnosus did not show any additional inhibitory effect over the bacteria tested  when compared with the yogurt with added probiotics. s. enteritidis could not be  evaluated because it was not detectable in any yogurt samples evaluated four days after its inoculation. this study confirms the antagonic effect of probiotic cultures over potentially pathogenic bacteria for human beings and animals that may be present in food. nevertheless, the use of l. rhamnosus did not produce any additional inhibitory effect.

AB  == goals: assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. background: probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on  the host. as a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. study: the feces of seven volunteers  were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: e. coli nissle 0.5-5 x  10(9) cells (mutaflor), enterococcus faecium sf 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (bioflorin), lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (infloran), lactobacillus gasseri and bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (omniflora), lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with lactobacillus casei immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (actimel). ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and dna was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd). typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. results: fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking bioflorin, and from 1/6 after infloran. cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of antibiophilus, omniflora and actimel. conclusions: after oral consumption of probiotics, e. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). in contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.

AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the xynotyri cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. methods and results: the co-culture of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. the killing activity was produced mainly  by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287. the culture of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 inhibited the penetration of s. typhimurium sl1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. in conventional mice infected with s. typhimurium sl1344, the intake of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 results in a decrease in the levels of salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those  present in the intestinal contents. in germ-free mice, the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. conclusions: the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 strain exerts anti-salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029 and lactobacillus johnsonii la1. significance and impact of the study: the observation that a selected cheese lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.

TI  == multilocus sequence typing of lactobacillus casei reveals a clonal population structure with low levels of homologous recombination.
AB  == robust genotyping methods for lactobacillus casei are needed for strain tracking  and collection management, as well as for population biology research. a collection of 52 strains initially labeled l. casei or lactobacillus paracasei was first subjected to rplb gene sequencing together with reference strains of lactobacillus zeae, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and other species. phylogenetic analysis showed that all 52 strains belonged to a single compact l. casei-l. paracasei sequence cluster, together with strain cip107868 (= atcc 334) but clearly distinct from l. rhamnosus and from a cluster with l. zeae and cip103137(t) (= atcc 393(t)). the strains were genotyped using amplified fragment length polymorphism, multilocus sequence typing based on internal portions of the seven housekeeping genes fusa, iles, lepa, leus, pyrg, reca, and recg, and tandem repeat variation (multilocus variable-number tandem repeats analysis [mlva] using nine loci). very high concordance was found between the three methods. although amounts of nucleotide variation were low for the seven genes (pi ranging from 0.0038 to 0.0109), 3 to 12 alleles were distinguished, resulting in 31 sequence types. one sequence type (st1) was frequent (17 strains), but most others were represented by a single strain. attempts to subtype st1 strains by mlva, ribotyping, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat characterization, and single nucleotide repeat variation were unsuccessful. we found clear evidence for homologous recombination during the diversification of l. casei clones, including a putative intragenic import of dna into one strain. nucleotides were estimated to change four times more frequently by recombination  than by mutation. however, statistical congruence between individual gene trees was retained, indicating that recombination is not frequent enough to disrupt the phylogenetic signal. the developed multilocus sequence typing scheme should be useful for future studies of l. casei strain diversity and evolution.

TI  == the role of a probiotics mixture in the treatment of childhood constipation: a pilot study.
AB  == background: inconsistent data exist about the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of constipation. several studies in adults with constipation showed positive effects of probiotics on constipation. inconsistent data exist regarding the effect of a single probiotic strain in constipated children. the aim of this  pilot study was to determine the effect of a mixture of probiotics containing bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the treatment of childhood constipation. methods: children aged 4-16 years with constipation as defined by the rome iii criteria were eligible for the study. during a 4 week period, children received a daily mix of 4 x 109 colony forming units of a probiotic mixture (ecologic(r)relief) containing bifidobacteria (b.) bifidum, b. infantis, b. longum, lactobacilli (l.) casei, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus. primary outcome measures were frequency of bowel movements (bms) per week and stool consistency.  secondary outcome measures were number of faecal incontinence episodes per week,  abdominal pain and side effects. results: twenty children, 50% male, median age 8 (range 4-16) were included. the frequency of bms per week increased from 2.0 (1.0-5.0) to 4.2 (0.0-16.0) in week 2 (p = 0.10) and 3.8 (2.1-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.13). in 12 children presenting with <3 bms/week, bms per week increased significantly from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) to 3.0 (0.0-7.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 3.0 (0.0-10.0) in week 4 (p = 0.01). the stool consistency was reported as hard in 7  children at baseline, in 4 children at week 2 (p = 0.23) and in 6 children after  4 weeks of treatment (p = 1.00). a significant decrease in number of faecal incontinence episodes per week was found in the entire group: 4.0 (0.0-35.0) to 1.5 (0.0-14.0) in week 2 (p = 0.01) and 0.3 (0.0-7.0) in week 4 (p = 0.001). the  presence of abdominal pain decreased significantly from 45% to 25% in week 2 (p = 0.04) and 20% at week 4 (p = 0.006). no side effects were reported. conclusion: this pilot study shows that a mixture of probiotics, has positive effects on symptoms of constipation. to confirm these findings, a large randomised placebo controlled trial is required.

TI  == preliminary characterization of wild lactic acid bacteria and their abilities to  produce flavour compounds in ripened model cheese system.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to preliminary characterize wild lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously isolated during artisanal pecorino siciliano (ps) cheese-making for technological and flavour formation abilities in a model cheese system. methods and results: twelve lab were studied for the ability to grow at 10 and 45 degrees c, to coagulate and acidify both reconstituted skim milk and ewe's milk. moreover, the capacity of the strains to generate aroma compounds was evaluated in a model cheese system at 30- and 60-day ripening. flavour compounds  were screened by sensory analysis and throughout gas chromatography (gc)-mass spectrometry (ms). most of the strains were able to grow both at 10 and 45 degrees c and exhibited high ability to acidify and coagulate ewes' milk. sensory evaluation revealed that the wild strains produced more significant flavour attributes than commercial strains in the 60-day-old model cheese system. gc-ms data confirmed the results of sensory evaluations and showed the ability of wild  lactobacilli to generate key volatile compounds. particularly, three wild lactobacilli strains, belonging to lactobacillus casei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum species, generated both in 60- and 30-day-old model cheeses system, the 3-methyl butan(al)(ol) compound, which is associated with fruity taste. conclusions: the present work preliminarily demonstrated that the technological and flavour formation abilities of the wild strains are strain-specific and that  wild lactobacilli, which produced key flavour compounds during ripening, could be used as tailor-made starters. significance and impact of the study: this study reports the technological characterization and flavour formation ability of wild  lab strains isolated from artisanal pecorino cheese and highlights that the catabolic activities were highly strain dependent. hence, wild lactobacilli could be selected as tailor-made starter cultures for the ps cheese manufacture.

TI  == evidence for in vitro anti-genotoxicity of cheese non-starter lactobacilli.
AB  == the inhibition of direct acting dna reactive agents by 63 non-starter lactobacilli isolated from raw ewes milk cheeses was examined by short-term assay (sos-chromotest) and compared with already characterized starter lactobacilli. the screening revealed strains active against the nitroarene 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (nqo) and the alkylating agent n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) in different species of the genus lactobacillus (l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. plantarum, l. brevis, lactobacillus spp.). it was proved that the anti-genotoxicity was strain-dependent, and always  associated with spectroscopic modification of genotoxins. the frequency of strains inhibiting nitroarene genotoxicity was comparable for non-starter and starter lactobacilli, whereas inhibition of the alkylating agent was largely predominant in non-starter isolates. seventeen strains presented inhibitory activity against both genotoxins. dna rapd-pcr performed with m13, pro-up and rpo2 primers on the lactobacilli under examination showed genetic diversity in these strains. the non-starter isolates clustered in seven groups and the strains presenting a high degree of activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide clustered in a single group with a similarity around 75%. interestingly, the strains with anti-genotoxic properties also showed acid-bile tolerance, indicating that the autochthonous lactobacilli which survive cheese ripening may also reach the gut as viable cells and could prevent genotoxin dna damage to enterocytes, as is desirable for probiotic bacteria.

TI  == lactobacillus casei rhamnosus lcr35 in children with chronic constipation.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present paper was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics (lactobacillus casei rhamnosus, lcr35) for treating children with chronic constipation and to compare its effect with magnesium oxide (mgo) and placebo. methods: this double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized study enrolled 45 children under 10 years old with chronic constipation. they were randomly assigned to receive lcr35 (8 x 10(8) c.f.u./day; n = 18), mgo (50 mg/kg/day; n =  18), or placebo (n = 9) orally twice daily for 4 weeks. lactulose use (1 ml/kg per day) was allowed when no stool passage for 3 days was noted. glycerin enema was used only when no defecation was noted for >5 days or abdominal pain was suffered due to stool impaction. bacterial cultures of stool were performed before and after treatment to evaluate the change of intestinal flora. comparisons of the frequency of defecation, consistency of stool and the use of lactulose or enema during the period of treatment were made among the three groups. results: the patients who received mgo or probiotics had a higher defecation frequency (p = 0.03), higher percentage of treatment success (p = 0.01), less use of glycerin enema (p = 0.04) and less hard stool (p = 0.01) than  the placebo group. there was no significant difference between mgo and probiotic  groups in the aforementioned comparisons. the first effect of mgo (second week) on constipation was slightly earlier than that of probiotic (second to third week). abdominal pain occurred less frequently in the probiotic group than in both the mgo and the placebo groups (p = 0.03). there was no statistically significant difference among the three groups in the use of lactulose, episodes of fecal soiling, and change of appetite. no adverse effect was noted in probiotic and placebo groups. only one patient in the mgo group suffered from mild diarrhea. conclusion: lcr35 was effective in treating children with chronic  constipation. there is no statistically significant difference in efficacy between mgo and lcr35, but less abdominal pain occurred when using lcr35. study with larger case number and longer follow up is needed in the future.

TI  == conjugated linoleic acid conversion by dairy bacteria cultured in mrs broth and buffalo milk.
AB  == aims: to evaluate strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci for their ability to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) from free linoleic acid (la). methods and results: eight dairy bacteria tolerant to la were grown in mrs  broth containing la (200 microg ml(-1)) and cla was assessed. seven bacteria were able to form cla after 24 h of incubation, varying percentage conversion between  17% and 36%. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum and streptococcus thermophilus showed the highest la conversion and were  inoculated into buffalo milk supplemented with different concentration of la. the production of cla at 200 microg ml(-1) of la was two- or threefold in milk than mrs broth. all evaluated strains were able to produce cla from high la levels (1000 microg ml(-1)). conclusions: the most tolerant strain to la was lact. casei. lacttobacillus rhamnosus produced the maximum level of cla at high la concentrations (800 microg ml(-1)). the selected bacteria may be considered as adjunct cultures to be included on dairy fermented products manufacture. low concentration of la must be added to the medium to enhance cla formation. significance and impact of the study: the production of cla by strains using milks from regional farms as medium offer a possible mechanism to enhance this beneficial compound in dairy products and those the possibility to develop functional foods.

TI  == probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  == probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri, certain strains of l. casei, l. acidophilus, escherichia coli strain nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and  enterococci (enterococcus faecium sf68) as well as the probiotic yeast saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. however, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == discrimination of dairy industry isolates of the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == lactobacilli are a major part of the microflora of the gut and of many fermented  dairy products, and are found in a variety of environments. lactobacillus casei,  lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus zeae form a closely related taxonomic group within the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli. the classification and nomenclature of these bacteria are controversial. in this study, relationships between these species were investigated using type strains and dairy industry isolates examined with dna-based techniques and conventional carbohydrate use tests. carbohydrate use patterns gave poor discrimination of some species, but dna pcr using specific primers targeted to sequences of the 16s rrna gene discriminated 4 types consistent with the currently recognized species. pulsed-field agarose gel electrophoresis of chromosomal noti restriction fragments identified 18 different band patterns from 21 independent lactobacillus isolates and confirmed the identity of l. casei strains from 2 culture collections (cscc 5203 and ascc 290), both representing the type strain of l. casei. some isolates were reclassified as l. rhamnosus, suggesting that the prevalence of l. rhamnosus as a natural component of the microflora of dairy foods and dairy environments has previously  been underestimated. these methods can provide a practical basis for discrimination of the species and identification of individual industrial strains.

TI  == induction of interleukin-12 by lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion.
AB  == some strains of lactobacilli can stimulate macrophages and dendritic cells to secrete il-12, which plays a key role in activating innate immunity. we examined  the il-12-inducing ability of 47 lactobacillus strains belonging to 10 species in mouse peritoneal macrophages, and characterized the properties important for the  induction of il-12. although considerable differences in il-12-inducing ability were observed among the strains tested, almost all strains belonging to the lactobacillus casei group (l. casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus zeae) or to lactobacillus fermentum induced high levels of il-12. phagocytosis of lactobacilli was necessary for il-12 induction, and the strains with strong il-12 induction were relatively resistant to lysis in the macrophages. the sensitivity  of lactobacillus strains to in vitro treatment with m-1 enzyme, a member of the n-acetylmuramidases, was negatively correlated with il-12-inducing ability. using a probiotic strain, l. casei strain shirota (lcs), we showed that the cell wall of lcs could be digested by long-term treatment with a high dose of m-1 enzyme and that the il-12-inducing ability was diminished according to the duration of the enzyme treatment. the soluble polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex released from the cell wall of lcs did not induce il-12, whereas the insoluble intact cell wall of lcs induced il-12. these results suggest that the intact cell wall structure of lactobacilli is an important element in the ability to induce il-12  and that lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion effectively stimulate macrophages to induce il-12.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

TI  == characterization of a new virulent phage (mlc-a) of lactobacillus paracasei.
AB  == a new virulent bacteriophage (mlc-a) was recently isolated in argentina from a probiotic dairy product containing a strain of lactobacillus paracasei. observation of the lysate with an electron microscope revealed bacteriophage particles with an icosahedral capsid of 57 +/- 2 nm; with a collar and a noncontractile tail of 156 +/- 3 nm terminating with a baseplate to which a tail  fiber was attached. therefore, phage mlc-a belongs to the siphoviridae family. this phage was able to survive the pasteurization process and was resistant to alcohols and sodium hypochlorite (400 mg/kg). only peracetic acid could inactivate high-titer suspensions of phages in a short time. the maximum rates of phage adsorption to its host cells were obtained at 30 degrees c with a ph between 5 and 7, and in the presence of calcium or magnesium ions. the host range of phage mlc-a encompassed l. paracasei and lactobacillus casei strains, but it was not able to infect lactobacillus rhamnosus or lactobacillus gasseri strains.  one-step growth kinetics of its lytic development revealed latent and burst periods of 30 and 135 min, respectively, with a burst size of about 69 +/- 4 plaque-forming units per infected cell. phage mlc-a had a distinctive restriction profile when compared with the 2 well-studied lactobacillus phages, pl-1 and j-1. the genome size of the mlc-a phage was estimated to be approximately 37 kb. this  study presents the description of the first phage specific for l. paracasei isolated in argentina. the isolation of phage mlc-a indicates that, beside lactic acid bacteria starters, probiotic cultures can also be sensitive to virulent phages in industrial processes.

TI  == oral supplementation with lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus prevents enteric colonization by candida species in preterm neonates: a randomized study.
AB  == background: colonization by candida species is the most important predictor of the development of invasive fungal disease in preterm neonates, and the enteric reservoir is a major site of colonization. we evaluated the effectiveness of an orally supplemented probiotic (lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus; dicoflor [dicofarm spa]; 6 x 10(9) cfu/day) in the prevention of gastrointestinal colonization by candida species in preterm, very low birth weight (i.e., < 1500-g) neonates during their stay in a neonatal intensive care unit. methods: over a 12-month period, a prospective, randomized, blind, clinical trial that involved 80 preterm neonates with a very low birth weight was conducted in a large tertiary neonatal intensive care unit. during the first 3 days of life, the neonates were randomly assigned to receive either an oral probiotic added to human (maternal or pooled donors') milk (group a) or human milk alone (group b) for 6 weeks or until discharge from the nicu, if the neonate was discharged before 6 weeks. on a weekly basis, specimens obtained from various sites (i.e., oropharyngeal, stool, gastric aspirate, and rectal specimens) were collected from all patients for surveillance culture, to assess the occurrence and intensity of  fungal colonization in the gastrointestinal tract. results: the incidence of fungal enteric colonization (with colonization defined as at least 1 positive culture result for specimens obtained from at least 1 site) was significantly lower in group a than in group b (23.1% vs. 48.8%; relative risk, 0.315 [95% confidence interval, 0.120-0.826]; p = .01). the numbers of fungal isolates obtained from each neonate (p = .005) and from each colonized patient (p = .005)  were also lower in group a than in group b. l. casei subspecies rhamnosus was more effective in the subgroup of neonates with a birth weight of 1001-1500 g. there were no changes in the relative proportions of the different candida strains. no adverse effects potentially associated with the probiotic were recorded. conclusions: orally administered l. casei subspecies rhamnosus significantly reduces the incidence and the intensity of enteric colonization by  candida species among very low birth weight neonates.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == viability of commercial probiotic cultures (l. acidophilus, bifidobacterium sp.,  l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) in cheddar cheese.
AB  == six batches of cheddar cheese were manufactured containing different combinations of commercially available probiotic cultures from three suppliers. duplicate cheeses contained the organisms of each supplier, a bifidobacterium spp. (each supplier), a lactobacillus acidophilus (2 suppliers), and either lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, or lactobacillus rhamnosus. using selective media, the different strains were assessed for viability during cheddar cheese maturation over 32 weeks. the bifidobacterium sp. remained at high numbers with the three strains being present in cheese at 4 x 10(7), 1.4 x 10(8), and 5 x 10(8) cfu/g after 32 weeks. similarly the l. casei (2 x 10(7) cfu/g), l. paracasei (1.6 x 10(7) cfu/g), and l. rhamnosus (9 x 10(8) cfu/g) strains survived well; however, the l. acidophilus strains performed poorly with both decreasing in a similar manner to be present at 3.6 x 10(3) cfu/g and 4.9 x 10(3) cfu/g after 32 weeks. this study indicates that cheddar cheese is a good vehicle  for a variety of commercial probiotics but survival of l. acidophilus strains will need to be improved.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus bacteremia, species identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility of 85 blood isolates.
AB  == background: data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical lactobacillus isolates are scarce, and appropriate interpretation criteria for susceptibility tests are not available. methods: we examined 85 cases of lactobacillus bacteremia, of which 47 cases have been included in our previous studies. overall, 14 antimicrobial agents were evaluated by the e-test method, and these results were compared with disk diffusion test findings. the clinical outcomes of the patients and their antimicrobial treatments were registered. results: the antimicrobial susceptibility of lactobacillus strains was species dependent. the  considerable number of lactobacillus rhamnosus (n=46), lactobacillus fermentum (n=12), and lactobacillus casei (n=12) strains available for testing made it possible to compare the susceptibilities within 1 species, as well. of the 46 l.  rhamnosus isolates, 22 were identified as l. rhamnosus gg type by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all lactobacillus isolates demonstrated low minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin. mics of vancomycin were high (>256 microg/ml) for  all other species except lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. disk diffusion and e-test results were concordant. the mics of cephalosporins varied;  cefuroxime demonstrated a higher level of activity than did ceftriaxone. benzylpenicillin and ampicillin mics had variable ranges between different species. combination therapy was given to 83% of the patients, but, in 54% of them, therapy included only 1 microbiologically active agent, according to results of the susceptibility tests. mortality at 1 week was 12% among patients who presumably were receiving adequate treatment and 27% among patients who were  receiving inadequate treatment (p=.131, by e-test). conclusion: most clinical lactobacillus blood isolates demonstrated low mics of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin, but they had variable susceptibility to penicillin and cephalosporins.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == the genome of the virulent phage lc-nu of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus, and  comparative genomics with lactobacillus casei phages.
AB  == the complete 36,466-bp genome sequence of the virulent phage lc-nu of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus was determined. the linear dsdna with a gc-content of 44.2% contained 3' single-stranded cohesive ends of 12 nucleotides. a total of 51 putative open reading frames (orfs) were predicted. lc-nu showed to be evolutionary closely related to the temperate lactobacillus casei phages phi at3  and a2. high dna homology with phi at3 was shared over the late transcribed genes, and the highest homology with a2 was within the genetic switch region. the truncated ci-like repressor was the only lysogeny related gene left, which strongly suggested lc-nu to be recently evolved from a temperate origin. three putative methylases and endonucleases were detected from the region of early-transcribed genes. the putative origin of replication within the putative gene orf34 homologous to replisome organizers resembled to that of lambdoid phages. the present study suggested lc-nu to be a new candidate for the proposed  sfi21-like species.

TI  == ribotyping of lactobacillus casei group strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  == a series of lactobacilli isolated from dairy products were characterized using biotyping and ribotyping with ecori and hindiii restriction enzymes. biotyping assigned 14 strains as lactobacillus casei, 6 strains as lactobacillus paracasei  subsp. paracasei and 12 as lactobacillus rhamnosus. the obtained ribotype patterns separated all analyzed strains into two clearly distinguished groups corresponding to l. rhamnosus and l. casei/l. paracasei subsp. paracasei. the hindiii ribotypes of individual strains representing these two groups were visually very similar. in contrast, ecori ribotyping revealed high intraspecies variability. all ribotypes of l. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei dairy strains were very close and some strains even shared identical ribotype profiles. the type strains l. casei ccm 7088t (= atcc 393t) and lactobacillus zeae ccm 7069t revealing similar ribopatterns formed a separate subcluster using both restriction enzymes. in contrast, the ribotype profile of l. casei ccm 7089 (= atcc 334) was very close to ribopatterns obtained from the dairy strains. these results support synonymy of l. casei and l. paracasei species revealed by other studies as well as reclassification of the type strain l. casei ccm 7088t as l. zeae and designation of l. casei ccm 7089 as the neotype strain.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.
AB  == six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion  of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the  antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == ph-, lactic acid-, and non-lactic acid-dependent activities of probiotic lactobacilli against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == the mechanism(s) underlying the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacillus strains appears to be multifactorial and includes lowering of the ph and the production of lactic acid and of antibacterial compounds, including bacteriocins  and nonbacteriocin, non-lactic acid molecules. addition of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium to the incubating medium delays the killing activity of lactic acid. we found that the probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii la1, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, and l. rhamnosus gr1 induced a dramatic decrease in the viability of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 mainly attributable to non-lactic acid molecule(s) present in the cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs). these molecules were more active against serovar typhimurium sl1344 in the exponential growth phase than in the stationary growth phase. we also showed  that the production of the non-lactic acid substance(s) responsible for the killing activity was dependent on growth temperature and that both unstable and stable substances with killing activity were present in the cfcss. we found that  the complete inhibition of serovar typhimurium sl1344 growth results from a ph-lowering effect.

AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

AB  == the sequence differences within the 16s rrna genes of lactobacillus casei/paracasei and related species, lactobacillus zeae and lactobacillus rhamnosus, were investigated. thirty-seven strains of mostly human or cheese origin were grouped by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of the total chromosomal dna and by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge) of pcr-amplified 16s rrna gene fragments. rea verified that all strains were genomically unique and singled out three major clusters, one l. rhamnosus-cluster and two clusters containing l. paracasei strains. the groups obtained by ttge corresponded with one exception to the rea-clusters. in the ttge clustering all l. paracasei strains formed one general group with one ttge-band in common, and this group was sub-divided into five subgroups due to the presence of more than one ttge-band in four of the subgroups. the occurrence of multiple ttge-bands was investigated by amplifying and cloning of the 16s rrna genes from the strains showing this phenomenon, thereby 12 clones from each strain were sequenced, demonstrating polymorphisms in almost all the cases. subjecting the clones displaying sequence variations to ttge as well as sequencing of 16s rdna revealed by ribotyping of the strains, verified the presence of polymorphisms within the 16s rrna genes. the migration characteristic of amplified dna from a single clone corresponded to a specific band in the ttge-pattern of the strain from which the  clone originated. southern blot hybridisation with a 16s rdna probe demonstrated  the presence of at least five 16s rrna genes in l. casei/paracasei. a higher degree of variable positions than previously reported was observed in the 16s rrna gene fragments of the members in the complex. sequence comparison between the 16s rrna gene copies of l. casei (ccug 21451t) and l. zeae (ccug 35515t) demonstrated that the two species shared almost the same sequence in some copies  while the others were more different. our results provide one explanation for the difficulties in reaching clear-cut taxa within the l. casei/paracasei complex.

AB  == the expected 4-week cure rate after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis are only 65-70%. in an attempt to improve the cure rate by adding probiotic lactobacilli we performed a double-blind placebo-controlled study of adjuvant lactobacilli treatment after an open treatment with vaginal clindamycin ovules. women with bacterial vaginosis as defined by amsel's criteria were treated with clindamycin ovules. vaginal smears were collected and analysed according to nugent's criteria. during the following menstruation period the women used, as an adjuvant treatment, either lactobacilli-prepared tampons or placebo tampons. the  lactobacilli tampons were loaded with a mixture of freeze-dried l. fermentum, l.  casei var. rhamnosus and l. gasseri. the cure rate was recorded after the second  menstruation period. there was no improvement in the cure rate after treatment with lactobacilli-containing tampons compared to placebo tampons; the cure rates  as defined by amsel's criteria were 56% and 62%, respectively, and 55% and 63%, as defined by nugent's criteria. this is the first study to report cure rates for women with 'intermediate' wet smear ratings according to nugent's classification  and this group had an overall cure rate of 44%. the cure rate of treatment of bacterial vaginosis was not improved by using lactobacilli-prepared tampons for one menstruation.

TI  == detection of antifungal properties in lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei sm20, sm29, and sm63 and molecular typing of the strains.
AB  == lactobacilli isolated from different food and feed samples such as raw milk, cheese, yoghurt, olives, sour dough, as well as corn and grass silage, were screened for their antifungal activities. out of 1,424 isolates tested, 82 were shown to be inhibitory to different yeasts (candida spp. and zygosaccharomyces bailii) and a penicillium sp., which were previously isolated from spoiled yoghurt and fruits. carbohydrate fermentation patterns suggested that a substantial portion, 25%, belonged to the lactobacillus casei group, including l. casei, l. paracasei, and l. rhamnosus. the isolates sm20 (dsm14514), sm29 (dsm14515), and sm63 (dsm14516) were classified by pcr using species-specific primers to target the corresponding type strains (l. casei, l. paracasei, and l.  rhamnosus) as controls. further molecular typing methods such as randomly amplified polymorphic dna, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene allowed classifying strains sm20, sm29, and sm63 as l. paracasei subsp. paracasei in accordance with the new reclassification of the  l. casei group proposed by collins et al.

TI  == succinate production and citrate catabolism by cheddar cheese nonstarter lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to identify strains of cheddar cheese nonstarter lactobacilli that synthesize succinate from common precursors and characterize the biochemical pathways utilized. methods and results: whole cell incubations of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus zeae and lactobacillus rhamnosus, were used to identify strains that accumulated succinate from citrate, l-lactate, aspartic acid or isocitrate. in vivo 13c-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  (13c-nmr) identified the biochemical pathway involved at ph 7.0, and under conditions more representative of the cheese ripening environment (ph 5.1/4% nacl/13 degrees c). enzyme assays on cell-free extracts were used to support the  pathway suggested by 13c-nmr. conclusions: the lact. plantarum strains studied synthesize succinate from citrate by the reductive tricarboxylic acid (tca) cycle at either ph 7.0 or ph 5.1/4% nacl/13 degrees c. lactobacillus casei, lact. zeae  and lact. rhamnosus strains lack one or more enzymatic activities present in this pathway, and do not accumulate succinate from any of the four precursors studied. significance and impact of the study: the addition of lact. plantarum strains to  milk during cheese manufacture may increase the accumulation of the flavour enhancer succinate.

TI  == pathogenic relevance of lactobacillus: a retrospective review of over 200 cases.
AB  == given that lactobacillus has been reported to be the causative pathogen in many types of infection despite debate regarding the organism's clinical significance, a literature review was conducted to investigate the treatments and outcomes of lactobacillus infections reported to date. in this article, the characteristics of over 200 reported cases of lactobacillus-associated infections are summarized. lactobacillus was found to be frequently associated with endocarditis and bacteremia. lactobacillus was also associated with a variety of other infections  including, but not limited to, peritonitis, abscesses, and meningitis. the species casei and rhamnosus were the most common. the isolates tended to be most  sensitive to erythromycin and clindamycin and most resistant to vancomycin. the species that was most sensitive to vancomycin was acidophilus. the overall mortality rate was nearly 30%. there was a significant association between mortality and polymicrobial infection (p=0.004). in the subset of patients with bacteremia, increased mortality was associated with inadequate treatment (p=0.001) and polymicrobial bacteremia (p=0.044).

TI  == rapid identification of probiotic lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16s rrna through 23s  rrna.
AB  == this study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic lactobacillus species such as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16s and 23s rrna  genes and their rrna intergenic spacer region of each species. it was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the  general biochemical methods. the phylogenetic analyses, using 16s rdna sequences  of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex pcr assay were trustworthy. taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven lactobacillus species.

TI  == lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus zeae isolates identified by sequence signature and immunoblot phenotype.
AB  == species taxonomy within the lactobacillus casei group of bacteria has been unsettled. with the goal of helping clarify the taxonomy of these bacteria, we investigated the first 3 variable regions of the 16s rrna gene, the 16s-23s rrna  interspacer region, and one third of the chaperonin 60 gene for lactobacillus isolates originally designated as l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, and l. zeae. for each genetic region, a phylogenetic tree was created and signature sequence analysis was done. as well, phenotypic analysis of the various strains was performed by immunoblotting. both sequence signature analysis and immunoblotting gave immediate identification of l. casei, l. rhamnosus, and l. zeae isolates. these results corroborate and extend previous findings concerning  these lactobacilli; therefore, we strongly endorse recent proposals for revised nomenclature. specifically, isolate atcc 393 is appropriately rejected as the l.  casei type strain because of grouping with isolates identified as l. zeae. as well, because all other l. casei isolates, including the proposed neotype isolate atcc 334, grouped together with isolates designated l. paracasei, we support the  use of the single species l. casei and rejection of the name l. paracasei.

TI  == joint effect of nitrogen sources and b vitamin supplementation of date juice on lactic acid production by lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus.
AB  == the use of date juice as a substrate for lactic acid production was investigated. various nitrogen sources were compared with yeast extract for efficient lactic acid production by lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus. among different nitrogen sources added to date juice (yeast extract, ammonium sulfate, tryptic soy, urea,  peptone, and casein hydrolysate), yeast extract was the most efficient. the effect of yeast extract could have been due to its b vitamin content. the addition of five b vitamins at less than 25 mg/l to date juice with any nitrogen  source enhanced lactic acid production to some extent, except for date juice with yeast extract or urea or peptone. the most significant increase was obtained with ammonium sulfate. half of the yeast extract content (10 g/l) in a supplemented date juice could be replaced by a mixture of b vitamins at less than 25 mg/l, and ammonium sulfate at 2.6 g/l with no significant decrease in lactic acid production.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

TI  == adjunct starter properties affect characteristic features of swiss-type cheeses.
AB  == a large number of microorganisms, both starter microorganisms and non-starter lactic acid bacteria originating from the base milk, or from various contamination sources during cheese manufacture, is associated with cheese ripening and the formation of flavour, texture and aroma. under controlled conditions, emmental and bergkase, a gruyere-type cheese variety, were produced from pasteurised milk with standard starters and defined strains of facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli (fhl), and partly with addition of a defined mixture of enterococci. lactobacillus casei subsp. casei and l. rhamnosus (two strains each) were selected with respect to their potential for the utilisation of citric acid and ribose as sole energy source. the fhl developed up to 10(8) cfu/g within the first weeks of ripening, and viable counts in mature cheeses were 10(7) cfu/g, independent of the cheese variety. bergkase made with addition  of l. rhamnosus strains showed a more pronounced proteolysis, resulting in reduced firmness and elasticity values of the cheese body, and fhl strains able to utilise citric acid improved the appearance of the cheeses by increasing the number of small eyes to the desired level. in emmental cheese, the citric acid (+) strains reduced the intensity of propionic acid formation as the fhl apparently competed with the propionibacteria, and enterococci disappeared completely during maturation. although further work is needed the study shows that, depending on the cheese variety, particular properties of fhl adjunct starters significantly affect important quality attributes of the resulting cheeses.

TI  == two distinct pathways for the formation of hydroxy fa from linoleic acid by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == identification and characterization of a conserved nuclease secreted by strains of the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == aims: nuclease secretion was evaluated for five species of lactobacillus and the  activity was characterized in terms of thermal resistance, molecular weight and mode of action on plasmid dna. methods and results: assays of nuclease from l. rhamnosus atcc 9595 on dna of different origins indicates a broad activity spectrum. secreted nuclease from this strain resists a thermal treatment of 20 min at 100 degrees c, is not sensitive to a treatment for disruption of disulphide bonds nor to edta treatment under 10 mm l(-1). nuclease production is  not growth linked and seems to be constitutive. extracellular nuclease of l. rhamnosus atcc 9595 introduces a single-stranded nick in supercoiled dna, thus potentially reducing the transformability of plasmid dna. in seven of eight tested strains, sds-page revealed a major protein with a molecular weight of ca 35 kda. minor degradation products also showed nuclease activity. conclusions: a  comparative analysis of the extracellular fractions of 14 different lactobacillus strains indicate that nuclease secretion seems to be a widely distributed function among species of milk-related lactobacilli. the production of secreted nuclease may contribute to the low ability of lactobacillus spp. to be transformed and maintain exogenous dna. significance and impact of the study: determination of the characteristics and distribution of nuclease activity contribute to developing strategies to overcome this barrier to efficient transformation of milk lactobacilli.

AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  == there are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. in this study, lactobacillus strains (l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri,  l. casei and l. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic  escherichia coli (ehec) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, c2bbe1.  while the adhesion and colonization of ehec was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of ehec into the cell line was  markedly suppressed by l. rhamnosus, though not by others. concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of ehec and host cell were not affected by the presence of l. rhamnosus. simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on ehec internalization was strictly dependent on viable l. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed l. rhamnosus. the fact that l. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between l. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of ehec.

TI  == resistance of lactobacillus casei in plastic-composite-support biofilm reactors during liquid membrane extraction and optimization of the lactic acid extraction  system.
AB  == lactic acid fermentations were performed with plastic-composite-support (pcs) disks in solvent-saturated media with lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus (atcc  11443). the pcs disks contained 50% (w/w) polypropylene, 35% (w/w) ground soybean hulls, 5% (w/w) yeast extract, 5% (w/w) soybean flour, and 5% (w/w) bovine albumin. bioassays were performed by growing l. casei in solvent-saturated media  after soaking the pcs disks. eighteen different solvent and carrier combinations  were evaluated. overall, l. casei biofilm fermentation demonstrated the same lactic acid production in solvent-saturated medium as suspended cells in medium without solvents (control). to evaluate pcs solvent-detoxifying properties, two bioassays were developed. when solvent-saturated medium in consecutive equal volumes (10 ml then 10 ml) was exposed to pcs, both media demonstrated lactic acid fermentation equal to the control. however, when solvent-saturated medium with two consecutive unequal volumes (10 ml then 90 ml) was exposed to pcs, some  degree of toxicity was observed. furthermore, iso-octane, tributylphosphate (tbp), and span 80 were optimized for recovery as 91%, 5%, and 4% (v/v), respectively, with a 1:1 ratio of 1.2 m na(2)co(3) stripping solution. also, recovery by emulsion liquid extraction in the hollow-fiber contactor was minimal  due to low recovery at ph 5.0 and incompatibility of the solvent and hollow-fiber material. these results suggest that pcs biofilm reactors can benefit lactic acid fermentation by eliminating the toxic effect from solvent leakage into the fermentation medium from liquid-liquid extractive integrated fermentations.

TI  == consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers for amplification of priming  glycosyltransferase genes of the exopolysaccharide locus in strains of the lactobacillus casei group.
AB  == a primer design strategy named codehop (consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer) for amplification of distantly related sequences was used to detect the priming glycosyltransferase (gt) gene in strains of the lactobacillus casei group. each hybrid primer consisted of a short 3' degenerate  core based on four highly conserved amino acids and a longer 5' consensus clamp region based on six sequences of the priming gt gene products from exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing bacteria. the hybrid primers were used to detect the priming gt gene of 44 commercial isolates and reference strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l. casei, lactobacillus zeae, and streptococcus thermophilus. the priming gt gene was detected in the genome of both non-eps-producing (eps(-)) and eps-producing (eps(+)) strains of l. rhamnosus. the sequences of the cloned pcr products were similar to those of the priming gt  gene of various gram-negative and gram-positive eps(+) bacteria. specific primers designed from the l. rhamnosus rw-9595m gt gene were used to sequence the end of  the priming gt gene in selected eps(+) strains of l. rhamnosus. phylogenetic analysis revealed that lactobacillus spp. form a distinctive group apart from other lactic acid bacteria for which gt genes have been characterized to date. moreover, the sequences show a divergence existing among strains of l. rhamnosus  with respect to the terminal region of the priming gt gene. thus, the pcr approach with consensus-degenerate hybrid primers designed with codehop is a practical approach for the detection of similar genes containing conserved motifs in different bacterial genomes.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

AB  == emerging from the stigma of once being referred to as "snake oil", excellent scientific and clinical evidence now exists to indicate that probiotics do indeed have a role to play in medicine. the proper definition of probiotics is important "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health  benefit on the host", for several reasons. it rules out so-called probiotics that have no clinically proven, peer-reviewed data, and it states the need to have viable bacteria present, unlike these pseudo products which are often wrongly labeled, poorly manufactured, with low or no viability at time of use. guidelines, prepared by the united nations and world health organization are now  available to guide physicians and consumers as to the types of strains with documented benefits. in urology, the most studied strains are lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum b-54 and rc-14. their use daily in oral form, or  once to three times weekly as a vaginal suppository, have been shown to reduce the urogenital pathogen load and the risk of urinary tract and vaginal infections. organisms such as oxalobacter formigenes, still in the r&d phase, offer great potential to reduce kidney stone formation via oxalate degradation in the intestine. some studies using l. casei shirota suggest a possible effect against bladder cancer, while studies using l. plantarum 299 show significantly reduced infection rates in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. in short, specific probiotic strains hold much promise for use in the urology setting.

TI  == persistence of colonization of intestinal mucosa by a probiotic strain, lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus lcr35, after oral consumption.
AB  == the colonization by the probiotic lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus lcr35 of the gastrointestinal tracts of mice and humans was studied. the mice were orally  given 10(9) cfu of lcr35 either once or three times at 24-h intervals. a 16s ribosomal nucleic probe used in hybridization assays detected lcr35 in the feces  of mice for up to 3 days after the feeding, at a level of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu/g of feces. in the human assay, 12 healthy volunteers were enrolled in a randomized trial and ingested lcr35 at a dosage of 10(8) or 10(10) or 10(12) cfu every day for 7 days. then, after a 3-week posttreatment period, there was a second intake  period similar to the first one. analysis of fecal samples showed significant increases in the number of lactobacilli during the first intake period, whatever  the dose given. the greatest increases were observed in subjects harboring the lowest indigenous population of lcr35-like bacteria. during the 3-week posttreatment period, the number of cfu slightly decreased over time, and an increase, although not a statistically significant one, was observed during the second test period. these findings suggest that lcr35 is able to survive within the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy products inhibit genotoxic effect of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in sos-chromotest.
AB  == antigenotoxic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from commercial dairy products was studied using sos-chromotest. the supernatants from bacteria-genotoxin co-incubations in general exhibited a strong suppression on sos-induction produced by 4-nqo on the  tester organism escherichia coli pq37 (sfia::lacz). high genotoxicity inhibition  (>75%) was found for 31/67 of the examined bacteria and the maximum values of some strains within the species were as follows: lactobacillus casei, 99.1%; l. plantarum, 93.3%; l. rhamnosus, 93.4%; l. acidophilus, 90.9%; l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, 85.7% and bifidobacterium bifidum, 89.6%; strains with low antigenotoxicity (5-60%) were evidenced in both l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, whereas some inactive strains were found only in l. casei and  l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. cell exposure to 100 degrees c for 15 min prevented antigenotoxicity and no effect was evidenced for cell-free spent media. the active strains survived at 0.1 mm 4-nqo exposure and generally presented some relevant functional properties, such as tolerance to bile (0.5%) or acid environment (ph 2.0) and adherence to caco-2 enterocytes. antigenotoxicity was always associated with modification of the 4-nqo absorbance profile.

TI  == food-grade host/vector expression system for lactobacillus casei based on complementation of plasmid-associated phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg.
AB  == a new food-grade host/vector system for lactobacillus casei based on lactose selection was constructed. the wild-type non-starter host lb. casei strain e utilizes lactose via a plasmid-encoded phosphotransferase system. for food-grade  cloning, a stable lactose-deficient mutant was constructed by deleting a 141-bp fragment from the phospho-beta-galactosidase gene lacg via gene replacement. the  deletion resulted in an inactive phospho-beta-galactosidase enzyme with an internal in-frame deletion of 47 amino acids. a complementation plasmid was constructed containing a replicon from lactococcus lactis, the lacg gene from lb. casei, and the constitutive promoter of pepr for lacg expression from lb. rhamnosus. the expression of the lacg gene from the resulting food-grade plasmid  pleb600 restored the ability of the lactose-negative mutant strain to grow on lactose to the wild-type level. the vector pleb600 was used for expression of the proline iminopeptidase gene pepi from lb. helveticus in lb. casei. the results show that the food-grade expression system reported in this paper can be used for expression of foreign genes in lb. casei.

TI  == assessment of safety of lactobacillus strains based on resistance to host innate  defense mechanisms.
AB  == seven lactobacillus strains belonging to four species were evaluated for pathogenicity as well as for in vitro sensitivity to the bactericidal mechanisms  of macrophages in a rabbit infective endocarditis (ie) model. two bacteremia-associated strains, l. rhamnosus phls a103/70 and l. casei phls a357/84, as well as the l. rhamnosus type strain and the probiotic l. rhamnosus strain atcc 53103, showed moderate infectivity, and the virulence of the probiotic l. casei strain shirota and type strains such as l. acidophilus atcc 4356(t) and l. gasseri dsm 20243(t) in the model was negligible. the strains that showed pathogenic potential in the rabbit ie model (phls a357/84, phls a103/70, and atcc 53103) were more resistant than strain shirota to intracellular killing  activity by mouse macrophages in vitro and also to bactericidal nitrogen intermediates, such as nitric oxide and no(2)(-) ions. these results suggest that resistance to host innate defense systems, which would function at inflammatory lesions, should be considered in the safety assessment of lactobacillus strains.

TI  == probiotics and helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  == the need for new strategies for helicobacter pylori eradication, alternative or complementary to antibiotic therapy, has recently claimed the attention of many investigators. pre-clinical studies have shown the inhibition of helicobacter pylori growth by lactobacilli and the anti-helicobacter pylori action of lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus strains, possibly due to the production of lactic acid or to the secretion of an autolysin. clinical studies have demonstrated a persistent reduction in delta over baseline values at the 13c urea breath test independently of omeprazole administration with lactobacillus acidophilus la1, the eradication  in 6 out of 14 patients with lactobacillus acidophilus alone, positive results in patients in which a standard helicobacter pylori triple therapy was randomly supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus.

TI  == lactobacillus species is more cytotoxic to human bladder cancer cells than mycobacterium bovis (bacillus calmette-guerin).
AB  == purpose: we determined if lactobacillus species has growth inhibitory effects in  human bladder cancer cell lines and how this effect compares with the known effects of mycobacterium bovis, that is bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg). materials and methods: the growth of mgh and rt112 cells were determined by cell counts after 24, 48 and 72 hours of exposure to l. casei strain shirota (yakult, singapore) or l. rhamnosus strain gg (national collection of industrial and marine bacteria, ltd., aberdeen, scotland) (1 x 10 and 1 x 10 cfu) or bcg (1 x 10 cfu) in the presence and absence of streptomycin. annexin-v was used to monitor the presence of pre-apoptotic cells. results: l. rhamnosus gg inhibited mgh proliferation and it was cytotoxic to rt112 cells (p <0.05). l. casei shirota was cytotoxic to the 2 cell lines (p <0.05). bcg had a similar cytotoxic effect in mgh cells as lactobacillus species but was not as effective in rt112 cells. streptomycin abrogated the cytotoxic effect of lactobacillus species but not that of bcg. cytotoxic activity was not found in lactobacilli culture supernates but it was induced in the presence of mammalian cells. l. rhamnosus gg induced apoptosis in rt112 but not in mgh cells. no apoptotic cells were detected after treatment with l. casei shirota. conclusions: lactobacillus species induced cytotoxic effects in bladder cancer cells. unlike bcg, it requires bacterial protein synthesis. like bcg, l. casei shirota induces cell death primarily via necrosis. the cytoxicity of these lactobacilli in bladder cancer cells raises the possibility of using this species of bacteria as intravesical agents for treating bladder cancer.

TI  == screening and selection of lactobacillus strains for use as adjunct cultures in production of semi-hard cheese.
AB  == thirty-three lactobacillus strains were tested as adjuncts in a cheese model system. eighteen strains originated from cheese (nine lactobacillus spp. and nine lb. paracasei/casei) and 15 from human intestinal mucosa (11 lb. rhamnosus; three lb. paracasei; one lb. plantarum). model cheeses weighing 120 g were made of cheese grains from full-scale production of washed curd semi-hard cheese (herrgard). the model system was reproducible and similar to full-scale production with respect to moisture, salt content, ph and microbial flora. the model cheeses were sampled for aerobic and anaerobic plate count and viable counts of lactobacillus and lactococcus. the presence of adjuncts in the model cheeses was confirmed by typing isolates with randomly amplified polymorphic dna  (rapd). the sensory properties of model cheeses were described. in a first trial  23 of the 33 adjuncts were re-isolated from the corresponding model cheeses after 9 or 13 weeks. adjuncts of lb. paracasei were re-isolated more frequently than adjuncts of lb. rhamnosus. nine strains were selected, on the basis of their ability to grow and be a dominating part of the microflora of model cheese with interesting sensory properties. these strains were further studied together with  two commercial cultures. the sensory influences on model cheeses of six of the adjuncts were confirmed, and flavour scores were in the range of 2.9-7.1 for model cheeses with different adjuncts while the control had a flavour score of 5.6 (0-10 scale). survival and growth of seven out of the nine strains correlated with the results of the first trial. growth and influence on flavour of four adjunct cultures were confirmed in experimental cheese manufactured in a 400-1 open vat.

TI  == the evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

TI  == competition for adhesion between probiotics and human gastrointestinal pathogens  in the presence of carbohydrate.
AB  == the adhesion of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg to human enterocyte-like caco-2 cells  was not inhibited by eight carbohydrates tested, namely n-acetyl-glucosamine, galactose, glucose, fructose, fucose, mannose, methyl-alpha-d-mannopyranoside and sucrose. the degree of hydrophobicity predicted the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg to caco-2 cells. l. rhamnosus gg, however, was able to compete with escherichia coli and salmonella spp. of low hydrophobicity and high adhesin-receptor interaction for adhesion to caco-2 cells. the interference of adhesion of these gastrointestinal (gi) bacteria by l. rhamnosus gg was probably through steric hindrance, and the degree of inhibition was related to the distribution of the adhesin receptors and hydrophobins on the caco-2 surface. a carbohydrate index for adhesion (cia) was used to depict the binding property of adhesins on bacteria surfaces. cia was defined as the sum of the fraction of adhesion in the  presence of carbohydrates, with reference to the adhesion measured in the absence of any carbohydrate. the degree of competition for receptor sites between lactobacillus casei shirota and gi bacteria is a function of their cia distance.  there were at least two types of adhesins on the surface of l. casei shirota. the study provides a scientific basis for the screening and selection of probiotics that compete with selective groups of pathogens for adhesion to intestinal surfaces. it also provides a model for the characterisation of adhesins and adhesin-receptor interactions.

TI  == isolation, identification and changes in the composition of lactic acid bacteria  during the malting of two different barley cultivars.
AB  == malt has a complex microbial population, which changes as the malting process commences. little is known about the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria (lab)  in each of the malting phases. in this study, we determined the number of lab present in the different phases of malting with clipper and prisma barley cultivars. the strains were identified to species level by using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, rapd-pcr banding patterns and 16s rrna sequencing. the number of viable lab in the barley before steep was higher in prisma than clipper (7.6 x 10(4) and 1.2 x 10(3) cfu/g, respectively).  despite this, the number of viable cells recorded in the first steep water was slightly higher for clipper (9.0 x 10(5) cfu/g) than prisma (5.5 x 10(5) cfu/g).  more or less, the same cell numbers were recorded for the two barley cultivars after the first and second dry stands. both cultivars displayed more or less the  same cell numbers (3.7 x 10(7) for clipper and 3.2 x 10(7) cfu/g for prisma) after the third day of germination. however, a higher number of lab were detected in the kilned prisma malt (6.9 x 10(4) cfu/g) than the clipper malt (1.5 x 10(4)  cfu/g). leuconostoc argentinum, le. lactis and weissella confusa were the most predominant in both cultivars. a few strains were identified as w. paramesenteroides (four strains), lactobacillus casei (five strains), lactococcus lactis (five strains) and lb. rhamnosus (two strains). lb. casei and lb. rhamnosus were not isolated from the prisma cultivar, while w. paramesenteroides  and lc. lactis were absent in the clipper cultivar. kilned malt of the clipper cultivar contained predominantly le. argentinum, whereas the prisma cultivar contained mainly lc. lactis. to our knowledge. this is the first report of lab in clipper and prisma barley and the various malting phases. the influence of the various groups of lactic acid bacteria on the fermenting ability of brewers' yeast is currently being determined.

TI  == reduction of sulfide, ammonia compounds, and adhesion properties of lactobacillus casei strain ke99 in vitro.
AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei strain ke99 to reduce sulfide, ammonia, and to adhere to bio-surfaces was characterized and compared with three lactobacillus reference strains. sulfide reduction by strain ke99 in mrs broth increased exponentially after 10-h growth and reached a maximum (>300 ppm reduction) within 48 h. ke99 demonstrated a maximum reduction of sulfide under anaerobic (341 ppm)  growth conditions at ph 6.0-8.0 range. maximum anaerobic reduction of sulfide was demonstrated by l. casei 393 at ph 7.0 (272 ppm); l. rhamnosus at ph 8.0 (277 ppm); and l. reuteri at ph 7.0 (244 ppm). ke99 reduced sulfide more (p < 0.0001)  in mrs broth spiked with na2s (374 ppm) than (nh4)2s (340 ppm) salts. ammonia reduction by strain ke99 and the three lactobacillus reference strains in mrs broth was low. ammonia reduction reached a maximum within 36 h and remained unchanged over extended incubations of 48 h to 72 h or further. ke99 reduced ammonium sulfate (37 ppm) more readily than the nitrate (31 ppm), hypophosphate (29 ppm), or chloride (20 ppm) salts of ammonia. ke99 and the three reference strains of lactobacilli demonstrated avid binding to bio-coat (cn type-i, cn type-iv, laminin, fibronectin), matrigel, and caco-2 cell monolayers in vitro. the number of lactobacilli binding to caco-2 was estimated at 74/cell with strain ke99, which was significantly higher compared with 40/cell (p < 0.0001), 26/cell  (0.0001), and 64/cell (p < 0.002) with l. casei 393, l. reuteri, and l. rhamnosus, respectively. the interaction of ke99 to immobilized cn type-i was saturable and reached an equilibrium within 1 h at room temperature. ke99 binding to cn type-i occurred at a wide ph range and was biphasic with maximum binding at ph 5.5 and 7.5. inhibition and binding-displacement experiments with different salts and sugars suggested that the ke99 binding to immobilized cn type-i may involve a combination of electrostatic and lectin-type interactions. ke99 effectively detached the cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 in the range of 55% (atcc43895) to 76% (atcc43894). the binding-displacement values for l. casei 393, l. reuteri and l. rhamnosus to detach cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 (atcc43894) were 66 +/- 4%, 59 +/- 2%, and 64 +/- 2%, respectively. also, a reconstituted solution of the freeze-dried ke99 preparation effectively detached the cn-adherent e. coli o157:h7 in a dose-dependent manner that reached a binding-displacement equilibrium of 85% at a 1% wt/vol ke99 concentration.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

AB  == conditions for protoplast regeneration were examined for several strains of homofermentative lactobacilli and pediococci isolated from silage. attempts to regenerate protoplasts using previously published agar regeneration media for lactobacilli were unsuccessful for most of the strains. replacing or increasing colloidal substances in a medium containing raffinose and mgcl(2) as osmotic stabilizers enabled efficient regeneration of the protoplasts at a frequency of 10-99%. a medium containing gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp) and no agar was effective for lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus rhamnosus protoplasts. an agar medium containing pvp (pvp medium) was effective for pediococcus sp. protoplasts, and addition of agarose to the pvp medium enabled regeneration of lactobacillus casei protoplasts. a medium containing calcium alginate gel and no agar was effective for lactobacillus curvatus protoplasts. the type of colloidal substance required for protoplast regeneration varied from species to species. this result suggested that several kinds of media may be necessary to regenerate protoplasts for all the genera of lactobacilli and pediococci.

AB  == an immobilized-cell biofilm reactor was used for the continuous production of lactic acid by lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus (atcc 11443). at iowa state university, a unique plastic composite support (pcs) that stimulates biofilm formation has been developed. the optimized pcs blend for lactobacillus contains  50% (wt/wt) agricultural products [35% (wt/wt) ground soy hulls, 5% (wt/wt) soy flour, 5% (wt/wt) yeast extract, 5% (wt/wt) dried bovine albumin, and mineral salts] and 50% (wt/wt) polypropylene (pp) produced by high-temperature extrusion. the pcs tubes have a wall thickness of 3.5 mm, outer diameter of 10.5 mm, and were cut into 10-cm lengths. six pcs tubes, three rows of two parallel tubes, were bound in a grid fashion to the agitator shaft of a 1.2-1 vessel for a new brunswick bioflo 3000 fermentor. pcs stimulates biofilm formation, supplies nutrients to attached and suspended cells, and increases lactic acid production.  biofilm thickness on the pcs tubes was controlled by the agitation speed. the pcs biofilm reactor and pp control reactor achieved optimal average production rates  of 9.0 and 5.8 g l(-1) h(-1), respectively, at 0.4 h(-1) dilution rate and 125-rpm agitation with yields of approximately 70%.

TI  == quality control lactobacillus strains for use with the api 50ch and api zym systems at 37 degrees c.
AB  == the api 50ch and api zym systems fulfil an important role in the polyphasic taxonomic identification of lactobacilli. when the api 50ch fermentation profile  of the quality control lactobacillus casei var. alactosus (lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) strain ncfb 206 was determined at 37 degrees c, it was found to differ from that determined at 30 degrees c by biomereiux sa (montalieu vercieu, france) and the national collection of food bacteria (aberdeen, scotland). in addition, the api 50ch fermentation and api zym profiles of lb. casei strain atcc 334t determined at 37 degrees c differed from those determined at 30 degrees c by lee  and simard (1984). strains ncfb 206 and atcc 334t were thus assumed to exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile, a phenomenon recently described by nigatu et al. (2000). in contrast, lb. rhamnosus strain atcc 243t did not exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile. moreover, the fermentation profile obtained at 37 degrees c differed in only one  respect (positive beta-gentiobiose utilisation) from that published by collins et al. (1989). in addition, lactobacillus strain gg produced a stable and reproducible api zym profile at 37 degrees c, although some variation in the level of enzyme activity was evident. thus, strain ncfb 206 was replaced by strain atcc 243t as the quality control strain of choice for use with the api 50ch fermentation system, and lactobacillus strain gg adopted for use as a quality control strain with the api zym system for strain identification of lactobacilli at 37 degrees c. the api 50ch and api zym profiles of the commercially important lactobacillus strains ncfb 1748, gg, kld, f19, and aca-dc  212.3 were determined at 37 degrees c after anaerobic growth in mrs broth. the fermentation and enzyme profiles of strain ncfb 1748 were almost identical to those of lb. crispatus atcc 33820t, those of strain gg were found to be more similar to those of lb. rhamnosus strain 243t than lb. zeae strain atcc 15820t, those of strain kld were most similar to those of lb. fermentum dsm 20052t, while those of strains f19 and aca-dc 212.3 were similar to those of lb. casei strain atcc 334t.

TI  == characterization of the properties of human- and dairy-derived probiotics for prevention of infectious diseases in fish.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the potential probiotic properties of six  lactic acid bacteria (lab) intended for human use, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. rhamnosus lc 705, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, and lactobacillus johnsonii la1, and one for animal use, enterococcus faecium tehobak, for use as a fish probiotic. the strains for human use were specifically chosen since they are known to be safe for human use, which is of major importance because the fish are meant for human  consumption. the selection was carried out by five different methods: mucosal adhesion, mucosal penetration, inhibition of pathogen growth and adhesion, and resistance to fish bile. the adhesion abilities of the seven lab and three fish pathogens, vibrio anguillarum, aeromonas salmonicida, and flavobacterium psychrophilum, were determined to mucus from five different sites on the surface  or in the gut of rainbow trout. five of the tested lab strains showed considerable adhesion to different fish mucus types (14 to 26% of the added bacteria). despite their adhesive character, the lab strains were not able to inhibit the mucus binding of a. salmonicida. coculture experiments showed significant inhibition of growth of a. salmonicida, which was mediated by competition for nutrients rather than secretion of inhibitory substances by the probiotic bacteria as measured in spent culture liquid. all lab except l. casei shirota showed tolerance against fish bile. l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus were found to penetrate fish mucus better than other probiotic bacteria. based on bile resistance, mucus adhesion, mucus penetration, and suppression of fish pathogen growth, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus can be considered for future in vivo challenge studies in fish as a novel and safe treatment in aquaculture.

AB  == production of lactic acid from date juice by fermentation has been studied using  lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus as the producer organism. the optimum substrate concentration, expressed in its glucose content, was 60 g l(-1). various nitrogen sources were compared with yeast extract in terms of their efficiency for lactic acid production. none of these nitrogen sources gave lactic acid concentrations as high as that obtained with yeast extract. as yeast extract supplementation was not economically attractive, different proportions of (nh4)2so4 and yeast extract were used. when the elemental nitrogen ratio of(nh4)2so4 to yeast extract was 4:1, the substrate use and efficiency of lactic  acid production were the same as in date juice supplemented with 20 g l(-1) yeast extract (0:5).

TI  == characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria from italian ewe cheeses based on phenotypic, genotypic, and cell wall protein analyses.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == identification of salivary lactobacillus rhamnosus species by dna profiling and a specific probe.
AB  == the lactobacillus genus has been shown to be associated with the dental carious process, but little is known about the species related to the decay, although lactobacillus rhamnosus is suspected to be the most implicated species. conventional identification methods based on biochemical criteria lead to ambiguous results, since the lactobacillus species found in saliva are phenotypically close. to clarify the role of this genus in the evolution of carious disease, this work aimed to find a rapid and reliable method for identifying the l. rhamnosus species. methods based on hybridization with dna probes and dna amplification by pcr were used. the dominant salivary lactobacillus species (reference strains from the atcc) were selected for this purpose as well as some wild strains isolated from children's saliva. dna profiling using semirandom polymorphic dna amplification (semi-rapd) generated specific patterns for l. rhamnosus atcc 7469. the profiles of all l. rhamnosus strains tested were similar and could be grouped; these strains shared four common fragments. wild strains first identified with classic methods shared common patterns with the l. rhamnosus species and could be reclassified. one fragment of the profile was purified, cloned, used as a probe and found to be specific to the l. rhamnosus species. these results may help to localize this species within its ecological niche and to elucidate the progression of the carious process.

AB  == aims: to develop a tool for rapid and inexpensive identification of the lactobacillus casei complex. methods and results: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus zeae and lactobacillus rhamnosus were identified by pcr-amplification of the segment between the u1 and u2 regions of 16s rdna (position 8-357, escherichia coli numbering) and temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (ttge). seven tested lact. paracasei strains were divided into three ttge-subgroups. conclusion: ttge successfully distinguished between the closely-related target species. ttge is also a powerful method for revealing sequence heterogeneities in the 16s rrna genes. significance and impact of the study: due to rapid and easy performance, ttge of pcr-amplified 16s rdna fragments will be useful for the identification of extended numbers of isolates.

TI  == weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus) bacteremia: a case report.
AB  == infection with lactobacillus is rare, and only a handful of species have been identified as being clinically significant: lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus leichmannii. the literature contains one case report of bacteremia caused by weissella confusa (basonym: lactobacillus confusus), but  the clinical significance of the infection was unclear. we describe a case of w.  confusa bacteremia in a 46-year-old man with a history of abdominal aortic dissection and repair. this procedure was complicated by gut ischemia, which necessitated massive small bowel resection. he subsequently developed short-bowel syndrome, which required him to have total parenteral nutrition. he later developed an enterococcus faecalis aortic valve endocarditis that required a coronary artery bypass graft and aortic root replacement with homograft and 6 weeks of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin. three months prior to his most recent admission, he was diagnosed with klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia and candidemia. at the present admission, he had fever (t(max), 39.5 degrees c) and chills of 2 days' duration and was admitted to the intensive care unit because of hemodynamic instability. blood cultures grew k. pneumoniae and w. confusa in four of four blood culture bottles (both aerobe and anaerobe bottles). imaging studies failed to find any foci of infection. a transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no vegetations. a culture of the patient's hickman catheter tip was negative. the patient was treated with piperacillin-tazobactam and gentamicin. his condition improved, and he was discharged home, where he completed 4 weeks of piperacillin-tazobactam therapy. lactobacillemia seldom results in mortality; however, it may be a marker of a serious underlying disease. it is usually seen in patients who have a complex medical history or in patients who receive multiple antibiotics. lactobacillus spp. are generally associated with polymicrobial infections, and when isolated from the blood, they need to be considered possible pathogens. the presence of a vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive coccobacilli on a blood culture should alert clinicians to the possibility of bacteremia caused by w. confusa or other small gram-positive rods.

TI  == adherence of probiotic bacteria to human intestinal mucus in healthy infants and  during rotavirus infection.
AB  == the concentration of fecal mucin and the adhesion of specific probiotics and their combinations in the intestinal mucus of infants during and after rotavirus  diarrhea and in healthy children were determined. mucus was prepared from fecal samples from 20 infants during and after rotavirus diarrhea and from 10 healthy age-matched children. mucin concentration was determined, and the adhesion of five probiotics-lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus paracasei f19, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, and bifidobacterium lactis bb12-and their combinations was tested in vitro. the mean concentrations of fecal mucin during and after rotavirus diarrhea, 15.2 and 14.1 mg/g, were comparable to that in healthy children, 14.9 mg/g. the adherence of probiotics ranged from 1 to 34% in healthy subjects as indicated for the following strains:  l. rhamnosus gg, 34%; b. lactis bb12, 31%; l. acidophilus la5, 4%; l. paracasei f19, 3%; and l. casei shirota, 1% (p = 0.0001). the distinctive pattern of probiotic adherence was not influenced by rotavirus diarrhea. the adhesion of bb12 in the presence of gg increased from 31 to 39% in healthy infants (p = 0.018) and in episodes of diarrhea increased from 26 to 44% (p = 0.001). rotavirus diarrhea does not decrease the production of fecal mucin or with respect to the adhesion of probiotic bacteria tested in vitro. combination of specific probiotic strains may enhance adherence in a synergistic manner. optimal clinical application of these interactions may offer novel therapeutic guidelines for the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal infections.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogenic biofilm growth on silicone rubber in human urine by lactobacilli--a teleologic approach.
AB  == the ability of three lactobacillus strains to inhibit the adhesion and growth of  naturally occurring uropathogens on silicone rubber was investigated in human urine. the importance of biosurfactant production by lactobacillus in discouraging uropathogen growth was determined in relation to the binding affinities of the lactobacilli for silicone rubber. l. fermentum b54 markedly inhibited uropathogen growth on the silicone rubber disks after 8 days for all five men included in the study, albeit to various extents ranging from 77% to 100%. in urine from women, however, this inhibition was less clear, as it was absent for two of the four women participating in this study. l. casei rhamnosus  36 completely discouraged uropathogen growth on the disks after 8 days for three  of the four women, whereas its effect in urine from men was less pronounced (inhibition ranged from 48% to 100% and was absent for one man). l. casei rhamnosus atcc 7469t was the least inhibitory lactobacillus strain tested and inhibition was absent for a number of both male and female participants, possibly as a result of the low binding affinity of this strain for silicone rubber and of its inability to release biosurfactants. we conclude that the inhibition of uropathogen growth is dependent on the lactobacillus strain involved, and for l.  fermentum b54 it was demonstrated to be sex-related. hence, inhibition must be considered a multifactorial process.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

AB  == aim: the study was carried out to assess the agreement of api 50 ch fermentation  data of food lactobacilli with their rapd profiles to determine whether the system could be used alone as a reliable taxonomic tool for this genus. methods and results: api 50 ch, rapd and dna:dna reassociation data for 42 lactobacilli from tef and kocho were compared with 30 type strains. discrepancies were observed between the three methods in assigning strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lact. fermentum, weissella minor and lact. gallinarum, and lact. fermentum, lact. amylophilus, lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lact. rhamnosus. dna reassociation data agreed well with rapd results. conclusions: api 50 ch profiles should be complemented with molecular genetic results for effective identification in lactobacillus. significance and impact of the study:  the study suggested less dependability of metabolic data alone as an identification tool.

TI  == changes in the cultivable flora in deep carious lesions following a stepwise excavation procedure.
AB  == this study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. the final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a ca(oh)(2) compound and temporary sealing. reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. after anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. before temporary  restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. before the final excavation, which did  not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by a. naeslundii and various streptococci. in conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.

TI  == quantitative approach in the study of adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to intestinal cells and their competition with enterobacteria.
AB  == to describe the phenomena of bacterial adhesion to intestinal cells and the competition for adhesion between bacteria, mathematical equations based on a simple dissociation process involving a finite number of bacterial receptors on intestinal cell surface were developed. the equations allow the estimation of the maximum number of lactobacillus sp. and escherichia coli cells that can adhere to caco-2 cells and intestinal mucus; they also characterize the affinity of the bacteria to caco-2 cells and intestinal and fecal mucus and the theoretical adhesion ratio of two bacteria present in a mixed suspension. the competition for adhesion between lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and e. coli tg1 appeared to follow the proposed kinetics, whereas the competition between lactobacillus casei shirota and e. coli tg1 may involve multiple adhesion sites or a soluble factor in the culture medium of the former. the displacement of the adhered lactobacillus by e. coli tg1 seemed to be a rapid process, whereas the displacement of e. coli tg1 by the lactobacillus took more than an hour.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == phage-related dna polymorphism in dairy and probiotic lactobacillus.
AB  == various dna-based methods are presently being applied for identification of industrial bacterial cultures including dairy starter and probiotic strains of lactobacillus. the success of strain-specific identification depends on the power of the dna-based methods to reveal intraspecies dna polymorphism. this study reveals that all eleven arbitrarily chosen lactobacillus rhamnosus starter, laboratory and probiotic strains contain lb. rhamnosus phage lc-nu related nucleotide sequences. one of these highly homologous regions in the genome of phage lc-nu was the 2.4kb hindiii fragment, which has been sequenced. nucleotide  sequence analysis suggested that one side of the 2.4kb hindiii fragment encodes a phage lc-nu helicase and accordingly represents an early gene region of phage lc-nu genome. five forward and five reverse primers were derived from the nucleotide sequence of the 2.4kb hindiii fragment of phage lc-nu dna for pcr-based identification of the eleven lb. rhamnosus strains included in this study. six different types of pcr product patterns were obtained. among the patterns three were unique to particular lb. rhamnosus strains. the results suggest that phage-related dna sequences are, surprisingly, distributed widely among the lb. rhamnosus strains, and that these sequences could also be a source  of dna polymorphism to apply for dna-based identification of bacterial strains. phage lc-nu related dna homology was also found in the chromosome of lb. casei, the species closely related to lb. rhamnosus.

TI  == biosynthesis of lipoteichoic acid in lactobacillus rhamnosus: role of dltd in d-alanylation.
AB  == the dlt operon (dlta to dltd) of lactobacillus rhamnosus 7469 encodes four proteins responsible for the esterification of lipoteichoic acid (lta) by d-alanine. these esters play an important role in controlling the net anionic charge of the poly (grop) moiety of lta. dlta and dltc encode the d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase (dcl) and d-alanyl carrier protein (dcp), respectively. whereas the functions of dlta and dltc are defined, the functions of dltb and dltd are unknown. to define the role of dltd, the gene was  cloned and sequenced and a mutant was constructed by insertional mutagenesis of dltd from lactobacillus casei 102s. permeabilized cells of a dltd::erm mutant lacked the ability to incorporate d-alanine into lta. this defect was complemented by the expression of dltd from pnz123/dlt. in in vitro assays, dltd  bound dcp for ligation with d-alanine by dcl in the presence of atp. in contrast, the homologue of dcp, the escherichia coli acyl carrier protein (acp), involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, was not bound to dltd and thus was not ligated with d-alanine. dltd also catalyzed the hydrolysis of the mischarged d-alanyl-acp. the hydrophobic n-terminal sequence of dltd was required for anchoring the protein in the membrane. it is hypothesized that this membrane-associated dltd facilitates the binding of dcp and dcl for ligation of dcp with d-alanine and that the resulting d-alanyl-dcp is translocated to the primary site of d-alanylation.

AB  == in this study, investigations into the 23s-5s rrna intergenic spacer regions (isrs) of the lactobacillus casei group were performed. a 1.6 kb fragment, from lactobacillus paracasei strain atcc 27092, containing part of the 5s rrna gene (60 bp), the 5s-23s spacer region (198 bp) and part of the 23s rrna gene (1295 bp) was cloned and sequenced (genbank no. af098107). this fragment was used as a  probe to determine the rrna restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) patterns of nine strains belonging to the lactobacillus casei group, along with four other non-lactobacillus casei lactobacilli species. a pair of pcr primers, 23-fl and 5-ru, was designed and used for pcr amplification of the 23s-5s rrna isrs of these strains. the isr length and sequence polymorphisms provided additional information for the taxonomic study of the lactobacillus casei group.  the spacer-length polymorphism of lactobacillus rhamnosus was distinct from those of the other strains and this observation is consistent with the classification of lactobacillus rhamnosus proposed by mori et al. for all lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei strains, two major bands (approx. 250 and 170 bp in size) were obtained except in the case of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. tolerans strain ncimb 9709t, which yielded only one amplified product (250 bp). the sequencing data of the pcr products of seven well-characterized lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei strains revealed the presence of a 76/80 bp insertion/deletion with some random, single-base substitutions between the longer and shorter spacers for each respective strain. a few base variations were also detected within different strains in this group although the overall sequence similarity was very high (95.9-99.5%). the rrna rflp and the spacer sequence of lactobacillus casei type strain atcc 393t exhibited unique identities in this cluster. on the other hand, lactobacillus casei strain atcc 334 showed a high level of similarity with the other lactobacillus casei strains tested. these observations lend some support to the request for the reassignment of strain atcc 334 as the neotype of lactobacillus casei subsp. casei in place of strain atcc 393t.

TI  == probiotics and gastrointestinal health.
AB  == evidence for positive health benefits of lactobacilli applies to only a few strains used for commercial applications. it is generally agreed that a probiotic must be capable of colonizing the intestinal tract to influence human health; this requirement disqualifies many of the strains currently used in fermented dairy products. lactobacillus gg, a variant of l. casei sps rhamnosus, has been studied extensively in adults and children. when consumed as a dairy product or as a lyophilized powder, lgg colonizes the gastrointestinal tract for 1-3 days in most individuals and up to 7 days in about 30% of subjects. traveler's diarrhea,  antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and relapsing clostridium difficile colitis are improved with lgg. in infantile diarrhea, the severity and duration of the attack is reduced. lgg-fermented milk lessens the intestinal permeability defects caused by exposure to cows milk or rotavirus infection. lgg has proven beneficial effects on intestinal immunity. it increases the numbers of iga and other immunoglobulin-secreting cells in the intestinal mucosa. lgg stimulates local release of interferon. it facilitates antigen transport to underlying lymphoid cells, which serves to increase antigen uptake in peyer's patches. lgg also acts  as an immunoadjuvant for oral vaccines. in an animal model of colon cancer, lgg reduced the incidence of chemically induced tumors in the large bowel of rodents. extensive safety testing has shown no pathogenic potential in humans or animals.  probiotic cultures of lactobacilli have the potential to bring substantial health benefits to the consumer. the purported benefits for any probiotic must pass the  highest standards of scientific scrutiny before the claims can be accepted.

TI  == screening of probiotic activities of forty-seven strains of lactobacillus spp. by in vitro techniques and evaluation of the colonization ability of five selected strains in humans.
AB  == the probiotic potential of 47 selected strains of lactobacillus spp. was investigated. the strains were examined for resistance to ph 2.5 and 0.3% oxgall, adhesion to caco-2 cells, and antimicrobial activities against enteric pathogenic bacteria in model systems. from the results obtained in vitro, five strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, l. rhamnosus lgg, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis chcc 2329, and l. casei subsp. alactus chcc 3137, were  selected for in vivo studies. the daily consumption by 12 healthy volunteers of two doses of 10(10) freeze-dried bacteria of the selected strains for 18 days was followed by a washout period of 17 days. fecal samples were taken at days 0 and 18 and during the washout period at days 5 and 11. lactobacillus isolates were initially identified by api 50chl and internal transcribed spacer pcr, and their  identities were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis in combination with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. among the tested strains, l. rhamnosus 19070-2, l. reuteri dsm 12246, and l. rhamnosus lgg were identified most frequently in fecal samples; they were found in 10, 8, and 7 of the 12 samples tested during the intervention period, respectively, whereas reisolations were less frequent in the washout period. the bacteria were reisolated in concentrations from 10(5) to  10(8) cells/g of feces. survival and reisolation of the bacteria in vivo appeared to be linked to ph tolerance, adhesion, and antimicrobial properties in vitro.

TI  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the adhesion of pathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == human intestinal glycoproteins extracted from faeces were used as a model for intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella strains, and the effect of probiotics on this adhesion. s-fimbriated e. coli expressed relatively high adhesion in the mucus model, but the other tested pathogens adhered less effectively. probiotic strains lactobacillus gg and l. rhamnosus lc-705 as well as a l. rhamnosus isolated from human faeces were able to slightly reduce s-fimbria-mediated adhesion. adhesion of s. typhimurium was significantly inhibited by probiotic l. johnsonii lj1 and l. casei shirota. lactobacillus gg and l. rhamnosus (human isolate) increased the adhesion of s. typhimurium suggesting that the pathogen interacts with the probiotic.

TI  == the effect of orally administered viable probiotic and dairy lactobacilli on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
AB  == four common lactobacillus strains were screened for their effects on proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. mice received perorally 10(9) viable  bacteria kg(-1) body weight for 7 days. lactobacillus acidophilus treatment enhanced ex vivo basal proliferation (by 43%) and b-cell response at suboptimal and optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (lps) (by 27-28%). conversely, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited  both basal proliferation (by 14-51%) and mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation,  particularly at supra-optimal concentrations of concanavalin a (by 43-68%) and lps (by 23-62%). therefore, these lactobacillus strains demonstrate strain-specific effects on b- and t-cells and may also alter the splenocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of mitogens.

TI  == differentiation of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus rhamnosus by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == lactobacillus casei, lact. paracasei and lact. rhamnosus form a closely related taxonomic group within the heterofermentative lactobacilli. these three species are difficult to differentiate using traditional fermentation profiles. we have developed polymerase chain reaction primers which are specific for each of these  species based on differences in the v1 region of the 16s rrna gene. sixty-three lactobacillus isolates from cheese were identified using these primers. the 12 lact. rhamnosus and 51 lact. paracasei identified in this way were also differentiated using a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) primer.

TI  == identification of lactobacillus isolates from the gastrointestinal tract, silage, and yoghurt by 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer region sequence comparisons.
AB  == lactobacillus isolates were identified by pcr amplification and sequencing of the region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes (spacer region). the sequences obtained from the isolates were compared to those of reference strains held in genbank. a  similarity of 97.5% or greater was considered to provide identification. to check the reliability of the method, the v2-v3 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced in the case of isolates whose spacer region sequences were less than 99% similar to that of a reference strain. confirmation of identity was obtained in all instances. spacer region sequencing provided rapid and accurate identification of lactobacillus isolates obtained from gastrointestinal, yoghurt, and silage samples. it had an advantage over 16s v2-v3 sequence comparisons because it distinguished between isolates of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus.

TI  == [persistent lactobacillus casei subspecies rhamnosus bacteremia in a 14 year old  girl with acute myeloid leukemia. a case report].
AB  == the present clinical observation is related to a 14-year-old girl suffering from  acute myeloid leukemia. the clinical course was complicated by episodes of severe enterocolitis, e. coli- septicemia, pancreatitis and pneumonia. in the course of  continued cytostatic and antibiotic treatment a persistent asymptomatic lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus-bacteremia became detectable by a total of 18 blood cultures. microbial cultures of the faeces revealed colony-forming unites of this germ in orders of 10(9)/g. antibiotic eradication attempts according to the resistogram were not successful. the lactobacillus-bacteremia disappeared only after 13 months when the cytostatic therapy was terminated. an adjuvant influence of the lactobacillus infection on the outcome of the underlying disease cannot be excluded.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == isolation and identification of lactobacilli from novel-type probiotic and mild yoghurts and their stability during refrigerated storage.
AB  == a total of 26 lactobacillus strains were isolated from various mild yoghurts and  novel-type probiotic dairy products and from a starter culture preparation and were identified by using dna-dna hybridization technique. the species present in  those products were found to be lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. dna homology analysis revealed that some strains had been misclassified by their investigators. three strains designated as l. acidophilus (l. acidophilus la-1, l. acidophilus atcc 43121 and the lactobacillus strain from biogarde culture) were found to belong to l. johnsonii and l. acidophilus l1 to be l. crispatus. strains designated as l. casei were found to be members of three separate species: l. casei, l. paracasei  and l. rhamnosus. viable numbers of lactobacilli in mild and probiotic yoghurts varied greatly including some products with very low lactobacillus counts. the majority of the probiotic yoghurts, however, contained viable counts above 10(5)  per g even at the end of the best before use period.

TI  == insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  == most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon tn916 mutagenesis of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis). a 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dlta and dltb of lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (formerly called lactobacillus casei). a 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous dna in a fosmid library of s. gordonii dl1. this dna encoded d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. the cloned streptococcal dlta was disrupted by inserting an ermam cassette, and then it was  linearized and transformed into s. gordonii dl1 for allelic replacement. erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dlta exhibited a loss of d-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (lta) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. this phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kda surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (c. j. whittaker, d. l. clemans, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). the mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric  coaggregations. the mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. the natural dna transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. southern analysis of chromosomal dnas from  various streptococcal species with the dlta probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. thus, it is hypothesized that d-alanyl lta may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kda adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.

TI  == regulated expression of the streptococcus mutans dlt genes correlates with intracellular polysaccharide accumulation.
AB  == intracellular polysaccharides (ips) are glycogen-like storage polymers which contribute significantly to streptococcus mutans-induced cariogenesis. we previously identified and cloned a locus from the s. mutans chromosome which is required for the accumulation of ips. sequencing of this locus revealed at least  four contiguous open reading frames, all of which are preceded by a common promoter region and are transcribed in the same direction. analysis of the amino  acid sequence deduced from the first of these open reading frames (orf1) revealed domains which are highly conserved among d-alanine-activating enzymes (dlta) in lactobacillus rhamnosus (formerly lactobacillus casei) and bacillus subtilis. the deduced amino acid sequences derived from orf2, -3, and -4 also exhibit extensive similarity to dltb, -c, and -d, respectively, in these microorganisms. however, southern hybridization experiments indicate that this operon maps to a locus on the s. mutans chromosome which is separate from the glgp, glga, and glgd genes, whose products are known mediators of bacterial ips accumulation. we therefore assigned a new dlt designation to the locus which we had formerly called glg. we  maintain that the dlt genes are involved in s. mutans ips accumulation, however,  since they complement a mutation in trans which otherwise renders s. mutans ips deficient. in this study, we found that expression of the s. mutans dlt genes is  growth phase dependent and is modulated by carbohydrates internalized via the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts). we demonstrated that the s.  mutans dlt genes are expressed constitutively when non-pts sugars are provided as the sole source of carbohydrate. consistent with a role for the pts in dlt expression is a similar constitutive expression of the dlt genes in an s. mutans  pts mutant grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented with glucose. in summary, these findings support a novel role for the dlt gene products in s. mutans ips accumulation and suggest that dlt expression in this oral pathogen is  subject to complex mechanisms of control imposed by growth phase, dietary carbohydrate, and other factors present in the plaque environment.

TI  == adhesion of some probiotic and dairy lactobacillus strains to caco-2 cell cultures.
AB  == the adhesion of 12 different lactobacillus strains was studied using caco-2 cell  line as an in vitro model for intestinal epithelium. some of the strains tested have been used as probiotics, and most of them are used in the dairy and food industry. human and bovine enterotoxigenic escherichia coli strains were used as  positive and negative control, respectively. bacterial adhesion to caco-2 cell cultures was quantitated using radiolabelled bacteria. the adherence of bacteria  was also observed microscopically after gram staining. viability of bacteria prior to adhesion was verified using flow cytometry. among the tested strains, l. casei (fyos) was the most adhesive strain and l. casei var. rhamnosus (lactophilus) was the least adhesive strain, approximately 14 and 3% of the added bacteria adhered to caco-2 cell cultures, respectively. the corresponding values  for positive and negative control e. coli strains were 14 and 4%, respectively. the lactobacillus strains tested could not be divided into distinctly adhesive or non-adhesive strains, since there was a continuation of adhesion rates. the four  most adhesive strains were l. casei (fyos), l. acidophilus 1 (lc1), l. rhamnosus  lc-705 and lactobacillus gg (atcc 53103). no significant differences in the percentage adhesion were observed between these strains. adhesion of all the strains was dependent on the number of bacteria used, since an approximately constant number of caco-2 cells was used, indicating that the caco-2 cell binding sites were not saturated. viability of bacteria was high since approximately 90%  of the bacteria were viable with the exception of l. acidophilus 1 which was 74%  viable. microscopic evaluations agreed with the radiolabelled binding as evidenced by observing more bacteria in gram-stained preparations of good adhering strains compared to poorly adhering strains.

TI  == nutrient leaching and end product accumulation in plastic composite supports for  l-(+)-lactic acid biofilm fermentation.
AB  == investigations on the leachate bioavailability, leaching rate, and lactic acid accumulation properties of plastic composite supports (pcs) were essential for large-scale or long-term lactic acid fermentation. leachates from pcs and polypropylene discs (controls) were analyzed by the micro-kjeldahl method; by absorbances at 260, 275, and 280 nm; and by bioassays with lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus (atcc 11443). the amount of leached nitrogen in a 20-ml initial  soaking solution had a high correlation with the soaking solution's cell density  (r = 0.87) and absorbance at 260 nm (r = 0.95). leaching rates of various pcs were evaluated by 20 20-ml simulated repeated-batch fermentations (rbf). pcs with only yeast extract as the minor agricultural ingredient had a high leaching rate  and leached out 51 to 60% of the total nitrogen during the first rbf. pcs blended with dried bovine albumin, dried bovine erythrocytes, and/or soybean flour had slowed nutrient leaching (20 to 30% of the initial leached nitrogen). hence, they could still maintain 1 g of lactic acid per liter and measurable cell density (absorbance at 620 nm, 0.4 to 0.6) at the 20th 20-ml rbf. lactic acid accumulation properties of pcs were evaluated by soaking the supports in a 30% lactic acid solution for 72 h at 45(deg)c. the lactic acid-soaked supports were rinsed three times and then heat treated (121(deg)c, 15 min) in 15 ml of deionized water. the results showed that lactic acid accumulation in pcs was mainly due to absorption and had no correlation with lactic acid production or biofilm formation.

AB  == four customized bioreactors, three with plastic composite supports (pcs) and one  with suspended cells (control), were operated as repeated-batch fermentors for 66 days at ph 5 and 37 degrees c. the working volume of each customized reactor was  600 ml, and each reactor's medium was changed every 2 to 5 days for 17 batches. the performance of pcs bioreactors in long-term biofilm repeated-batch fermentation was compared with that of suspended-cell bioreactors in this research. pcs could stimulate biofilm formation, supply nutrients to attached and free suspended cells, and reduce medium channelling for lactic acid production. compared with conventional repeated-batch fermentation, pcs bioreactors shortened the lag time by threefold (control, 11 h; pcs, 3.5 h) and sixfold (control, 9 h;  pcs, 1.5 h) at yeast extract concentrations of 0.4 and 0.8% (wt/vol), respectively. they also increased the lactic acid productivity of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus (atcc 11443) by 40 to 70% and shortened the total fermentation time by 28 to 61% at all yeast extract concentrations. the fastest productivity of the pcs bioreactors (4.26 g/liter/h) was at a starting glucose concentration of 10% (wt/vol), whereas that of the control (2.78 g/liter/h) was at 8% (wt/vol). pcs biofilm lactic acid fermentation can drastically improve the  fermentation rate with reduced complex-nutrient addition.

TI  == ingredient selection for plastic composite supports for l-(+)-lactic acid biofilm fermentation by lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus.
AB  == plastic composite supports containing 50% agricultural products (oat hulls, soybean hulls, yeast extract, soybean flour, dried bovine erythrocytes, bovine albumin, and/or mineral salts) and 50% (wt/wt) polypropylene were produced by high-temperature twin-screw extrusion. the research employed two half sets of a five-factorial fractional design (2(5 - 1)) to evaluate the effects of different  agricultural components on the properties of the plastic composite supports and to select the best plastic composite support formulation for lactic acid fermentation. the biofilm population was affected by the contact angle and relative hydrophobicity of the supports (r = 0.79 to 0.82). lactic acid was produced by the suspended cells (r = 0.96) and the biofilm on the plastic composite support discs (r = 0.85). incorporation of yeast extract into plastic composite supports enhanced growth of free and attached cells in minimal medium (p < 0.0001). the presence of soybean hulls, yeast extract, or mineral salts in plastic composite supports produced less hydrophobic supports (p < 0.0001) and enhanced cell attachment (p < 0.03). under all conditions, suspended-cell and polypropylene disc controls gave negligible lactic acid production and cell density. plastic composite supports containing soybean hulls, yeast extract, soybean flour, bovine albumin, and mineral salts gave the highest biofilm population (2.3 x 10(9) cfu/g of support), cell density (absorbance of 1.8 at 620 nm), and lactic acid concentration (7.6 g/liter) in minimal medium.

AB  == hydrophilic and electrostatic cell surface properties of eight lactobacillus strains were characterized by using the microbial adhesion to solvents method and microelectrophoresis, respectively. all strains appeared relatively hydrophilic.  the strong microbial adhesion to chloroform, an acidic solvent, in comparison with microbial adhesion to hexadecane, an apolar n-alkane, demonstrated the particularity of lactobacilli to have an important electron donor and basic character and consequently their potential ability to generate lewis acid-base interactions with a support. regardless of their electrophoretic mobility (em), strains were in general slightly negatively charged at alkaline ph. a ph-dependent behavior concerning cell surface charges was observed. the em decreased progressively with more acidic phs for the l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains until the isoelectric point (iep), i.e., the ph value for which the em is zero. on the other hand, the em for the l. rhamnosus strains was stable from ph 8 to ph 3 to 4, at which point there was a shift near  the iep. both l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains were characterized by an iep of around 4, whereas l. rhamnosus strains possessed  a markedly lower iep of 2. the present study showed that the cell surface physicochemical properties of lactobacilli seem to be, at least in part and under certain experimental conditions, particular to the bacterial species. such differences detected between species are likely to be accompanied by some particular changes in cell wall chemical composition.

AB  == lactobacillus endocarditis is a rare infection. in fact, only 42 cases have been  described in the literature from 1938 up to date. in only 17 previously reported  cases have patients been cured with medical therapy alone. although infections produced by lactobacillus spp, have been described in our country, none of them included endocarditis. we report herein a case of endocarditis due to a vancomycin-resistant strain of lactobacillus casei sub. rhamnosus in a 29-year-old man with prolapse of the mitral valve. he required surgical replacement of his valve because of the poor response to antimicrobial therapy with penicillin and gentamicin. the patient displayed a successful clinical outcome, with no evidence of recurrence along the subsequent 2 years. we point out the need to accurately identify lactobacillus spp. in isolates from blood cultures of patients with endocarditis, since these bacteria may often be mistaken for other species more frequently associated to this infection, which usually respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy. furthermore, we suggest that early surgical replacement should be considered when lactobacillus endocarditis is diagnosed.

AB  == the type strain of lactobacillus casei subsp. casei (atcc 393) exhibits low levels of dna homology with other strains of l. casei subsp. casei (8 to 46%) and strains of lactobacillus paracasei (30 to 50%), but exhibits a level of dna similarity of 80% with lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 15820, the original type strain of "lactobacterium zeae" kuznetsov 1959. strains atcc 393t (t = type strain) and atcc 15820t are members of one protein profile cluster that is separate from the other lactobacillus spp. the randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr profile of strain atcc 393t is also different from the profiles obtained for  the other species. l. casei atcc 334t is genetically closely related to l. casei  subsp. casei strains (71 to 97%) and l. paracasei strains (71 to 91%), is a member of the same protein profile cluster as these organisms, and shares several dna amplicons with l. paracasei strains. on the basis of these results, we propose that l. casei subsp. casei atcc 393t and l. rhamnosus atcc 15820 should be reclassified as members of lactobacillus zeae nom. rev. (type strain, atcc 15820), that strain atcc 334 should be designated the neotype strain of l. casei  subsp. casei, and that the name l. paracasei should be rejected.

TI  == effect of acetate on sorbitol fermentation by oral lactobacilli.
AB  == the rate of acid production and end-products from sorbitol were measured under anaerobic conditions in washed-cell suspensions of oral strains of lactobacillus  casei subsp. casei and lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus. the enzymatic activities were assayed in cell extracts of these strains. the cells fermented sorbitol to lactate, formate, ethanol and acetate under anaerobic conditions. exposure of the cells to air (oxygen) led to inactivation of pyruvate formate-lyase and inhibition of anaerobic sorbitol fermentation. in the presence  of acetate, air-exposed cells fermented sorbitol with a concomitant consumption of acetate and production of ethanol and lactate. acetate also enhanced acid production from sorbitol in cells kept under anaerobic conditions and resulted in formation of lactate and ethanol. cell extracts of all the strains had nadh-coupled acetate-reducing activity, which consisted of sequential reactions of acetate kinase, phosphotransacetylase, acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. these findings indicate that oral lactobacilli can utilize acetate as an electron acceptor for maintaining their intracellular redox balance during anaerobic sorbitol fermentation in the absence of pyruvate formate-lyase activity.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == in vitro inhibition of helicobacter pylori nctc 11637 by organic acids and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == in this study the effects of both ph and organic acids on helicobacter pylori nctc 11637 were tested. lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. casei, lact. bulgaricus, pediococcus pentosaceus and bifidobacterium bifidus were assayed for their lactic acid production, ph and inhibition of h. pylori growth. a standard antimicrobial  plate well diffusion assay was employed to examine inhibitory effects. lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids demonstrated inhibition of h. pylori growth in a concentration-dependent manner with the lactic acid demonstrating the greatest inhibition. this inhibition was due both to the ph of the solution and its concentration. six strains of lact. acidophilus and one strain of lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus inhibited h. pylori growth where as bifidobacterium bifidus, ped. pentosaceus and lact. bulgaricus did not. concentrations of lactic acid produced by these strains ranged from 50 to 156 mmol l-1 and correlated with h. pylori inhibition. the role of probiotic organisms and their metabolic by-products in the eradication of h. pylori in vivo remains to be determined.

TI  == influence of lactobacilli on the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans to fibers and epithelial cells.
AB  == the ability of organisms to adhere to and form biofilms on fibrous materials is believed to be an important initiating step in the induction of several diseases, such as toxic shock syndrome. using an in vitro assay, a moderately hydrophobic strain of staphylococcus aureus (water contact angle 35 degrees) and a hydrophilic candida albicans (shown by a hexadecane test) were highly adherent to commercial diaper fibers. the lumen side of the diaper was porous and the fibers  were very hydrophobic (> 140 degrees), but the internal section was very hydrophilic (0 degrees), presumably for lus strains was present. surfaces precoated with lactobacilli inhibited staphylococcal adhesion by 26-97%, and candida by 0-67%. when the lactobacilli were used to challenge adherent pathogens, there was 99% displacement of the s. aureus and up to 91% displacement of c. albicans. hydrophobic l. acidophilus 76 (54 degrees) and t-13 (80 degrees)  were the most effective of five lactobacillus isolates tested at interference by  precoating. the moderately hydrophilic l. casei var rhamnosus gr-1 (33 degrees) was the most effective at displacing the yeast. experiments with uroepithelial cells also showed that the lactobacilli could significantly interfere with the adhesion of both pathogens to the cells. the results demonstrate the rapidity with which two pathogens adhered to fibers and epithelial cells, and raised the possibility that members of the normal female urogenital flora might interfere with infections caused by these organisms.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg (atcc 53103) on the growth of streptococcus sobrinus in vitro.
AB  == lactobacillus gg, a recently characterized l. rhamnosus gg strain (atcc 53103), has been shown to exert inhibitory activity against a variety of bacterial species, including streptococci. we isolated and studied the effect of the inhibitory substance of lactobacillus gg on some oral streptococci. the inhibitory activity of the isolated substance was weak, but some growth inhibition was observed in streptococcus sobrinus pretreated with the substance in comparison with untreated controls. zones of growth inhibition on agar plates  were apparent only at ph values below 5, indicating that the inhibitory activity  was restricted to a low ph range. growth curve experiments showed a statistically significant inhibition between series with and without the isolated substance (p  < 0.05). the ultrastructure of s. sobrinus was not affected when treated with the inhibitory substance. the lactobacillus gg itself did not ferment sucrose. the results offer interesting perspectives for future research focusing on the protective function of normal flora and in the attempt to replace harmful bacterial species in oral microflora with less harmful ones.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria in the treatment of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis.
AB  == we compared different lactic acid bacteria for their effect on the immune response to rotavirus in children with acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. after initial oral rehydration, 49 children aged 6 to 35 months with rotavirus gastroenteritis randomly received either lactobacillus casei subsp. casei strain  gg (lgg), l. casei subsp. rhamnosus (lactophilus), or a combination of streptococcus thermophilus and l. delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus (yalacta) twice daily for 5 days. serum antibodies to rotavirus, total number of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (isc), and specific antibody-secreting cells (sasc) to rotavirus were measured at the acute stage and at convalescence. the mean (sd) duration of diarrhea was 1.8 (0.8) days in children who received lgg, 2.8 (1.2) days in those receiving lactophilus, and 2.6 (1.4) days in those receiving yalacta (f = 3.3, p = 0.04). the isc response was comparable in the three study groups, but the rotavirus-specific immune responses were different. lgg therapy was associated with an enhancement of iga sasc to rotavirus and serum iga antibody level at convalescent stage. we conclude that certain strains of lactic acid bacteria, particularly lgg, promote serum and intestinal immune responses to rotavirus, and thus may be important in establishing immunity against rotavirus reinfections.

TI  == specific and charge interactions mediate collagen recognition by oral lactobacilli.
AB  == the mechanisms by which oral lactobacilli, one of the three major genera of cariogenic bacteria, attach to tooth surfaces are unknown. we hypothesize that recognition of collagen, the major component of dentin, may be a mechanism which  localizes these bacteria to exposed root surfaces as well as to carious lesions which have penetrated the dentin. we found that the majority of oral lactobacillus spp. strains recognize and bind collagen type i. binding of 125i-labeled collagen type i to two strains of l. casei rhamnosus has been characterized in some detail. these strains were previously characterized with respect to their attachment to dentin (switalski and butcher, 1994). the process  of 125i-collagen binding was mediated via specific as well as charge interactions. the putative adhesin-mediated (specific) interaction involved a limited number of bacterial surface components (2 x 10(3)/cell). under conditions conducive for non-specific interactions (low ionic strength), the binding was higher by an order of magnitude. collagen binding strains were found to adhere to collagen-coated surfaces, while strains unable to bind collagen adhered to a much lesser extent. adherence of bacteria to collagen-coated surfaces could be competitively inhibited with collagen. these interactions may target collagen-binding strains of lactobacilli to dentin collagen in the oral cavity and thus play a role in the pathogenesis of root surface and/or coronal caries. interference with this collagen-mediated attachment of lactobacilli may provide effective means of caries control, particularly in view of the fact that other oral acidogenic microbiota also interact with collagen.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.

TI  == lactic acid production in a mixed-culture biofilm reactor.
AB  == novel solid supports, consisting of polypropylene blended with various agricultural materials (pp composite), were evaluated as supports for pure- and mixed-culture continuous lactic acid fermentations in biofilm reactors. streptomyces viridosporus t7a (atcc 39115) was used to form a biofilm, and lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus (atcc 11443) was used for lactic acid production. for mixed-culture fermentations, a 15-day continuous fermentation of  s. viridosporus was performed initially to establish the biofilm. the culture medium was then inoculated with l. casei subsp. rhamnosus. for pure-culture fermentation, l. casei subsp. rhamnosus was inoculated directly into the reactors containing sterile pp composite chips. the biofilm reactors containing various pp composite chips were compared with a biofilm reactor containing pure polypropylene chips and with a reactor containing a suspension culture. continuous fermentation was started, and each flow rate (0.06 to 1.92 ml/min) was held constant for 24 h; steady state was achieved after 10 h. lactic acid production was determined throughout the 24-h period by high-performance liquid chromatography. production rates that were two to five times faster than those of the suspension culture (control) were observed for the pure- and mixed-culture bioreactors. both lactic acid production rates and lactic acid concentrations in  the culture medium were consistently higher in mixed-culture than in pure-culture fermentations. biofilm formation on the chips was detected at harvest by chip clumping and gram staining.

TI  == [standardization of the direct hemagglutination reaction induced by bacteria of the genus lactobacillus].
AB  == l. bulgaricus, l. casei var. rhamnosus, and l. plantarum cells grown in agar-containing (but not liquid) thioglycol medium for 3 days have been shown to  be capable of inducing mannose-resistant agglutination of human and guinea-pig erythrocytes, while giving a considerably weaker reaction with erythrocytes from  animals of other species (ox, sheep, dog, rabbit, rat and mouse). the optimum conditions for the test are presented.

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.

TI  == effect of growth conditions on production of rhamnose-containing cell wall and capsular polysaccharides by strains of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus possessing two cell wall polysaccharides, a hexosamine-containing h-polysaccharide and a rhamnose-containing r-polysaccharide, were examined for the effect of growth conditions on the production of these two components. in strain nctc 6375, r- and h-polysaccharides accounted for an estimated 44 and 20%, respectively, of the cell wall for organisms grown in batch culture with glucose as the carbohydrate source. growth on fructose-containing media reduced the amount of r-polysaccharide by approximately 50% without affecting the amount of h-polysaccharide. subculture of fructose-grown organisms in glucose restored the  original proportions of the two polysaccharides. galactose- and sucrose-grown cells behaved similarly to glucose-grown cells with respect to polysaccharide production, whereas growth in rhamnose or ribose showed values close to those for fructose-grown cells. continuous culture of strain nctc 6375 for more than 100 generations showed a gradual and irreversible reduction of the r-polysaccharide to less than 5% of the cell wall and an increase of the h-polysaccharide to 40% of the cell wall. other type culture strains of l. casei subsp. rhamnosus, ncib 7473 and atcc 7469, behaved similarly in batch and continuous culture. in contrast, strains of l. casei subsp. rhamnosus isolated at the institute of dental research showed phenotypic stability with respect to the relative proportions of r- and h-polysaccharides in both batch and continuous culture. changes in polysaccharide composition of type culture strains were also mirrored  in changes in the immunogenicity of the two components and resistance to the rate of enzymic lysis of whole organisms. for l. casei subsp. rhamnosus strain nctc 10302 the r-polysaccharide is present entirely as capsular material. the amount of r-polysaccharide produced was also markedly dependent on the carbohydrate component of the medium in batch culture and both dilution rate and nature of the limiting carbohydrate in continuous culture, varying over a 10-fold range, whereas the cell wall h-polysaccharide remained constant.

TI  == lipoquinones of some spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomycetes.
AB  == the respiratory quinones of 73 strains of gram-positive bacteria including spore-forming rods, lactic-acid bacteria and actinomyctes were examined. menaquinones with seven isoprenoid units (mk-7) were the main quinone type found  in representatives of the genus bacillus and in sporolactobacillus inulinus. however, a strain of b. thuringiensis produced mk-8 in addition to mk-7, and strains of b. lentus and b. pantothenticus appeared to produce mk-9 and mk-8, respectively, with no mk-7. in the clostridia and lactic-acid bacteria, no quinones were found, except in pediococcus cerevisiae nctc 8066 and lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus atcc 7469, which contained menaquinones, and streptococcus faecalis nctc 775 and him 478-1, which contained demethylmenaquinones, in relatively low concentrations. menaquinones were also found in the actinomycetes  (except actinomyces odontolyticus and bifidobacterium bifidum which did not produce any quinones) and in protaminobacter alboflavus atcc 8458, the so-called  actinobacillus actinoides atcc 15900 and noguchia granulosis nctc 10559.

TI  == [lactobacilli of freshwater fishes].
AB  == normal microflora in the intestinal tract of fishes inhabiting fresh-water reservoirs includes lactic bacteria. the number of the bacteria depends on the animal species, the composition of food, the age, and the season. the highest number of these microorganisms (hundreds of millions per gram of the intestinal content) is found in carps. enterococci are most often encountered in fishes inhabiting ponds: streptococcus faecalis andrewes a. horder, str. faecium orla-jensen, str. bovis orla-jensen. lactobacilli are more typical of fishes in water reserviors: lactobacillus plantarum (orla-jensen) bergey et al., l. casei (orla-jensen) hansen a. lessel, l. casei var. casei, l. casei var. rhamnosus, l.  casei var. alactosus, l. leichmannii (henneberg) bergey et al., l. acidophillus (moro) hansen a. mocquot, l. fermenti beijerinck, l. cellobiosus rogosa et al., l. buchneri (henneberg) bergey et al. the content of lactic bacteria varies in water reservoirs; their highest content is found in ooze (tens of thousands per gram).

TI  == evidence for extrachromosomal elements in lactobacillus.
AB  == three strains of lactobacilli, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei 64h, l. casei subsp. rhamnosus oc91, and l. coryniformis m34, were examined for the presence of plasmids. plasmids of molecular weights of 23 x 10(6) and 16 x 10(6) were found in the first two strains respectively. this represents the first evidence for plasmids in lactobacilli; their function is not presently known.

TI  == purification, properties and immunological relationship of l (+)-lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus casei.
AB  == the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-activated l-lactate dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.27) from lactobacillus casei atcc 393 has been purified to homogenity by including affinity chromatography (cibacronblue-sephadex-g-200) and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis into the purification procedures. the enzyme has an mr of 132000-135000 with a subunit mr of 34000. the ph optimum was found to be 5.4 insodium acetate buffer. tris/maleate and citrate/phosphate buffers inhibited enzyme activity at this ph. the enzyme was completely inactivated by a  temperature increase from 60 degrees c to 70 degrees c. pyruvate saturation curves were sigmoidal in the absence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 20 mum fructose 1,6-bisphosphate a km of 1.0 mm for pyruvate was obtained, whereas fructose 1,6-bisphosphate had no effect on the km of 0.01 mm for nadh. the use of pyruvate analogues revealed two types of pyruvate binding sites, a catalytic and an effector site. the enzyme from l. casei appears to be subject to strict metabolic control, since adp, atp, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate are strong inhibitors. immunodiffusion experiments with a  rabbit antiserum to l. casei lactate dehydrogenase revealed that l. casei atcc 393 l (+)-lactate dehydrogenase is probably not immunologically related to group  d and group n streptococci. of 24 lactic acid bacterial strains tested only 5 strains did cross-react: l. casei atcc 393 = l. casei var. rhamnosus atcc 7469 -  l. casei var. alactosus ncdo 680 greater than l. casei uqm 95 greater than l. plantarum atcc 14917.

TI  == the effect of medium redox potential on the folate-limited growth of lactobacillus casei var. rhamnosus.
AB  == the medium redox potential (eh) influenced the folate-limited growth of lactobacillus casei; the growth response was maximal at an eh of +120 mv (ph 6-35). at raised eh serum folate would support less growth than pteroylglutamic acid, and the response to n5-methyl tetrahydrofolic acid was intermediate between them. pteroylglutamic acid was not destroyed during 24 h incubation at 37 degrees c in medium with eh values between +40 and +440 mv. destruction of n5-methyl tetrahydrofolic acid occurred within 24 h when the medium eh was greater than +125 mv. folate was taken up rapidly by l. casei with an eh optimum at +270 mv.
