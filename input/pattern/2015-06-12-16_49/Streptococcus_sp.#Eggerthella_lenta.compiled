TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  - Multiple bacteria in aortic aneurysms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to reexamine the possibility that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, are present in aortic aneurysms. METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2001, 53 samples from aneurysm walls were collected from 49 patients during reconstructive surgery. The tissue specimens were sectioned and cultured under anaerobic conditions. Twenty-eight specimens were also subjected to scanning or transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: Anaerobic cultivation yielded bacteria in 14 of the 53 samples (26.4%). All bacteria were gram-positive cocci or rods from nine genera and 12 species. Five cultures (35%) were mixed, containing two bacterial species. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic species were found in four samples (28.5%). Anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 10 of 14 positive cultures (71%). Among anaerobes found were Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Eggerthella lenta. Coaggregating bacteria of different sizes and structure were found on the aneurysm walls and inside the intravascular plaque at electron microscopy. Bacteria were found in 20 of the 28 samples (71%) examined with scanning or transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSION: Multiple bacteria, many of which did not belong to the indigenous skin microflora, colonize aortic aneurysms. It is not clear whether the bacteria contribute to weakening of the aortic wall by eliciting inflammation or whether they are secondary colonizers of aneurysms.
TI  - Bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. However, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. OBJECTIVE: To determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). Specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; P < 0.01). Bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). Other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were Peptostreptococcus micros (66%), Bilophila wadsworthia (63%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (44%), Eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (41%). Of the aerobes Escherichia coli (88%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (former Streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. CONCLUSIONS: The shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. The unusually high frequencies of B. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
