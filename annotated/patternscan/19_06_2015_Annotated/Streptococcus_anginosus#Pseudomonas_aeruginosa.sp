TI  == quantification of pseudomonas aeruginosa in multispecies biofilms using pma-qpcr.
AB  == multispecies biofilms are an important healthcare problem and may lead to persistent infections. these infections are difficult to treat, as cells in a biofilm are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents. while increasingly being recognized as important, the properties of multispecies biofilms remain poorly studied. in order to do so, the quantification of the individual species is needed. the current cultivation-based approaches can lead to an underestimation of the actual cell number and are time-consuming. in the present study we set up  a culture-independent approach based on propidium monoazide qpcr (pma-qpcr) to quantify pseudomonas aeruginosa in a multispecies biofilm. as a proof of concept, we explored the influence of the combined presence of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus and burkholderia cenocepacia on the antimicrobial susceptibility of p. aeruginosa using this pma-qpcr approach.

TI  == environment and colonisation sequence are key parameters driving cooperation and  competition between pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis strains and oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patient airways harbour diverse microbial consortia that, in addition to the recognized principal pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, include other bacteria commonly regarded as commensals. the latter include the oral (viridans) streptococci, which recent evidence indicates play an active role during infection of this environmentally diverse niche. as the interactions between inhabitants of the cf airway can potentially alter disease progression, it is important to identify key cooperators/competitors and environmental influences if therapeutic intervention is to be improved and pulmonary decline arrested. importantly, we recently showed that virulence of the p. aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) could be potentiated by the anginosus-group of streptococci (ags). in the present study we explored the relationships between other viridans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus sanguinis) and the les and observed that co-culture outcome was dependent upon inoculation sequence and environment. all four streptococcal species were shown to potentiate les virulence factor production in co-culture biofilms. however, in the case of s. oralis interactions were environmentally determined; in air cooperation within a high cell density co-culture biofilm occurred together with stimulation of les virulence factor production, while in an atmosphere containing added co2 this species became a competitor antagonising les growth through hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) production, significantly altering biofilm population dynamics and appearance. streptococcus  mitis, s. gordonii and s. sanguinis were also capable of h2o2 mediated inhibition of p. aeruginosa growth, but this was only visible when inoculated as a primary coloniser prior to introduction of the les. therefore, these observations, which  are made in conditions relevant to the biology of cf disease pathogenesis, show that the pathogenic and colonisation potential of p. aeruginosa isolates can be modulated positively and negatively by the presence of oral commensal streptococci.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == differential potentiation of the virulence of the pseudomonas aeruginosa cystic fibrosis liverpool epidemic strain by oral commensal streptococci.
AB  == background: the pseudomonas aeruginosa liverpool epidemic strain (les) is an important cystic fibrosis (cf) pathogen and is associated with increased morbidity and a worsened prognosis, compared with other cf-associated strains. however, interactions of common les phenotypic variants with other members of the polymicrobial biofilms associated with chronic cf respiratory disease, such as oral commensal streptococci, have not been investigated. methods: biofilm population dynamics, virulence factor production, and pathogenicity in galleria mellonella larvae of common les phenotypes (ie, low production, intermediate production, and overproduction of pyocyanin) in the presence or absence of anginosus group streptococci (ags) were compared. results: ags populations isolated from biofilm cocultures were p. aeruginosa phenotypic variant dependent, with higher ags cell densities than those in monoculture frequently observed. coexistence of ags with a producer of low or intermediate levels of pyocyanin was found to result in enhancement of virulence factor production. in addition, the les formed pathogenic partnerships with ags in the g. mellonella infection model, with killing dependent on les phenotype and ags species. conclusions: the pathogenic potential of les phenotypic variants can be enhanced by the presence of oral commensal streptococci. as adaptive mutations leading to reduced virulence factor production are commonplace, the observations made are relevant in the general context of the biology of p. aeruginosa infection during cf.

TI  == 64-year-old male with septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis.
AB  == septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis is a rare disease. typical clinical features include fever, pubic or groin pain, pain with hip motion, and painful or waddling gait. identified predisposing factors to develop an infection in pubic joint include female incontinence surgery or postpartum period; sports, especially soccer; pelvic malignancy; and intravenous drug abuse. the most often  identified microorganisms were staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.  osteomyelitis complicates the majority of cases, and about half of the patients require surgical debridement along with a prolonged antibiotic treatment. we report a case of streptococcus anginosus septic arthritis of the pubic symphysis. the patient did not have any of the above risk factors.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of abrus precatorius (l) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. method: in this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, three clinical s. aureus isolates from different sources, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus anginosus (s.milleri), bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), escherichia coli atcc 25922, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. to measure the mic values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. result: at the  different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an mic of 8 ug/ml for  the leaf extract. extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of  the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans but not against s anginosus, e. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. the ph of the extracts ranged between ph5 and ph8. this study demonstrates that abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. conclusion: the results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of abrus precatorius for the treatment of  various bacteria-related diseases. topical application of abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == subdural empyema.
AB  == subdural empyema represents loculated infection between the outermost layer of the meninges, the dura, and the arachnoid. the empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. the most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in  particular those of the streptococcus milleri group (s. milleri and streptococcus anginosus). staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including gram-negative organisms, such as escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as bacteroides, may be present. pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced aids; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by s. aureus. subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical  and neurosurgical emergency. the diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial  and spinal subdural empyema is mri with gadolinium enhancement. computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by mri. conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by ct myelography where mri is negative. treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against s. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and gram-negative organisms. antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against s. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. morbidity and mortality in intracranial and  spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency.

TI  == cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  == cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to escherichia coli (two bacteremic), pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae, or streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were  clinically cured, but one relapse (s. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. six patients with cystitis due to e. coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, p. aeruginosa, or s. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both,  occurred in five due to p. aeruginosa, s. faecalis, c. fruendii, or e. coli. neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to hemophilus influenzae, s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, or neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but p. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. eight soft tissue infections due to staphylococcus aureus, peptococcus prevotti,  streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to s. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for s. aureus occurred in one. granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. possible side effects require further study.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of ceftizoxime in the pediatric infections (author's transl)].
AB  == ceftizoxime (fk 749, czx) was evaluated in 24 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. of the 17 confirmed bacterial infections, 16 were shown to be effective (effective rate, 94.1%). the diagnosis included acute pharyngitis (2), pneumonia (6), staphylococcal empyema (1), cervical purulent lymphadenitis (2), acute enterocolitis (2), acute pyelonephritis (1), ssss (1) and suspected septicemia (2). the etiological pathogens recovered were streptococcus anginosus  (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (2), haemophilus influenzae (3), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (1) etc. a case of suspected pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia was not effectively treated with czx. the serum half-life of czx was 1.36 hours after intravenous bolus infection. a cerebrospinal fluid level of czx was 6.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous bolus injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. no severe adverse reaction was encountered with the czx therapy. the data suggest that czx  is an excellent candidate for the first choice parenteral antibiotic in the pediatric infections.
