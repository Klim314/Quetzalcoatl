TI  == evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of bacteroides, prevotella and fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the n. n. blokhin cancer research center, moscow, russia.
AB  == in total 122 non-duplicate bacteroides, prevotella and fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. most of the strains belonged to the b. fragilis group (55%), followed by prevotella strains (34.4%) and fusobacterium spp (10.6%). the species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. the most common isolates were b. fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b.  ovatus and b. vulgatus. among prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were p. buccae, p. buccalis, p. oris, p. denticola and p. nigrescens, and most of the fusobacterium spp. were f. nucleatum. susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the e-test methodology. the percentage of the susceptibility of b. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (mic </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (mic </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (mic </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (mic </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. three b. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). all prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (mic >0.5 mug/ml). the susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. all fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.

TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == anaerobic gram-negative bacilli
AB  == at present there are over two dozen genera of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli. in most clinical infections, only the genera bacteroides, prevotella, and fusobacterium need be considered. these genera are prevalent in the body as members of the normal flora (fig.20-1), constituting one-third of the total anaerobic isolates from clinical specimens, and may become involved in infections throughout the body (fig.20-2). within the bacteroides group, b fragilis is the most common pathogen, followed by b thetaiotaomicron and other members of the b fragilis group. among the bile-sensitive prevotella species, the ones most commonly encountered clinically are p melaninogenica, p oris, and p buccae. porphyromonas species seem to be much less pathogenic except in dental infections. fusobacterium nucleatum is the fusobacterium species most often found as a pathogen, but f necrophorum occasionally produces serious disease. these genera contain numerous other species that rarely or never infect humans.

TI  == genetic relationships within the genus prevotella analyzed by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == the genetic diversity and relationships within the genus prevotella were studied  by analyzing twenty-five strains by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mlee) at nine metabolic enzyme loci and dna-dna hybridization. mlee revealed a high genetic diversity with 25 electrophoretic types (ets) for the 25 strains studied, a mean number of alleles per enzyme locus of 6.8 and a mean genetic diversity per locus of 0.786. the index of association described by maynard smith et al. (1993) revealed a clonal structure within the genus prevotella. a dendrogram generated by cluster analysis of a matrix of ets showed that species like p. bivia, p. buccae, p. oris, p. oralis, p. nigrescens, and p. denticola form clusters that are consistent with dna homologies. however, strains identified as p. melaninogenica or p. loescheii by dna-dna hybridization did not constitute distinct subpopulations in mlee. mlee analysis demonstrated its high power in differentiating closely related strains. it provides an alternative to 16s rrna analysis for the study of phylogenetic relationships within the genus prevotella, especially for differentiating strains with high dna homology or high rrna homology.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == fibronectin and laminin binding of urogenital and oral prevotella species.
AB  == 88 strains of five prevotella species--p. bivia, p. buccae, p. disiens, p. oralis, and p. oris--were examined for their fibronectin and laminin binding properties with the aid of latex particle agglutination assays. beside single protein binding activities, all species showed strains that adhered to both fibronectin and laminin. the oral species, p. buccae, p. oralis, and p. oris were found to interact with laminin to a pronouncedly higher extent than with fibronectin. the urogenital species, p. bivia and p. disiens showed comparable activities of binding to fibronectin and laminin, with p. bivia exhibiting higher matrix protein binding rates than p. disiens. within the oral species group, p. oralis showed a higher percentage of fibronectin and laminin reactive strains than did p. buccae and p. oris. the finding of species-related different binding  properties may throw some light on the known differences in clinical relevance and pathogenicity of the urogenital species, p. bivia and p. disiens, but does so only in part concerning the oral species, p. buccae, p. oralis, and p. oris. moreover, the observed differences in matrix protein binding of prevotella species may have implications in chemotaxis and opsonization on the one hand and  maintenance of colonization activities under antibiotic therapy on the other.

TI  == inhibition of prevotella and capnocytophaga immunoglobulin a1 proteases by human  serum.
AB  == oral prevotella and capnocytophaga species, regularly isolated from periodontal pockets and associated with extraoral infections, secret specific immunoglobulin  a1 (iga1) proteases cleaving human iga1 in the hinge region into intact fab and fc fragments. to investigate whether these enzymes are subject to inhibition in vivo in humans, we tested 34 sera from periodontally diseased and healthy individuals in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence and titers of inhibition of seven prevotella and capnocytophaga proteases. all or nearly all of the sera inhibited the iga1 protease activity of prevotella buccae, prevotella oris, and prevotella loescheii. a minor proportion of the sera inhibited prevotella buccalis, prevotella denticola, and prevotella melaninogenica iga1 proteases, while no sera inhibited capnocytophaga ochracea iga1 protease. all inhibition titers were low, ranging from 5 to 55, with titer being defined as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum causing 50% inhibition of one defined unit of protease activity. no correlation between periodontal disease status and the presence, absence, or titer of inhibition was observed. the nature of the low titers of inhibition in all sera of the iga1 proteases of p. buccae, p. oris, and p. loescheii was further examined. in size exclusion chromatography, inhibitory activity corresponded to the peak volume of iga. additional inhibition of the p.  oris iga1 protease was found in fractions containing both iga and igg. purification of the igg fractions of five sera by passage of the sera on a protein g column resulted in recovery of inhibitory igg antibodies against all three iga1 proteases, with the highest titer being for the p. oris enzyme. these  finding indicate that inhibitory activity is associated with enzyme-neutralizing  antibodies.

TI  == bilophila wadsworthiain brain abscess: case report.
AB  == a case of a patient with a 20-year history of chronic otitis media complicated by cholesteatoma and brain abscess is described. a ct scan with contrast material showed three abscess cavities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. a culture from  a specimen of the cholesteatoma yielded a significant amount of growth of bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella oris and a moderate growth of alpha-streptococci and staphylococcus simulans. from the pus of the brain abscess we also isolated numerous bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella oris and some prevotella buccae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. no aerobes were present. the patient underwent a craniotomy and the biggest abscess was removed together with the capsule. the antimicrobial therapy  included penicillin plus metronidazole and later augmentin. the result of the treatment was a complete cure and total recovery of the patient. this is the first documentation of isolation of b. wadsworthia in chronic otitis media and in brain abscess.

TI  == a retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the wadsworth anaerobic bacteriology clinical research laboratory (los angeles). anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. a total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. the most common isolates were as follows: fusobacterium nucleatum (19); prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were p. oris); bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were b. fragilis); pigmented prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were peptostreptococcus micros); eubacterium species (7); lactobacillus species (8); actinomyces species (7); and  clostridium species (7). nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: f. nucleatum (five cases); b. fragilis (two cases); and prevotella mangus (one case). of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group d nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. the susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of  these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (mics ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/ml vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/ml for beta-lactamase-negative strains).

TI  == identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == a pyrolysis mass spectrometry study of the non-pigmented prevotella species.
AB  == collection strains (21) and non-pigmented clinical isolates (96) provisionally identified as prevotella spp. were classified numerically on the basis of pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) data and reaction patterns in conventional tests (ctrps) for volatile and non-volatile fatty acids, pre-formed enzymes and biochemical activity. pms and ctrp classifications were compared with a previous  classification based on visual analysis of sds-page patterns. although the order  of clusters differed, cross-tabulation of cluster membership revealed strong correlations between classifications. cluster membership in the pms classification correlated particularly well with sds-page results. ctrp clusters  corresponded largely to the recognised species of prevotella, but pms and sds-page divided two species into sub-groups: two in p. buccae and five in p. veroralis. the latter subgroups could be discriminated by small but consistent differences in ctrps. an undesignated, well differentiated cluster of strains appeared closest to the main group of p. buccae strains in pms and ctrps. b. (p.) capillus could not be distinguished from p. buccae; these species are regarded as synonymous. strains of p. zoogleoformans and b. (p.) pentosaceus were well separated from other strains in pms. a complex comprising clusters of p. disiens, p. oralis, p. veroralis, p. loescheii and a further undesignated group similar to p. melaninogenica was well differentiated from p. buccae and p. oris in pms; clusters corresponding to p. bivia, p. corporis, p. intermedia and p. denticola formed another complex.

TI  == characterisation of non-pigmented species of the genus prevotella by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == gram-negative anaerobic bacilli previously known as the melaninogenicus-oralis group of bacteroides have been assigned to a new genus, prevotella. the non-pigmented members of this genus share several general characteristics and cannot be readily distinguished by routine tests. a polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis procedure, with visual analysis of protein patterns, was used to  compare cellular protein patterns from clinical isolates with those from collection (reference) strains. reference strains of p. oralis, p. veroralis, p.  buccalis, p. oris, p. buccae, p. zoogleoformans, p. bivia, p. disiens, p. oulora, b. (p.) capillus and b. (p.) pentosaceus, and 91 non-pigmented isolates from patients with adult periodontal disease were examined by conventional biochemical tests, gas-liquid chromatography (glc) and enzyme tests, and whole-cell protein profiles were obtained by sds-page. there was close correlation between patterns  of results in biochemical and glc tests and the sds-page profiles, and the species were readily distinguished in sds-page. the periodontal isolates were assigned to 10 groups by conventional test reaction patterns and nine groups by sds-page; the profiles of 79 isolates corresponded to those of seven species reference strains. by sds-page, clinical isolates of p. buccae (42 isolates) and  p. oralis (eight isolates) showed good similarity with reference strains. however, for p. veroralis (15), p. oris (7), p. bivia (4), p. zoogleoformans (2)  and p. buccalis (1), clinical isolates showed some minor variations from reference strains. twelve isolates remained undesignated in sds-page analysis. variant sds-page profiles divided clinical isolates of p. buccae into two subgroups and those of p. veroralis into five subgroups.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == multivariate analyses of fatty acid data from whole-cell methanolysates of prevotella, bacteroides and porphyromonas spp.
AB  == the genus bacteroides contains a number of biochemically and physiologically heterogeneous groups of organisms and needs taxonomic revision. in this study cellular fatty acids from a number of bacteroides spp. were identified and quantified using gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. the chemical data were then subjected to principal components analysis. in b. fragilis, which is the type species of the genus bacteroides, c3-oh-iso17 was the predominant fatty acid (38.0%) and cante15 was present in higher amounts (32.7%)  than ciso15 (14.6%). b. fragilis thus differed from all the other species examined: prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, p. (b.) oralis, p. (b.) oris, p. (b.)  disiens, p. (b.) veroralis, p. (b.) heparinolytica and porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis. principal components analysis also enabled the closely related p. buccae, p. oralis and p. oris to be differentiated.

TI  == multivariate analyses of cellular fatty acids in bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, wolinella, and campylobacter spp.
AB  == the genera bacteroides, wolinella, and campylobacter contain several similar species that require taxonomic revision. fatty acid profiles of whole bacterial cells have proven useful for taxonomy. in this study, cellular fatty acids from bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, wolinella, and campylobacter spp. were identified and quantitated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the data were subjected to principal component analyses. bacteroides fragilis, the type species of the genus bacteroides, was distinct from the other organisms. while bacteroides gracilis, wolinella succinogenes, wolinella curva, wolinella recta, and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis were  close to each other, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella oris, prevotella disiens, prevotella veroralis, prevotella heparinolyticus, porphyromonas (bacteroides) endodontalis, and bacteroides ureolyticus could be distinguished. b. fragilis was characterized by the presence of c3oh-i-1-, ca-15, and ci-15 and the absence of c12:0 and unsaturated fatty acids. for comparison, b. gracilis, b. ureolyticus, w. succinogenes, w. curva, w. recta, and campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis contained c12:0, c16:1, c18:1, and c3-oh-14 acids but lacked branched hydroxy and branched nonhydroxy acids. b.  gracilis and b. ureolyticus are not "true" bacteroides.

TI  == the use of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of bacteroides intermedius isolates in a dot blot assay.
AB  == bacteroides intermedius includes two distinct groups of organisms that are phenotypically indistinguishable by conventional methods. these two groups are represented by the type strain of the species atcc 25611t (b. intermedius type i) and by atcc 33563 (b. intermedius type ii). members of each group can be distinguished from each other by analysis of the cellular protein composition by  sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and by dna-dna homology studies, because they share less than 40% homology. the purpose of this study was to prepare specific dna probes for the two groups of bacteroides intermedius and  to test them against field isolates. whole-cell dna probes were prepared from b.  intermedius types i and ii and tested against 253 field strains of bacteroides which had been identified by conventional phenotypic tests as b. intermedius. of  these, 170 (67%) hybridized with the b. intermedius type i dna probe, 28 (11%) with the type ii, and 23 (9%) failed to react with the b. intermedius probes but  did hybridize with either b. melaninogenicus, b. loescheii, or b. corporis whole-cell dna probes. the 32 (13%) remaining isolates failed to hybridize with any of the five bacteroides probes or with probes to b. asaccharolyticus, b. buccae, b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. gingivalis, b. oralis, or b. oris. these data demonstrate the usefulness of whole-cell dna probes for the identification of phenotypically similar or identical field isolates.

TI  == use of the rapid-ana system to screen for enzyme activities that differ among species of bile-inhibited bacteroides.
AB  == the rapid-ana system (innovative diagnostics systems, inc., atlanta, ga.) was used to test 102 strains of 14 species of phenotypically similar bile-inhibited bacteroides from humans. bacteroides oris, bacteroides veroralis, bacteroides buccalis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, and bacteroides denticola had very similar enzyme activity profiles. clear differentiation of these six species by the rapid-ana system was not possible, but tests for arginine aminopeptidase and beta-glucosidase were helpful. bacteroides oralis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, and bacteroides buccae each had unique enzyme activity profiles. no consistent differences in enzyme activities were found between the two dna homology groups within bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides loescheii, or bacteroides intermedius. tests for glycine aminopeptidase, alpha-galactosidase, arginine aminopeptidase, alpha-fucosidase, n-acetylglucosaminidase, reduction of triphenyltetrazolium, and production of indole were helpful in the differentiation of the species studied.
