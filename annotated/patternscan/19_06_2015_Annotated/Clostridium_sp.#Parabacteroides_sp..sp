TI  == genome sequence determination and metagenomic characterization of a dehalococcoides mixed culture grown on cis-1,2-dichloroethene.
AB  == a dehalococcoides-containing bacterial consortium that performed dechlorination of 0.20 mm cis-1,2-dichloroethene to ethene in 14 days was obtained from the sediment mud of the lotus field. to obtain detailed information of the consortium, the metagenome was analyzed using the short-read next-generation sequencer solid 3. matching the obtained sequence tags with the reference genome  sequences indicated that the dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium was highly homologous to dehalococcoides mccartyi cbdb1 and bav1. sequence comparison with the reference sequence constructed from 16s rrna gene sequences in a public database showed the presence of sedimentibacter, sulfurospirillum, clostridium, desulfovibrio, parabacteroides, alistipes, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus and proteocatella in addition to dehalococcoides sp. after further enrichment, the members of the consortium were narrowed down to almost three species. finally, the full-length circular genome sequence of the dehalococcoides sp. in the consortium, d. mccartyi ibaraki, was determined by analyzing the metagenome with  the single-molecule dna sequencer pacbio rs. the accuracy of the sequence was confirmed by matching it to the tag sequences obtained by solid 3. the genome is  1,451,062 nt and the number of cds is 1566, which includes 3 rrna genes and 47 trna genes. there exist twenty-eight rdase genes that are accompanied by the genes for anchor proteins. the genome exhibits significant sequence identity with other dehalococcoides spp. throughout the genome, but there exists significant difference in the distribution rdase genes. the combination of a short-read next-generation dna sequencer and a long-read single-molecule dna sequencer gives detailed information of a bacterial consortium.

TI  == freezing/thawing pretreatment coupled with biological process of thermophilic geobacillus sp. g1: acceleration on waste activated sludge hydrolysis and acidification.
AB  == a novel pretreatment method combining freezing/thawing with geobacillus sp. g1 was employed to pretreat waste activated sludge (was) for enhancing the was hydrolysis and subsequent short-chain fatty acids (scfas) production. results showed that freezing/thawing combined with geobacillus sp. g1 pretreatment achieved the maximal concentrations of soluble protein from 40+/-6mg cod/l (non-pretreated) to 1226+/-24mg cod/l (pretreated), and accumulated scfas concentration increased from 248+/-81mg cod/l to 3032+/-53mg cod/l. excitation emission matrix (eem) fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the highest fluorescence intensity (fi) of protein-like substances, which was the dominant fluorescent organic matters, indicating the synergistic effect of freezing/thawing and geobacillus sp. g1 pretreatment on organics hydrolysis. high-throughput pyrosequencing analysis investigated that the abundance of bacteria responsible for was hydrolysis (such as clostridium and caloramator) and scfas production (such as parabacteroides and bacterodies) was greatly enhanced due to the novel pretreatment method used.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from mouse caecal samples and description of bacteroides sartorii sp. nov.
AB  == caecal samples from wild-type and tnf(deltaare) mice were cultured on selective media containing bile salts, amino acids or casein macro-peptides. twenty-two strains were isolated and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. twenty-one strains showed >98% similarity to known bacteria (blautia spp., clostridium innocuum, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus murinus, parabacteroides goldsteinii and shigella dysenteriae). one additional isolate, strain a-c2-0, was a new bacterium. the closest relatives were bacteroides massiliensis, bacteroides dorei and bacteroides vulgatus (< or = 94% similarity). strain a-c2-0 is a gram-negative rod that does not form spores and has a g + c content of dna of 41.5%. its major cellular fatty acid is c(15:0 anteiso), and its major respiratory quinone is mk-9. cells are aerotolerant but grow only under strict anoxic conditions. they are resistant to cefotaxime and tobramycin. when compared with related bacteroides spp., the new bacterium was positive for alpha-arabinosidase, negative for glutamyl glutamic acid arylamidase and did not  metabolise galactose, glucose, fructose, mannose, raffinose and sucrose. strain a-c2-0 therefore merits recognition as a member of a novel species within the genus bacteroides, for which the name bacteroides sartorii is proposed. the type  strain is a-c2-0(t) (= dsm 21941(t) = ccug 57211(t)).
