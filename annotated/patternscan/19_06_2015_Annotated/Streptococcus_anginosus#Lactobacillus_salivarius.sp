TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == oral bacteria in biofilms exhibit slow reactivation from nutrient deprivation.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to enter a non-growing state is believed to be an important mechanism for survival in the starved micro-environments of the oral cavity. in this study, we examined the reactivation of nutrient-deprived cells of two oral bacteria in biofilms, streptococcus anginosus and lactobacillus salivarius. non-growing cells were generated by incubation in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer for 24 h and the results were compared to those of planktonic cultures. when both types of cells were shifted from a rich, peptone-yeast extract-glucose (pyg) medium to buffer for 24 h, dehydrogenase and esterase activity measured by the fluorescent dyes 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl-tetrazolium chloride (ctc) and fluorescein diacetate (fda), respectively, was absent in both  species. however, the membranes of the vast majority of nutrient-deprived cells remained intact as assessed by live/dead staining. metabolic reactivation of the  nutrient-deprived biofilm cells was not observed for at least 48 h following addition of fresh pyg medium, whereas the non-growing planktonic cultures of the  same two strains were in rapid growth in less than 2 h. at 72 h, the s. anginosus biofilm cells had recovered 78 % of the dehydrogenase activity and 61 % of the esterase activity and the biomass mm(-2) had increased by 30-35 %. with l. salivarius at 72 h, the biofilms had recovered 56 % and 75 % of dehydrogenase and esterase activity, respectively. reactivation of both species in biofilms was enhanced by removal of glucose from pyg, and s. anginosus cells were particularly responsive to yeast extract (ye) medium. the data suggest that the low reactivity of non-growing biofilm cells to the introduction of fresh nutrients may be a survival strategy employed by micro-organisms in the oral cavity.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
