TI  == antimicrobial activity of enterocins from enterococcus faecalis sl-5 against propionibacterium acnes, the causative agent in acne vulgaris, and its therapeutic effect.
AB  == a lactic acid bacterial strain was isolated from human fecal specimen and identified as enterococcus faecalis sl-5. the isolated strain showed antimicrobial activity against gram-positive pathogens assayed, especially the highest activity against propionibacterium acnes. the antimicrobial substance was purified and verified as a bacteriocin (named esl5) of e. faecalis sl-5 by activity-staining using p. acnes as an indicator. n-terminal sequence of esl5 was determined (mgaiaklvak) and sequence analysis revealed that it is almost identical to the some of enterocins including l50a/b of e. faecium l50 and mr10a/b of e. faecalis mrr 10-3. from the sequencing data of l50a/b structural genes, the nucleotide sequence showed 100% identity with that of the mr10a/b structural genes, implying that esl5 is an equivalent of enterocin mr10. meanwhile, we also tested the therapeutic effect of anti-p. acnes activity in patients with mild to moderate acne because of its pathogenic role to acne vulgaris. for this purpose, a concentrated powder of cbt sl-5 was prepared using  cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of e. faecalis sl-5 and included in a lotion for application in the patients. the study showed that cbt sl-5 lotion significantly reduced the inflammatory lesions like pustules compared to the placebo lotion. therefore our results indicate that the anti-p. acnes activity produced by e. faecalis sl-5 has potential role to the treatment of acne as an alternative to topical antibiotics.

TI  == effectiveness of the antibiotic lock therapy for the treatment of port-related enterococci, gram-negative, or gram-positive bacilli bloodstream infections.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic lock therapy to treat port-related enterococci, gram-negative, or gram-positive bacilli bloodstream infections. patients and methods: we conducted a prospective  observational study including all patients with port-related bacteremia diagnosed at the clinica universitaria de navarra, pamplona, spain. during a 36-month period, 110 patients were diagnosed with port-related bacteremia. of these patients, 18 met criteria to be enrolled in the study. they were treated with a combination of systemic and antibiotic lock therapy (12-24 h/day during 7-14 days). treatment effectiveness was assessed by clinical and microbiologic criteria. results: treatment was associated with clinical and microbiologic success in 88.8% of our patients (2/2 of the propionibacterium acnes, 5/5 of the  corynebacterium spp., 6/7 of the gram-negative bacillus, and 3/4 of the enterococcus faecium port-related bloodstream infections). mean increase of port  life span for all patients after bacteremia was 288 days (range, 0-1403 days). conclusion: antibiotic lock therapy combined with systemic antibiotics appears to be a safe and effective treatment of port-related bacteremia caused by enterococci, gram-negative, or gram-positive bacilli if the patient is stable and no septic syndrome is associated.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == [bacteremia in intra-arterial angiography, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty  and percutaneous transhepatic cholangio-drainage].
AB  == purpose: prospective evaluation of the rate of bacteremia attributed to invasive  radiological techniques. methods: aerobic and anerobic blood cultures were obtained in 100 patients (62 men, 38 women; mean age 65 +/- 14 years) undergoing  intra-arterial angiography (n = 50), pta (n = 30) or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (ptcd; n = 20). samples were taken before the treatment (t0), immediately after puncture of the vessel or bile duct (t2), and 30 min after the  termination of the procedure (t3). results: the overall rate of bacteremia was 18%. during diagnostic angiography a 16% rate of temporary bacteremia (no positive t3 samples) was observed. during pta the rate was 27% (no clinically significant infectious disease) and during ptcd the rate was 10% (5% cholangitis  with septicemia). we isolated staphylococci (s. epidermidis: n = 7, s. species: n = 3, s. aureus: n = 1), streptococci (n = 2), propionibacterium acnes (n = 5), e. coli (n = 1), enterococcus faecium (n = 1), enterobacter species (n = 1), and clostridium perfringens (n = 1). apart from the one patient with cholangitis no clinical infectious complication occurred. conclusion: temporary bacteremia is rather frequent during invasive radiological procedures. strictly aseptic conditions and antibiotic prophylaxis, specially in case of implantation of a permanent foreign body, is warranted.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
