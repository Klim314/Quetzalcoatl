TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene for cellobiose 2-epimerase from a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens.
AB  - Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE; EC 5.1.3.11) is known to catalyze the reversible epimerization of cellobiose to 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannose in Ruminococcus albus cells. Here, we report a CE in a ruminal strain of Eubacterium cellulosolvens for the first time. The nucleotide sequence of the CE had an ORF of 1218 bp (405 amino acids; 46 963.3 Da). The CE from E. cellulosolvens showed 44-54% identity to N-acyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase-like hypothetical proteins in the genomes of Coprococcus eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium phytofermentans, Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, and Eubacterium siraeum. Surprisingly, it exhibited only 46% identity to a CE from R. albus. The recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was purified by two-step chromatography. The purified enzyme had a molecular mass of 46.7 kDa and exhibited optimal activity at around 35 degrees C and pH 7.0-8.5. In addition to cello-oligosaccharides, it converted lactose to epilactose (4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-D-mannose).
