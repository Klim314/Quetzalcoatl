TI  == catalase-positive cocci in fermented sausage: variability due to different pork breeds, breeding systems and sausage production technology.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the ecology of catalase-positive cocci (cpc) present in traditional fermented sausages produced using different breeds of pork, each of which was raised in two different environments and processed using  two different technologies. semi-quantitative molecular methods were used to determine bacterial identities. almost all fermentations were characterised by a  significant increase in cpc during the first few days of fermentation, reaching values of 10(5)-10(6) cfu g(-1) within 3 days. staphylococcus xylosus and staphylococcus equorum species, which were detected over the course of fermentation, were found to be the predominant population in all the monitored fermentation. staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, micrococcus luteus, macrococcus caseolyticus and staphylococcus succinus were also present, but their concentrations were found to vary under the different experimental conditions. using cluster analysis, we concluded that a plant-specific cpc ecology existed. in addition, the breed of pork used for production was found to  influence the presence of some cpc species. however, from this study, it was not  possible to reach the same conclusion regarding the breeding system used.

TI  == microbial contamination of orthodontic buccal tubes from manufacturers.
AB  == this study aimed to test the sterility of new unused orthodontic buccal tubes received from manufacturers. four different types of buccal tubes were used straight from the manufactures package without any additional sterilizing step. of these buccal tubes tested, three genera of bacteria, implicated as opportunistic pathogens, namely micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus haemolyticus and acinetobacter calcoaceticus were recovered from these buccal tubes. our data  showing microbial contamination on buccal tubes highlights the need of sterilization before clinical use. we also suggest that manufacturers should list the sterility state of orthodontic buccal tubes on their packaging or instructions stating the need for sterilization.

TI  == rapid differentiation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci and meticillin susceptibility testing directly from growth-positive blood cultures by multiplex real-time pcr.
AB  == this study evaluated a multiplex real-time pcr method specific for the meca, fema-sa and fema-se genes for rapid identification of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and non-s. epidermidis coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and meticillin susceptibility testing directly in positive  blood cultures that grew gram-positive cocci in clusters. a total of 100 positive blood cultures produced: 39 s. aureus [12 meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa),  31% of all the s. aureus]; 30 s. epidermidis (56.6% of the cons), 8 staphylococcus capitis (15.1%), 3 staphylococcus saprophyticus (5.7%), 4 staphylococcus hominis (7.5%), 3 staphylococcus haemolyticus (5.7%), 2 staphylococcus warneri (3.8%), 1 staphylococcus cohnii (1.9%) and 2 unidentified  staphylococcus spp. (3.8%); and 1 micrococcus luteus in pure culture. two blood cultures had no growth on subculture and five blood cultures grew mixed cons. for the 95 blood cultures with pure growth or no growth on subculture, there was very good agreement between real-time pcr and the bd phoenix identification system for staphylococcal species categorization in s. aureus, s. epidermidis and non-s. epidermidis cons and meticillin-resistance determination (cohen's unweighted kappa coefficient kappa=0.882). all mrsa and meticillin-susceptible s. aureus were correctly identified by meca amplification. pcr amplification of meca was more sensitive for direct detection of meticillin-resistant cons in positive blood cultures than testing with the bd phoenix system. there were no major errors when identifying staphylococcal isolates and their meticillin susceptibility within 2.5 h. further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical  benefit of using such a rapid test on the consumption of glycopeptide antibiotics and the alteration of empiric therapy in the situation of positive blood cultures growing staphylococci, and the respective clinical outcomes.

TI  == microbiological investigations on cryopreserved human semen.
AB  == primary mycological contamination was studied in 565 random human ejaculates. after sperm preservation at low temperature, secondary mycological contamination  of 55 of the ejaculates was investigated. 25 ejaculates were cryopreserved with and without antibiotics and examined bacteriologically before and after different phases of cryopreservation. furthermore, semen samples of several donors were inoculated with suspensions of different concentrations of yeasts and with the test bacteria escherichia coli k 12 and staphylococcus aureus sg 511. microbiological results were then compared before and after cryopreservation. the following results were obtained: 1.9.8% of samples showed primary mycological contamination (1.9% with candida albicans). 2. cryopreservation reduced the concentration of fungi by more than 90% on average. 3. only one semen sample was  contaminated with bacteria (staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus and streptococcus  nonhaemolyticus). non-pathogenic bacteria were found in 11 ejaculates (micrococcus luteus in 5 samples and staphylococcus epidermidis in 6 samples), and contamination was largely unaffected by cryopreservation, even in the presence of antibiotics. 4. test bacteria inoculated into semen were not influenced by the addition of antibiotics to the cryoprotective medium.

TI  == temporal study of the staphylococci and micrococci of normal infant skin.
AB  == staphylococcus and micrococcus populations were collected from the healthy skin of 10 infant subjects. infants were sampled from 1 day to 32 weeks of age. species were characterized by approximately 30 different morphological, physiological, and biochemical characters. staphylococci were the predominant inhabitants of normal skin, whereas micrococci were found only occasionally in this environment. staphylococcus epidermidid, s. haemolyticus, and s. hominis were the predominant and persistent staphylococci. these species constituted a high percentage of the total aerobic bacterial flora of infant skin. micrococcus  luteus and m. kristinae were the prevalent micrococci found on infant skin. only  limited correlation between staphyloccus and micrococcus populations and infant age or body area sampled was indicated by this study.

TI  == preliminary studies on the characterization and distribution of staphylococcus and micrococcus species on animal skin.
AB  == a total of 221 strains of staphylococci and 98 strains of micrococci isolated from the skins of eastern gray squirrels, southern flying squirrels, raccoons, opossums, squirrel monkeys, swine, sheep, horses, cattle, and dogs were characterized in a preliminary attempt to resolve their natural relationships and distribution in nature. staphylococci demonstrating the widest host range included staphylococcus xylosus and unnamed staphylococcus sp. 3. unnamed staphylococcus sp. 2 was isolated only from sheep, staphylococcus sp. 4 only from opossums, staphylococcus sp. 5 only from squirrel monkeys, and staphylococcus sp. 6 only from swine. the predominant species isolated from human skin, including s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. haemolyticus, and s. capitis, were either not isolated or only rarely isolated from animal skin. micrococcus varians was the predominant micrococcus species isolated from animal skin. m. luteus was only occasionally isolated. m. lylae, m. sedentarius, m. roseus, m. kristinae, and m.  nishinomiyaensis, species occasionally isolated from human skin, were not isolated from animal skin.

TI  == distribution and persistence of staphylococcus and micrococcus species and other  aerobic bacteria on human skin.
AB  == the districution of staphylococcus and micrococcus species and associated coryneform bacteria, acinetobacter, klebsiella, enterobacter, bacillus, and streptomyces on skin was determined during october 1971 from samples collected on persons living in north carolina and new jersey. persistence of these organisms on skin was estimated in temporal studies conducted during the period from june 1971 to june 1972 on persons living in north carolina. staphylococci and coryneforms were the most predominant and persistent bacteria isolated from the nares and axillae. staphylococci, coryneforms, micrococci, and bacillus were the  most predominant and persistent bacteria isolated from the head, legs, and arms.  acinetobacters were most frequently isolated during the warmer months of the years. staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were the most predominant and persistent staphylococci isolated from the nares, whereas s. epidermidis and s. hominis were the most predominant and persistent staphylocicci isolated from the  axillae, head, legs, and arms. s. capitis was often isolated from the head and arms and s. haemolyticus was often isolated from the head, legs, and arms. s. simulans, s. xylosus, s. cohnii, s. saprophyticus, s. warneri, and an unclassified coagulase-positive species were only occasionally isolated from skin. micrococcus luteus was the most predominant and persistent micrococcus isolated from skin and preferred regions of the head, legs, and arms. m. varians  was the second most frequent micrococcus isolated. m. lylae, m. sedentarius, m. roseus, m. kristinae, and m. nishinomiyaensis were only occasionally isolated from skin. m. lylae was most frequently isolated during the colder months of the  years.
