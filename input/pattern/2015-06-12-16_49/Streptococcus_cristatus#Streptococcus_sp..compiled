TI  - Comparison of species identification of endocarditis associated viridans streptococci using rnpB genotyping and 2 MALDI-TOF systems.
AB  - Streptococcus spp. are important causes of infective endocarditis but challenging in species identification. This study compared identification based on sequence determination of the rnpB gene with 2 systems of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, MALDI Biotyper (Bruker) and VITEK MS IVD (bioMerieux). Blood culture isolates of viridans streptococci from 63 patients with infective endocarditis were tested. The 3 methods showed full agreement for all 36 isolates identified in the Anginosus, Bovis, and Mutans groups or identified as Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, or Streptococcus sanguinis. None of the methods could reliably identify the 23 isolates to the species level when designated as Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, or Streptococcus tigurinus. In 7 isolates classified to the Mitis group, the rnpB sequences deviated strikingly from all reference sequences, and additional analysis of sodA and groEL genes indicated the occurrence of yet unidentified Streptococcus spp.
TI  - A YadA-like autotransporter, Hag1 in Veillonella atypica is a multivalent hemagglutinin involved in adherence to oral streptococci, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and human oral buccal cells.
AB  - Dental biofilm development is a sequential process, and adherence between microbes and the salivary pellicle (adhesion) as well as among different microbes (co-adhesion or coaggregation) plays a critical role in building a biofilm community. The Veillonella species are among the most predominant species in the oral cavity and coaggregate with many initial, early, middle, and late colonizers. Similar to oral fusobacteria, they are also considered bridging species in biofilm development. However, the mechanism of this ability has yet to be reported, due to the previous lack of a genetic transformation system in the entire genus. In this study, we used our recently discovered transformable Veillonella strain, Veillonella atypica OK5, to probe the mechanism of coaggregation between Veillonella species and other oral bacteria. By insertional inactivation of all eight putative hemagglutinin genes, we identified one gene, hag1, which is involved in V. atypica coaggregation with the initial colonizers Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus cristatus, and the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. The hag1 mutant also abolished adherence to human buccal cells. Inhibition assays using various chemical or physiological treatments suggest different mechanisms being involved in coaggregation with different partners. The entire hag1 gene was sequenced and shown to be the largest known bacterial hemagglutinin gene.
TI  - Phylogenomic and MALDI-TOF MS analysis of Streptococcus sinensis HKU4T reveals a  distinct phylogenetic clade in the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Streptococcus sinensis is a recently discovered human pathogen isolated from blood cultures of patients with infective endocarditis. Its phylogenetic position, as well as those of its closely related species, remains inconclusive when single genes were used for phylogenetic analysis. For example, S. sinensis branched out from members of the anginosus, mitis, and sanguinis groups in the 16S ribosomal RNA gene phylogenetic tree, but it was clustered with members of the anginosus and sanguinis groups when groEL gene sequences used for analysis. In this study, we sequenced the draft genome of S. sinensis and used a polyphasic approach, including concatenated genes, whole genomes, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to analyze the phylogeny of S. sinensis. The size of the S. sinensis draft genome is 2.06 Mb, with GC content of 42.2%. Phylogenetic analysis using 50 concatenated genes or whole genomes revealed that S. sinensis formed a distinct cluster with Streptococcus oligofermentans and Streptococcus cristatus, and these three streptococci were clustered with the "sanguinis group." As for phylogenetic analysis using hierarchical cluster analysis of the mass spectra of streptococci, S. sinensis also formed a distinct cluster with S. oligofermentans and S. cristatus, but these three streptococci were clustered with the "mitis group." On the basis of the findings, we propose a novel group, named "sinensis group," to include S. sinensis, S. oligofermentans, and S. cristatus, in the Streptococcus genus. Our study also illustrates the power of phylogenomic analyses for resolving ambiguities in bacterial taxonomy.
TI  - Heat-stable molecule derived from Streptococcus cristatus induces APOBEC3 expression and inhibits HIV-1 replication.
AB  - Although most human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cases worldwide are transmitted through mucosal surfaces, transmission through the oral mucosal surface is a rare event. More than 700 bacterial species have been detected in the oral cavity. Despite great efforts to discover oral inhibitors of HIV, little information is available concerning the anti-HIV activity of oral bacterial components. Here we show that a molecule from an oral commensal bacterium, Streptococcus cristatus CC5A can induce expression of APOBEC3G (A3G) and APOBEC3F (A3F) and inhibit HIV-1 replication in THP-1 cells. We show by qRT-PCR that expression levels of A3G and A3F increase in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of a CC5A extract, as does A3G protein levels by Western blot assay. In addition, when the human monocytic cell line THP-1 was treated with CC5A extract, the replication of HIV-1 IIIB was significantly suppressed compared with IIIB replication in untreated THP-1 cells. Knock down of A3G expression in THP-1 cells compromised the ability of CC5A to inhibit HIV-1 IIIB infectivity. Furthermore, SupT1 cells infected with virus produced from CC5A extract-treated THP-1 cells replicated virus with a higher G to A hypermutation rate (a known consequence of A3G activity) than virus used from untreated THP-1 cells. This suggests that S. cristatus CC5A contains a molecule that induces A3G/F expression and thereby inhibits HIV replication. These findings might lead to the discovery of a novel anti-HIV/AIDS therapeutic.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  - The distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. ZmpB was ubiquitous in the Mitis and Salivarius groups of the genus Streptococcus and in the genera Gemella and Granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. IgA1 protease activity was observed in all members of S. pneumoniae, S. pseudopneumoniae, S. oralis, S. sanguinis, and Gemella haemolysans, was variably present in S. mitis and S. infantis, and absent in S. gordonii, S. parasanguinis, S. cristatus, S. oligofermentans, S. australis, S. peroris, and S. suis. Phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpB, and zmpD genes in S. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. Presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. The widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpB, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. IMPORTANCE: The paralogous zinc metalloproteases IgA1 protease, ZmpB, ZmpC, and ZmpD have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study maps the presence of the corresponding genes and enzyme activities in S. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera Streptococcus, Gemella, and Granulicatella. The distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpB is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. The ZmpB protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the Mitis and Salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in Streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. The relative sequence diversification of the IgA1 protease, ZmpB, and ZmpD is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen S. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.
TI  - UV-C-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  - AIM: Previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. LED curing lights (315-400 nm) and other UV lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. We examined the effect of UV-C light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy UV-A light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. METHODS: Twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus australis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis. These organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal UV-C radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before UV-C exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal UV-C exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to UV-C light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. Given that UV-C is more toxic and mutagenic than UV-A light, it is unlikely than UV-A light would yield any difference in response to such exposure.
TI  - Streptococcus troglodytidis sp. nov., isolated from a foot abscess of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes).
AB  - A facultative anaerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, Gram-positive-staining, coccus-shaped bacterium was isolated from an abscess on the right foot of a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The colonies were beta-haemolytic. Catalase and oxidase activities were negative. The Lancefield group B antigen was expressed. On the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics, the bacterium was tentatively identified as a streptococcal species. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacterium shared 96.7 %, 96.4 %, 96.1 %, 95.8 % and 95.7 % sequence similarities with Streptococcus gordonii, S. cristatus, S. intermedius, S. anginosus and S. constellatus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the 16S rRNA gene and housekeeping genes encoding D-alanine : D-alanine ligase (ddl), the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (sodA) revealed that the bacterium represented a novel species closely related to, albeit different from, S. gordonii, S. cristatus and the anginosus streptococci. The name Streptococcus troglodytidis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is M09-11185(T) ( = ATCC BAA-2337(T) = KCTC 33006(T)).
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus ArcA interferes with Porphyromonas gingivalis pathogenicity in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as one of  the major pathogens in chronic periodontitis, an infectious disease affecting the majority of the adult population. We have previously demonstrated that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (ArcA), of Streptococcus cristatus represses production of P. gingivalis long fimbriae and interrupts the formation of P. gingivalis biofilms in vitro. Our in vivo studies have also shown that the distribution of P. gingivalis and S. cristatus in human subgingival plaque is negatively correlated. The objective of this study was to determine if S. cristatus ArcA inhibits P. gingivalis colonization and attenuates its subsequent pathogenesis in alveolar bone loss in the murine oral cavity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A wild-type strain of S. cristatus (CC5A) and its arcA knockout mutant (ArcAE) were used as initial colonizers in the oral cavity of BALB/cByJ mice. Colonization of P. gingivalis on the existing S. cristatus biofilms was assessed by quantitative PCR, and P. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was measured 6 wk after P. gingivalis infection. RESULTS: The presence of S. cristatus CC5A, but not its arcA mutant, attenuated P. gingivalis colonization in the murine oral cavity. In addition, P. gingivalis-induced alveolar bone loss was significantly lower in mice initially infected with S. cristatus CC5A than in those infected with the arcA mutant. CONCLUSION: This study provides direct evidence that S. cristatus ArcA has an inhibitory effect on P. gingivalis colonization, which may in turn attenuate the pathogenicity of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Structure of type 3Gn coaggregation receptor polysaccharide from Streptococcus cristatus LS4.
AB  - The presence of a novel coaggregation receptor polysaccharide (RPS) on the dental plaque isolate Streptococcus cristatus LS4 was suggested by this strain's antigenic and coaggregation properties. Examination of RPS isolated from strain LS4 by a combination of 2-dimensional and pseudo 3-dimensional single quantum heteronuclear NMR methods that included detection of (13)C chemical shifts at high resolution revealed the following repeat unit structure: -->6)-beta-d-Galf-(1-->6)-beta-d-GalpNAc-(1-->3)-alpha-d-Galp-(1-->P-->6)-alpha-d -Galp-(1-->3)-beta-L-Rhap-(1-->4)-beta-d-Glcp-(1-->. The identification of this polysaccharide as RPS3Gn, a new structural type, was established by the alpha-d-Galp-containing epitope of RPS serotype 3 and Gn recognition motif (i.e., beta-d-GalpNAc (1-->3)-alpha-d-Galp) for coaggregation with other bacteria.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus modulates the Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced epithelial  interleukin-8 response through the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We previously reported that the interleukin-8 (IL-8) response to Fusobacterum nucleatum was attenuated in the presence of Streptococcus cristatus. Here, we further examined the underlying mechanism(s) involved in the modulating effect of S. cristatus by looking specifically at its impact on the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway under the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling background. MATERIAL AND METHODS: OKF6/TERT-2 and KB cells were co-cultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination. Secretion of IL-8 protein was measured by ELISA. The nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was evaluated by confocal microscopy, while DNA-binding activity was quantified using TransAM ELISA kits. Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether the anti-inflammatory effect of S. cristatus is related to the modulation of the NF-kappaB inhibitory protein IkappaB-alpha. RESULTS: Incubation with F. nucleatum significantly enhanced the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Exposure to S. cristatus alone did not cause detectable NF-kappaB translocation and was able to inhibit the F. nucleatum-induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation. The TransAM assay further confirmed that S. cristatus blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB in response to F. nucleatum stimulation. In contrast to the nearly complete degradation of IkappaB-alpha induced by F. nucleatum alone, the presence of S. cristatus stabilized IkappaB-alpha. Pre-incubation with TLR2 and TLR4 antibodies, however, did not affect the epithelial response to either species alone or in combination. CONCLUSION: The mechanism by which S. cristatus attenuates F. nucleatum-induced proinflammatory responses in oral epithelial cells appears to involve blockade of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation at the level of IkappaB-alpha degradation.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced cytokine expression by influencing pathways converging on nuclear factor-kappaB.
AB  - We previously reported that Streptococcus cristatus, an oral commensal, was able  to downregulate the interleukin-8 (IL-8) response to Fusobacterium nucleatum, a putative oral pathogen in oral epithelial cells. The aim of this study was to extend the understanding of how S. cristatus regulates cytokine expression in oral epithelial cells on a broad basis, and investigate whether the modulation of a Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway was involved in this process. KB and TERT-2 cells were co-cultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination. Total RNA was extracted and pathway-specific focused microarrays were used to profile the transcriptional responses of various cytokine genes and those related to TLR-mediated signal transduction. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) and protein assays were performed to confirm the microarray results for selected genes. We found that exposure to either S. cristatus or F. nucleatum alone led to distinct changes in cytokine expression patterns. Fusobacterium nucleatum induced a greater number of gene expression changes than S. cristatus (15% vs. 4%, respectively). The presence of S. cristatus with F. nucleatum attenuated the expression of a number of inflammatory cytokines, and upregulated several anti-inflammatory mediators. The RT-PCR confirmed the messenger RNA attenuation of IL-1alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 by S. cristatus. Profiling of TLR-signaling-related genes revealed that S. cristatus most significantly impacted the downstream pathways, especially nuclear factor-kappaB, rather than altering TLRs and their adaptors and interacting proteins. Our data suggest that S. cristatus may attenuate the epithelial proinflammatory cytokine response to F. nucleatum by influencing pathways converging on nuclear factor-kappaB.
TI  - Cultivable anaerobic microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  - Severe early childhood caries (ECC), while strongly associated with Streptococcus mutans using selective detection (culture, PCR), has also been associated with a widely diverse microbiota using molecular cloning approaches. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota of severe ECC using anaerobic culture. The microbial composition of dental plaque from 42 severe ECC children was compared with that of 40 caries-free children. Bacterial samples were cultured anaerobically on blood and acid (pH 5) agars. Isolates were purified, and partial sequences for the 16S rRNA gene were obtained from 5,608 isolates. Sequence-based analysis of the 16S rRNA isolate libraries from blood and acid agars of severe ECC and caries-free children had >90% population coverage, with greater diversity occurring in the blood isolate library. Isolate sequences were compared with taxon sequences in the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD), and 198 HOMD taxa were identified, including 45 previously uncultivated taxa, 29 extended HOMD taxa, and 45 potential novel groups. The major species associated with severe ECC included Streptococcus mutans, Scardovia wiggsiae, Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus cristatus, and Actinomyces gerensceriae. S. wiggsiae was significantly associated with severe ECC children in the presence and absence of S. mutans detection. We conclude that anaerobic culture detected as wide a diversity of species in ECC as that observed using cloning approaches. Culture coupled with 16S rRNA identification identified over 74 isolates for human oral taxa without previously cultivated representatives. The major caries-associated species were S. mutans and S. wiggsiae, the latter of which is a candidate as a newly recognized caries pathogen.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  - The oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. The oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. Glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. The 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by VITEK system using gram-positive identification cards. Species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for PCR identification of isolates. Sequencing of 16S rRNA was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. VITEK system identified a number of 11 strains as S. mitis/oralis, 12 strains as S. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as S. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3 strains as S. salivarius, 3 strains as S. plurianimalium, 1 strain as S. cristatus and 1 strain as S. alactolyticus, respectively. The PCR system targeting gtf genes was able to identify S. oralis, S. salivarius and S. gordonii strains. Sequence of 16S rRNA discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. Their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.
TI  - Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci in viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. However, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways has not yet been examined. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (VGS), in terms of MICs and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs). METHODS: The MICs of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the QRDRs for 190 isolates of VGS, originating from the sputa of adult CF patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. VGS organisms included Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus mutans. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and QRDRs within the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs >/=8 mg/L) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (MICs 4 mg/L). As a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive VGS organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-CF patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. Five novel QRDR PCR assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the CF VGS population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential QRDR resistance mutations. Double mutations in gyrA and parC/parE led to MICs of 16 to >64 mg/L, while single mutations in parC or parE resulted in MICs of 8-32 mg/L and 8 mg/L, respectively. The mean homologies of each species to Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 were: gyrA, 70.3%-95%; gyrB, 69.6%-96.2%; parC, 76.1%-94.8%; and parE, 70.7%-94.7%. The close relatives of S. pneumoniae, S. mitis and S. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of P. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with CF may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal VGS flora, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the Streptococcus milleri group.
TI  - Population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (VGS) including Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - A study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (VGS) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult CF patients were examined by selective conventional culture on Mitis-Salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates of VGS. Sequence analyses of the rpnB and 16-23S rRNA ITS genes identified these isolates to belong to 12 species of VGS and included S. anginosus, S. australis, S. cristatus, S. gordonii, S. infantis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguinis, S. pneumoniae, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis. The most frequently VGS organism isolated was S. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by S. mitis (36/190; 19%), S. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), S. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), S. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), S. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), S. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), S. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), S. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), S. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), S. australis (1/190; 0.5%), S. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and S. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). All, but four, patients harboured at least one VGS species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. There was no clonality at the subspecies level employing ERIC RAPD PCR. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. Overall, resistance to penicillin with all VGS was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. With regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. In addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-CF population comprising 12 individuals (50 VGS isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. In comparison, 8% and 38% of VGS isolates from non-CF individuals were resistant by disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. None of the non-CF VGS organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.
TI  - Clonal analysis of the microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Severe early childhood caries is a microbial infection that severely compromises the dentition of young children. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiota of severe early childhood caries. METHODS: Dental plaque samples from 2- to 6-year-old children were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing, and by specific PCR amplification for Streptococcus mutans and Bifidobacteriaceae species. RESULTS: Children with severe caries (n = 39) had more dental plaque and gingival inflammation than caries-free children (n = 41). Analysis of phylotypes from operational taxonomic unit analysis of 16S rRNA clonal metalibraries from severe caries and caries-free children indicated that while libraries differed significantly (p < 0.0001), there was increased diversity than detected in this clonal analysis. Using the Human Oral Microbiome Database, 139 different taxa were identified. Within the limits of this study, caries-associated taxa included Granulicatella elegans (p < 0.01) and Veillonella sp. HOT-780 (p < 0.01). The species associated with caries-free children included Capnocytophaga gingivalis (p < 0.01), Abiotrophia defectiva (p < 0.01), Lachnospiraceae sp. HOT-100 (p < 0.05), Streptococcus sanguinis (p < 0.05) and Streptococcus cristatus (p < 0.05). By specific PCR, S. mutans (p < 0.005) and Bifidobacteriaceae spp. (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with severe caries. CONCLUSION: Clonal analysis of 80 children identified a diverse microbiota that differed between severe caries and caries-free children, but the association of S. mutans with caries was from specific PCR analysis, not from clonal analysis, of samples.
TI  - Bacterial 16S sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. In addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in pH homeostasis. The bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions. S. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated with caries progression in the overall model. Lactobacillus or S. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. Other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of Selenomonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus mitis. Propionibacterium FMA5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. An overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the Streptococcus mitis-S. pneumoniae-S. infantis group, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium IR009, Campylobacter rectus, and Lachnospiraceae sp. C1. The relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16S rRNA gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
TI  - Role of arginine deiminase of Streptococcus cristatus in Porphyromonas gingivalis colonization.
AB  - The ability to attach to a variety of oral surfaces is an important characteristic of Porphyromonas gingivalis. Previous studies have demonstrated that expression and production of FimA, a major subunit protein of the long fimbriae, is required for P. gingivalis colonization. Here we report that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (ArcA) of Streptococcus cristatus, represses FimA production and inhibits biofilm formation of P. gingivalis. This inhibitory function of ArcA is also observed in the formation of heterotypic P. gingivalis-Streptococcus gordonii biofilms. P. gingivalis is released from streptococcal substrates in the presence of ArcA, likely due to an inhibition of FimA production. This work suggests that ArcA may have the potential to be a specific antibiofilm agent to fight P. gingivalis infections.
TI  - Partial recN gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus Streptococcus.
AB  - Partial sequences of the recN gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. The partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. The mean DNA sequence similarity of recN gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be lower than those of the 16S rRNA gene (94.1 %), rpoB (84.6 %), sodA (74.8 %), groEL (78.1 %) and gyrB (73.2 %). Phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: Streptococcus salivarius, S. equinus, S. hyovaginalis/S. pluranimalium/S. thoraltensis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans and S. suis. The 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: Streptococcus sanguinis/S. cristatus/S. sinensis, S. anginosus/S. intermedius/S. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and S. mitis/S. infantis/S. peroris/S. oralis/S. oligofermentans/S. pneumoniae/S. pseudopneumoniae. The partial recN gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groEL, gyrB, rpoB and sodA). A high percentage of similarity was found between S. intermedius and S. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recN gene. To study the genetic diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recN, groEL, sodA, gyrB and rpoB sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. The results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.
TI  - Negative correlation of distributions of Streptococcus cristatus and Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major causative agents of adult periodontitis. One of the features of this periodontal pathogen is its ability to attach to a variety of oral bacterial surfaces and to colonize subgingival dental plaque. We have shown that Streptococcus cristatus CC5A inhibits expression of fimA, a gene encoding the major protein subunit of long fimbriae in P. gingivalis; as a result, S. cristatus interrupts formation of P. gingivalis biofilms. Here we further demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of S. cristatus affects multiple strains of P. gingivalis and that optimal inhibitory activity correlates with levels of arginine deiminase expression in S. cristatus. More strikingly, the impact of S. cristatus on P. gingivalis colonization was revealed by comparing levels of P. gingivalis and S. cristatus in subgingival dental plaque. Spearman correlation analysis indicated a negative correlation between the distributions of S. cristatus and P. gingivalis (r = -0.57; P < 0.05). These data suggest that some early colonizers of dental plaque, such as S. cristatus, may be beneficial to the host by antagonizing the colonization and accumulation of periodontal pathogens such as P. gingivalis.
TI  - Interference with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: colonization of epithelial cells under hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial interactions are considered to be important for bacterial colonization. Interactions that inhibit colonization of pathogens could possibly be used as a new treatment approach for periodontitis. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis on soft surfaces in vitro, taking into account the hydrodynamic forces continuously present in vivo. METHODS: Cultured epithelial cells were precolonized with Streptococcus sanguinis KTH-4, Streptococcus cristatus CC5A, Streptococcus salivarius TOVE and Streptococcus mitis BMS before Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans colonization. Experiments were performed in a modified Robbins-device-type flow cell. Bacterial colonization and the number of epithelial cells were evaluated by microbial culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The streptococci were able to inhibit A. actinomycetemcomitans colonization on soft tissue surfaces under flow conditions. Statistically significant differences were found between streptococcal pretreatments and the controls, with the most pronounced effect caused by S. sanguinis. CONCLUSION: These data confirm the possibility of applying beneficial bacteria in periodontal treatment.
TI  - Molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(B) and mef(A)] in Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (VGS) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within CF airways has not yet been examined. We therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. METHODS: Erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (VGS) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and VGS [n = 84; i.e. Streptococcus salivarius (n = 30), Streptococcus mitis (n = 17), Streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), Streptococcus oralis (n = 10), Streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), Streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), Streptococcus infantis (n = 3), Streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), Streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and Streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult CF patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for at least the previous 7 months. RESULTS: Almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. The majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(B) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(A) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(E) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(B) and mef(E) genes simultaneously in 11/99 (11.1%). These results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in VGS in adult CF patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment with azithromycin in CF patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal VGS, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans adhesion inhibited in a flow cell.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial interactions are considered important in the adhesion process of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. This study addressed the hypothesis that a streptococcal biofilm influences the hard tissue colonization by the periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans under hydrodynamic conditions. METHODS: The colonization of a green-fluorescent-protein-labelled A. actinomycetemcomitans strain on surfaces coated with a streptococcal biofilm, was monitored in real time using a confocal laser scanning microscope-mounted flow cell. Culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction data were obtained in parallel from a Modified Robbins Device. RESULTS: Colonization of A. actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited by the four tested streptococci (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus mitis). The most inhibiting species was S. sanguinis. CONCLUSION: These results confirmed the hypothesis that some bacterial species influence A. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of hard surfaces in vitro under hydrodynamic conditions.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. Various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. Evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, Streptococcus cristatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: KB, TERT-2, TR146 and SCC15 cells were cocultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination, at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 under various conditions. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: F. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas S. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. When present together, S. cristatus attenuated the F. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of S. cristatus was independent of its viability and its co-aggregation with F. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. Similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that S. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to F. nucleatum challenge.
TI  - Role of differential expression of streptococcal arginine deiminase in inhibition of fimA expression in Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - Streptococcus cristatus ArcA inhibits production of a major adhesin, FimA, in Porphyromonas gingivalis, a primary periodontal pathogen. In this study, we demonstrate the differential expression of arcA in two streptococcal species. The expression level of arcA in streptococci appears to be controlled by both cis and trans elements.
TI  - Bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  - Culture-based studies have shown that Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (RC). The purpose of the present study was to assess the bacterial diversity of RC in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. Plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no RC and from 11 subjects with RC. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes from extracted DNA were PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. From a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. The majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. Species of Selenomonas and Veillonella were common in all samples. The healthy microbiota included Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, Leptotrichia spp., Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus cristatus, and Kingella oralis. Lactobacilli were absent, S. mutans was present in one, and Actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. In contrast, the microbiota of the RC subjects was dominated by Actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, S. mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, Selenomonas sp. clone CS002, Atopobium and Olsenella spp., Prevotella multisaccharivorax, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and Propionibacterium sp. strain FMA5. The bacterial profiles of RC showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. The data suggest that putative etiological agents of RC include not only S. mutans, lactobacilli, and Actinomyces but also species of Atopobium, Olsenella, Pseudoramibacter, Propionibacterium, and Selenomonas.
TI  - Heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  - Oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. Dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. An additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. Using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. An integrative computational predictive model determined microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. Heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. The levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in caries-active individuals, including, A. defectiva, S. parasanguinis, S. mitis/oralis, S. sanguinis, S. cristatus, S. salivarius, Streptococcus sp. clone CH016, G. morbillorum and G. haemolysans. Moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). Similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. It appears that genetic and/or familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial species in twins.
TI  - Identification of a signalling molecule involved in bacterial intergeneric communication.
AB  - The development of complex multispecies communities such as biofilms is controlled by interbacterial communication systems. We have previously reported an intergeneric communication between two oral bacteria, Streptococcus cristatus and Porphyromonas gingivalis, that results in inhibition of fimA expression. Here, we demonstrate that a surface protein, arginine deiminase (ArcA), of S. cristatus serves as a signal that initiates intergeneric communication. An ArcA-deficient mutant of S. cristatus is unable to communicate with P. gingivalis. Furthermore, arginase activity is not essential for the communication, and ArcA retains the ability to repress expression of fimA in the presence of arginine deiminase inhibitors. These results present a novel mechanism by which intergeneric communication in dental biofilms is accomplished.
TI  - Demonstration of in vivo transfer of doxycycline resistance mediated by a novel transposon.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the transfer of bacterial doxycycline resistance between oral bacteria in subjects receiving systemic doxycycline for the treatment of periodontitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Streptococci were cultured before and after treatment from the subgingival plaque of two patients with periodontitis, genotyped and investigated for the presence of antimicrobial resistance determinants and conjugative transposons. RESULTS: In one subject, a strain of Streptococcus sanguinis resistant to doxycycline was a minor component of the pre-treatment streptococcal flora but dominated post-treatment. In a second subject, a strain of Streptococcus cristatus, which was sensitive to doxycycline before treatment, was found to have acquired a novel conjugative transposon during treatment, rendering it resistant to doxycycline and erythromycin. The novel transposon, named CTn6002, was sequenced and found to be a complex element derived in part from Tn916, and an unknown element which included the erythromycin resistance gene erm(B). A strain of Streptococcus oralis isolated from this subject pre-treatment was found to harbour CTn6002 and was therefore implicated as the donor. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first direct demonstration of transfer of antimicrobial resistance carried on a conjugative transposon between oral bacteria during systemic antimicrobial treatment of periodontitis in humans.
TI  - Association of a high-molecular weight arginine-binding protein of Fusobacterium  nucleatum ATCC 10953 with adhesion to secretory immunoglobulin A and coaggregation with Streptococcus cristatus.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregates with a diverse range of bacterial species, and binds to host tissues and proteins such as immunoglobulin. These interactions may support the attachment of a variety of organisms to oral surfaces and can facilitate the invasion of soft tissues. We hypothesized that coaggregation with streptococci and immunoglobulin binding may occur by a common adhesin sensitive to l-arginine. METHODS: Repeated mixing of F. nucleatum with non-immune secretory immunoglobulin A (S-IgA) and recovery of non-agglutinating cells isolated a spontaneous mutant (isolate 21) of F. nucleatum that was defective in S-IgA binding. Wild-type and mutant F. nucleatum were compared by coaggregation and adhesion assays. RESULTS: Isolate 21 exhibited significantly reduced S-IgA binding and coaggregation with oral streptococci but not with Porphyromonas gingivalis. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the mutant was deficient compared to wild-type for a single protein of approximately 360 kilodaltons. The corresponding protein was isolated from wild-type F. nucleatum protein preparations by coprecipitation with arginine-agarose beads. This protein was able to bind both Streptococcus cristatus and S-IgA. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that this protein was closely related to putative autotransporter proteins in other F. nucleatum strains and was a 100% match to the deduced amino acid sequence of a 10,638-base-pair open reading frame in the incomplete genome sequence of F. nucleatum ATCC 10,953. Peptides identified by MS-MS analysis spanned most of the predicted amino acid sequence, suggesting that the mature protein is not subject to postsecretory cleavage. CONCLUSION: Coaggregation represents a novel function within the autotransporter class of proteins, which are often associated with virulence.
TI  - Salmonellae reduction in poultry by competitive exclusion bacteria Lactobacillus  salivarius and Streptococcus cristatus.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a defined competitive exclusion bacteria (CE) culture that will prevent or substantially reduce Salmonella colonization of poultry. The efficacy of 56 potential CE isolates in preventing or reducing Salmonella colonization in chickens was determined. These potential CE were perorally administered to day-of-hatch chicks at 10(6) to 10(8) CFU per chick, and salmonellae were subsequently administered by gavage 2 days later at 5.5 x 10(3) to 5.0 x 10(4) CFU per chick. Feeding chickens an overnight CE culture of Lactobacillus salivarius strains Salm-9, List40-1,8, or List40-41 reduced Salmonella carriage in cecal contents by 2.10, 2.52, and 2.20 log CFU/g (average of three trials), respectively. The percentages of Salmonella-positive chickens after receiving these treatments were 35, 31, and 35% respectively, compared with 84% for the untreated control. A mixture of these three isolates had a similar effect when compared with the results of the individual isolates. A mixture of Streptococcus cristatus List40-13 and L. salivarius List40-41 reduced Salmonella carriage from 90 to 65% and 88 to 31% in two feeding trials, and by 2.2 and 4 log CFU/g of cecal contents of chickens. In conclusion, CE isolates L. salivarius Salm-9, List40-18, and List40-41 and S. cristatus List40-13 either individually or in combination were effective in significantly preventing Salmonella colonization of chickens.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus isolated from a resected heart valve and blood cultures:  case reports and application of phenotypic and genotypic techniques for identification.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viridans streptococci are known as an important cause of endocarditis, but at present no cases of endocarditis caused by Streptococcus cristatus have been published, probably because phenotypic identification of viridans streptococci is tedious. Using tDNA-PCR, it is possible to identify to species level and to differentiate between species of the viridans group.
TI  - Relationship between the ability of oral streptococci to interact with platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha and with the salivary low-molecular-weight mucin, MG2.
AB  - The oral streptococci Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis are common aetiological agents of infective endocarditis, and their ability to adhere to and induce the aggregation of platelets is thought to be a virulence trait. The platelet glycoprotein GPIbalpha has been implicated as the adhesion receptor for S. sanguinis and S. gordonii, but it is not known if this is the case for S. oralis and other species. The aim of this study was to determine the GPIbalpha-interactive capability of a range of oral streptococci and to determine the relationship between this capability and their ability to interact with the salivary constituents that they would encounter in their normal habitat. All platelet-adhesive S. sanguinis strains and most S. gordonii strains adhered in a GPIbalpha-dependent manner, but strains of S. oralis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus parasanguinis and Streptococcus mitis had no direct affinity for platelets. Those strains that were able to bind GPIbalpha also bound to the low-molecular-weight submandibular salivary mucin, MG2, and this interaction was sialic acid-dependent. The data suggest that S. sanguinis and S. gordonii may be efficient colonizers of platelet vegetations because of their adaptation to recognize sialylated salivary mucins. In contrast, S. oralis does not interact with platelets and so is likely to colonize vegetations through an as yet unidentified mechanism.
TI  - Expression of the short fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  - The Mfa1 protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii. We utilized a promoter-lacZ reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. Promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus cristatus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. Expression of SspA/B, the streptococcal receptor for Mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. Proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of Mfa1 expression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.
TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum transports noninvasive Streptococcus cristatus into human epithelial cells.
AB  - Analysis of human buccal epithelial cells frequently reveals an intracellular polymicrobial consortium of bacteria. Although several oral bacteria have been demonstrated to invade cultured epithelial cells, several others appear unable to internalize. We hypothesized that normally noninvasive bacteria may gain entry into epithelial cells via adhesion to invasive bacteria. Fusobacterium nucleatum is capable of binding to and invading oral epithelial cells. By contrast, Streptococcus cristatus binds weakly to host cells and is not internalized. F. nucleatum and S. cristatus coaggregate strongly via an arginine-sensitive interaction. Coincubation of KB or TERT-2 epithelial cells with equal numbers of F. nucleatum and S. cristatus bacteria led to significantly increased numbers of adherent and internalized streptococci. F. nucleatum also promoted invasion of KB cells by other oral streptococci and Actinomyces naeslundii. Dissection of fusobacterial or streptococcal adhesive interactions by using sugars, amino acids, or antibodies demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to direct attachment of S. cristatus to adherent and invading F. nucleatum. Inhibition of F. nucleatum host cell attachment and invasion with galactose, or fusobacterial-streptococcal coaggregation by the arginine homologue l-canavanine, abrogated the increased S. cristatus adhesion to, and invasion of, host cells. In addition, polyclonal antibodies to F. nucleatum, which inhibited fusobacterial attachment to both KB cells and S. cristatus, significantly decreased invasion by both species. Similar decreases were obtained when epithelial cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D, staurosporine, or cycloheximide. These studies indicate that F. nucleatum may facilitate the colonization of epithelial cells by bacteria unable to adhere or invade directly.
TI  - Association of a novel high molecular weight, serine-rich protein (SrpA) with fibril-mediated adhesion of the oral biofilm bacterium Streptococcus cristatus.
AB  - The surface of the oral plaque bacterium Streptococcus cristatus is decorated with a lateral tuft of fibrils. The fibrillar tuft functions in the adhesion of S. cristatus to heterologous bacterial species in the plaque biofilm. The tuft typically consists of a densely packed fringe of shorter fibrils 238 +/- 19 nm long with longer, less abundant fibrils 403 +/- 66 nm long projecting through the fringe of short fibrils. The two types of fibrils in the tufts of S. cristatus have been refractory to biochemical separation, complicating their characterization. A hexadecane partition assay was used to enrich for subpopulations of S. cristatus CR311 (type strain NCTC 12479) having distinct fibrillar morphotypes. Negative staining in the TEM revealed that cells of a hydrophobic subpopulation of S. cristatus (CR311var1) carried only the long fibrils (395 +/- 32 nm). A hydrophilic subpopulation of S. cristatus (CR311var3) consisted of mixed morphotypes having no fibrils or remnant short fibrils (223 +/- 49 nm). No long fibrils were observed on any cells in the CR311var3 subpopulation. The CR311var3 morphotype, unlike the wild-type strain and CR311var1, was not able to form corncobs with either Corynebacterium matruchotii or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Variant CR311var3 did not express the novel gene srpA, which encodes a high molecular weight (321,882 Da) serine-rich protein, SrpA. The SrpA protein contains two extensive repeat motifs of 17 and 71 amino acids and a gram-positive cell wall anchor consensus sequence (LPNTG). The unusual properties of SrpA most closely resemble those of Fap1, the fimbrial-associated adhesin protein of Streptococcus parasanguis. The association of long fibrils, high surface hydrophobicity, ability to form corncob formations, and expression of the srpA gene suggest that SrpA is a long fibril protein in S. cristatus.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis genes involved in fimA regulation.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is an important component of the complex plaque biofilm  that is a direct precursor of periodontal disease. The major fimbriae are required for attachment to oral surfaces and are an important virulence factor. Fimbrillin (FimA) expression in P. gingivalis is inhibited by surface molecule of Streptococcus cristatus, an early colonizer of dental plaque. In this study, differential display PCR was used to identify P. gingivalis genes that are regulated in response to S. cristatus. Of several differentially expressed genes, pg2131 and pg2167 were upregulated by S. cristatus signaling molecules. A null mutant of pg2167 did not transcriptionally regulate fimA following exposure to S. cristatus. In fact, fimA transcription was enhanced in the pg2167 mutant, suggesting that pg2167 may act to repress fimA expression. In contrast, a mutation in pg2131 did not affect transcription of fimA in the presence of S. cristatus. However, production of fimbrillin was significantly diminished in the pg2131 mutant, implicating involvement in posttranscriptional regulation in fimbriation. These data suggest that P. gingivalis fimbriation is controlled by more than one regulation mechanism, involving both transcriptional and posttranscriptional processes.
TI  - Mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  - The production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of RNase B and subsequent utilization of released mannose. RNase B is an excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. Mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus infantis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. None of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or Streptococcus peroris and Streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the Man(5) glycan alone was degraded while Man(6) to Man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in Man(5), remained intact. Investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone- or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation of the Man(5) glycan of RNase B. No species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the Streptococcus anginosus, S. gordonii, and S. intermedius species. The data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.
TI  - Intergeneric communication in dental plaque biofilms.
AB  - Dental plaque is a complex biofilm that accretes in a series of discrete steps proceeding from a gram-positive streptococcus-rich biofilm to a structure rich in gram-negative anaerobes. This study investigated information flow between two unrelated plaque bacteria, Streptococcus cristatus and Porphyromonas gingivalis. A surface protein of S. cristatus caused repression of the P. gingivalis fimbrial gene (fimA), as determined by a chromosomal fimA promoter-lacZ reporter construct and by reverse transcription-PCR. Signaling activity was associated with a 59-kDa surface protein of S. cristatus and showed specificity for the fimA gene. Furthermore, P. gingivalis was unable to form biofilm microcolonies with S. cristatus. Thus, S. cristatus is capable of modulating virulence gene expression in P. gingivalis, consequently influencing the development of pathogenic plaque.
TI  - Identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  - The utility of PCR analysis of transfer DNA intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tDNA-ILP) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15 species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rRNA homology groups. PCR products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tDNA primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and by laser fluorescence scanning. Eleven species showed specific and distinct tDNA patterns: Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus parasanguinis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus criceti and Streptococcus ratti. Indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: Streptococcus vestibularis and Streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermedius on the other. S. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing S. mitis biovar 1 and two S. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with S. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. These results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that S. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. In conclusion, PCR analysis of tDNA-ILP holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.
