TI  == bacteria isolated from dugongs (dugong dugon) submitted for postmortem examination in queensland, australia, 2000-2011.
AB  == microbial infection may contribute to disease in a significant proportion of marine mammal mortalities, but little is known about infectious bacterial species and their prevalence in dugongs (dugong dugon). this study represents a survey of the species of bacteria and fungi isolated from dugongs submitted to the university of queensland's school of veterinary science for postmortem examination. thirty-six dugongs were included in the survey, with 23 species of bacteria and four species of fungus cultured from lesions that were suspected of  contributing to local infection, systemic infection, or both. the most abundant bacteria included aeromonas spp., clostridium spp., vibrio spp., enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas spp. in six cases, the microorganism(s) cultured were considered to have been associated with disease. mixed infections containing aeromonas spp. and vibrio spp.; morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida, and serratia marcescens; and actinomyces spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were associated with pneumonia or pleuritis, and enterococcus faecalis was associated  with a multisystemic infection in a neonate. clostridium spp. was cultured from two animals with peritonitis and likely septicemia. the significance of many of the other isolates is uncertain because the samples were taken after death, and some of the species isolated may represent postmortem overgrowth. it is also difficult to fulfil koch's postulates through experimental infection in marine mammals. regardless, this information will assist clinicians working with dugongs to make treatment decisions and the baseline data on the prevalence of bacterial  and fungal species is of value for monitoring coastal water habitat health and risks of zoonotic disease transmission.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of wild mushroom extracts against clinical isolates resistant to different antibiotics.
AB  == aims: this work aimed to screen the antimicrobial activity of aqueous methanolic  extracts of 13 mushroom species, collected in braganca, against several clinical  isolates obtained in hospital center of tras-os-montes and alto douro, portugal.  methods and results: microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc).  mic results showed that russula delica and fistulina hepatica extracts inhibited  the growth of gram-negative (escherichia coli, morganella morganni and pasteurella multocida) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. a bactericide effect of both extracts was observed in past. multocida, strep. agalactiae and strep. pyogenes with mbc of 20, 10 and 5 mg ml(-)(1), respectively. lepista nuda extract exhibited a bactericide effect upon past. multocida at 5 mg ml(-)(1) and inhibited proteus mirabilis at 20 mg ml(-)(1). ramaria botrytis extract showed activity against enterococcus faecalis and l. monocytogenes, being bactericide for past. multocida, strep. agalactiae (mbcs 20 mg ml(-)(1)) and strep. pyogenes (mbc 10 mg ml(-)(1)). leucopaxillus giganteus extract inhibited the growth of e. coli and pr. mirabilis, being bactericide for past. multocida, strep. pyogenes and strep.  agalactiae. conclusions: fistulina hepatica, r. botrytis and r. delica are the most promising species as antimicrobial agents. significance and impact of the study: mushroom extracts could be an alternative as antimicrobials against pathogenic micro-organisms resistant to conventional treatments.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of poland.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of poland in years 2003-2005. bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from california mastitis test (cmt) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of api tests (analytical profile index). it was found that 32.7% of samples that were cmt positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) (14.6%), staph. aureus (8.6%), gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among gram-negative bacilli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), serratia marcescens (3.1%), pasteurella multocida (3.1%), acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria  species. stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), staph. hyicus (12.2%), staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), staph. sciuri (11.6%), staph. chromogenes (8.8%), staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent cns. streptococcus uberis (50%), str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), str. acidominimus (6.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among camp-negative streptococci. an increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, staph. aureus, a. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.

TI  == gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  == in most organisms, glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and gsh synthetase (gs). in streptococcus agalactiae, gsh synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-gcs-gs). the n-terminal sequence of gamma-gcs-gs is similar to escherichia coli gamma-gcs, but the c-terminal sequence is an atp-grasp domain more similar to d-ala, d-ala ligase than to any known gs. in the present studies, c-terminally and n-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-gcs and gs domains, respectively. although wt gamma-gcs-gs is nearly uninhibited by gsh (k(i) approximately 140 mm), shorter gamma-gcs domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (k(i) approximately 15 mm), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-gcs enzymes. because studies with e. coli gamma-gcs implicate a flexible loop region in gsh binding, chimeras of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs were made containing gamma-gcs domain flexible loop sequences from enterococcus faecalis and pasteurella multocida gamma-gcs-gs, isoforms that are inhibited by gsh. inhibition remained s. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). c-terminal constructs of gamma-gcs-gs have gs activity (0.01-0.04% of wt), but proper folding and significant gs activity required a covalently linked gamma-gcs domain. in addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-gcs-gs sequence established that gs activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-gcs domain. our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-gcs-gs and suggest gamma-gcs-gs evolved from a monomeric gamma-gcs that became c-terminally fused to a multimeric atp-grasp protein.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot  for anaerobes. ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/l with only 4/5 campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 campylobacter rectus strains  requiring . or = 16 mg/l for inhibition. ertapenem was only moderately active (mic 8 mg/l) against 4/6 enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 staphylococcus epidermidis strains. all pasteurella multocida, pasteurella septica, pasteurella  canis, pasteurella dagmatis, moraxella spp. and ef-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/l. mic(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/l; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/l; staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/l; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/l; streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/l; eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/l; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/l. for anaerobes the range of mics and mic(90)s were: prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/l; porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/l; fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/l; bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/l; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/l. ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay v 3522, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of bay v 3522 was compared with the activities of cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. mics (in micrograms/ml) of bay v 3522 were as follows: staphylococcus spp. (except for oxacillin-resistant strains), 0.13 to 1; streptococcus spp. (except for some viridans group streptococci), less than or equal to 0.015 to 0.25; enterococcus faecalis, 2 to 8; other enterococci, 0.5 to greater than 32; beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis, 0.13  to 1; beta-lactamase-positive h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis, 0.5 to 4; pasteurella multocida, 0.06 to 0.25; and members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 0.5 to greater than 32. among the cephalosporins, bay v 3522  was the most active against gram-positive cocci and cefixime was the most active  against gram-negative bacilli; bay v 3522 was similar in activity to amoxicillin-clavulanate against most species.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
