TI  == antimicrobial activities of various fractions of longan (dimocarpus longan lour.  fen ke) seed extract.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of longan (dimocarpus longan lour. fen ke) seed extracts were investigated using a disc diffusion method and also determining the minimal inhibitory concentration. the dl-p01-si01 fraction showed that the strongest activity against staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus at mic 64 mug/ml, which was found to be due to the phenolic compounds. the hplc analysis showed that the major phenolic compounds are gallic acid, corilagin, ethyl gallate and ellagic acid.

TI  == synthesis, optimization, and characterization of silver nanoparticles from acinetobacter calcoaceticus and their enhanced antibacterial activity when combined with antibiotics.
AB  == background: the development of nontoxic methods of synthesizing nanoparticles is  a major step in nanotechnology to allow their application in nanomedicine. the present study aims to biosynthesize silver nanoparticles (agnps) using a cell-free extract of acinetobacter spp. and evaluate their antibacterial activity. methods: eighteen strains of acinetobacter were screened for agnp synthesis. agnps were characterized using various techniques. reaction parameters were optimized, and their effect on the morphology of agnps was studied. the synergistic potential of agnps on 14 antibiotics against seven pathogens was determined by disc-diffusion, broth-microdilution, and minimum bactericidal concentration assays. the efficacy of agnps was evaluated as per the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: only a. calcoaceticus lrvp54 produced agnps within 24 hours. monodisperse spherical nanoparticles of 8-12 nm were obtained with 0.7 mm silver nitrate at 70 degrees c. during optimization, a  blue-shift in ultraviolet-visible spectra was seen. x-ray diffraction data and lattice fringes (d =0.23 nm) observed under high-resolution transmission electron microscope confirmed the crystallinity of agnps. these agnps were found to be more effective against gram-negative compared with gram-positive microorganisms.  overall, agnps showed the highest synergy with vancomycin in the disc-diffusion assay. for enterobacter aerogenes, a 3.8-fold increase in inhibition zone area was observed after the addition of agnps with vancomycin. reduction in mic and minimum bactericidal concentration was observed on exposure of agnps with antibiotics. interestingly, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was highly sensitized in the presence of agnps and became susceptible to antibiotics except  cephalosporins. similarly, the vancomycin-resistant strain of streptococcus mutans was also found to be susceptible to antibiotic treatment when agnps were added. these biogenic agnps showed significant synergistic activity on the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. conclusion: this is the first report of synthesis of agnps using a. calcoaceticus lrvp54 and their significant synergistic activity with antibiotics resulting in increased susceptibility of multidrug-resistant bacteria evaluated as per mic breakpoints of the clsi standard.

TI  == radical scavenging activity of the essential oil of silver fir (abies alba).
AB  == the essential oil of silver fir (abies alba) is known to help respiratory system  and have easing and soothing effect for muscle. in the present study, we investigated the chemical composition, cytotoxicity and its biological activities of silver fir (abies alba) essential oil. the composition of the oil was analyzed by gc-ms and bornyl acetate (30.31%), camphene (19.81%), 3-carene (13.85%), tricyclene (12.90%), dl-limonene (7.50%), alpha-pinene (2.87%), caryophyllene (2.18%), beta-phellandrene (2.13%), borneol (1.74%), bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene,2,3-dimethyl (1.64%) and alpha-terpinene (1.24%) were the major components in the oil. the results tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay indicated that the oil showed no cytotoxic effect, at concentrations of 1 and 5%, for as long as 24 and 3 h, respectively. the antiradical capacity was evaluated by measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oil on the 2,20-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (dpph) and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (abts) radicals. the oil was able to reduce the both radicals dose-dependently, and the concentration required for 50% reduction  (rc(50)) against dpph radicals (2.7 +/- 0.63%) was lower than abts radicals (8.5  +/- 0.27%). the antibacterial activity of the oil was also evaluated using disc diffusion method against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, listeria monocytogenes, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and vibrio parahaemolyticcus. the oil exhibited no antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains tested except s. aureus of mild activity.
