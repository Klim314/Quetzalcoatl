TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == examination of the technological properties of newly isolated strains of the genus and possibilities for their application in the composition of starters.
AB  == the ability of four lactobacillus strains - lactobacillus brevis lbrz7 (isolated  from fermented cabbage), lactobacillus plantarum lbrz12 (isolated from fermented  cabbage), lactobacillus fermentum lbrh9 (of human origin) and lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus lbrc11 (isolated from home-made cheese) - to grow in flour/water environment and to accumulate high concentrations of viable cells was examined. two starters for sourdough were created for lab-scale production of wheat bread:  a two-strain starter and a four-strain starter. wheat bread with improved properties - greater loaf volume, enhanced flavour and softer and brighter crumb  - was obtained from the 7% four-strain starter sourdough. the addition of sourdough in the production of wheat bread affected positively the technological  and organoleptic characteristics of the final bread by inhibiting the growth of wild yeasts and mold and bacillus spores without the addition of preservatives. the inclusion of 15% of the four-strain starter sourdough in the bread-making process led to enhanced safety and longer shelf life of the baked bread.

TI  == amelioration of ovalbumin induced allergic symptoms in balb/c mice by potentially probiotic strains of lactobacilli.
AB  == to evaluate the antiallergic effect of newly characterised probiotic strains, lactobacillus fermentum nws29, lactobacillus casei nwp08 and lactobacillus rhamnosus nwp13, mice were divided into six experimental groups: control, ovalbumin (ova), nws29, nwp08, nwp13 and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg). mice were immunised and probiotics were administered via oral gavage followed by challenge  with ova. after last challenge with ova, inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf), recruitment of inflammatory cells in airways and ova-specific immunoglobulin e (ige) in serum were determined by giemsa, haematoxylin and eosin (he) staining, and elisa, respectively. relative mrna expression of interleukins (il-4, il-5, il-10, il-13 and il-17), transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) in lung and spleen tissue was determined by real time rt-pcr. ova-specific ige levels, recruitment of eosinophils and mrna expressions of inflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased in ova-exposed mice compared with the control group. administration of  nws29 and nwp13 suppressed inflammatory cell infiltration in airways and balf, and level of ova-specific ige in serum of ova-exposed mice. furthermore, nws29 and nwp13 also abrogated the mrna expression of 1l-4, il-5, il-13 and tgf-beta in mice immunised and exposed to ova. our findings suggest that nws29 and nwp13 might be good candidates for the prevention of allergic airway inflammation.

TI  == the use of pfge method in genotyping of selected bacteria species of the lactobacillus genus.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus are a group of microorganisms in which there are numerous strains with high probiotic potential. in recent years,  interest in probiotics as nutritional supplements and as drugs has significantly  increased. in order to carry out research on probiotic bacterial strains, their beneficial effects on the human body should be confirmed and molecular typing should be carried out with the aim of marking a specific strain. pulse-field gel  electrophoresis (pfge) is the reference method employed for bacterial genotyping, but it is commonly used for typing mainly pathogenic bacteria. the following study describes a way of performing pfge analysis in genotyping of bacteria species belonging to the genus lactobacillus: l. fermentum, l. gasseri, l. plantarum and l. rhamnosus.

TI  == the influence of the wooden equipment employed for cheese manufacture on the characteristics of a traditional stretched cheese during ripening.
AB  == the influence of the wooden equipment used for the traditional cheese manufacturing from raw milk was evaluated on the variations of chemico-physical characteristics and microbial populations during the ripening of caciocavallo palermitano cheese. milk from two farms (a, extensive; b, intensive) was processed in traditional and standard conditions. chemical and physical traits of cheeses were affected by the farming system and the cheese making technology, and changed during ripening. content in nacl and n soluble was lower, and paste consistency higher in cheese from the extensive farm and traditional technology,  whereas ripening increased the n soluble and the paste yellow and consistency. the ripening time decreased the number of all lactic acid bacteria (lab) groups,  except enterococci detected at approximately constant levels (10(4) and 10(5) cfu g(-1) for standard and traditional cheeses, respectively), till 120 d of ripening. in all productions, at each ripening time, the levels detected for enterococci were lower than those for the other lab groups. the canonical discriminant analysis of chemical, physical and microbiological data was able to  separate cheeses from different productions and ripening time. the dominant lab were isolated, phenotypically characterised and grouped, genetically differentiated at strain level and identified. ten species of lab were found and  the strains detected at the highest levels were pediococcus acidilactici and lactobacillus casei. ten strains, mainly belonging to lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus fermentum showed an antibacterial activity. the comparison of the polymorphic profiles of the lab strains isolated from the wooden vat with those of the strains collected during maturation, showed the persistence of three enterococci in traditional cheeses, with enterococcus faecalis found at dominant  levels over the enterococcus population till 120 d; the absence of these strains  in the standard productions evidenced the contribution of vat lab during caciocavallo palermitano cheese ripening.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == effect of the bread-making process on zearalenone levels.
AB  == the effects of the bread-making process including fermentation with saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus fermentum) and baking at 200 degrees c on zearalenone (zea) levels were investigated. standard solutions of zea were added to flour and then loaves of bread were prepared. sourdough and  three types of yeast including active dry yeast, instant dry yeast and compressed yeast were used for the fermentation of dough. zea levels in flour, dough and bread were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection after extraction and clean-up on an immunoaffinity column. the highest reduction in levels of zea was  found in the first fermentation (first proof), while the lowest reduction was observed in the baking stage. in addition, the results showed that compressed yeast had the maximum reduction potential on zea levels even at the baking stage.

TI  == probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus fermentum strains isolated from tulum  cheese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to characterize the probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus fermentum strains isolated from tulum cheese. seven l. fermentum strains were selected among the isolated and identified lactobacillus strains due to their abundance. when the gastric condition was considered, l. fermentum lp3 and lp4 were able to tolerate ph 2.5 and 1% bile salt. all l. fermentum strains had similar enzymatic activity and antibiotic resistance pattern but the highest  antagonistic effect was detected within lp3, lp4 and lp6. cholesterol assimilation amount of l. fermentum strains ranged between 12.1 and 45.3% in mrs  and 20.7-71.1% in mrs with bile. the highest cholesterol assimilation in mrs and  mrs with bile was occurred by lp3 and lp4, respectively. l. fermentum lp2 adhered to caco-2 cells more than lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg where lp3, lp4 and lp5 adhered at similar level. in conclusion, l. fermentum lp3 and lp4 fulfilled sufficient criteria to be probiotics for use as a starter culture in the production of tulum cheese or other dairy products. also this study indicated that some food-associated lactobacillus strains non-predominant for gut biota have significant probiotic potential.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the probiotic and functional potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from fermented food and human intestine.
AB  == this study aims to evaluate the functional and probiotic characteristics of eight indigenous lactobacillus strains in vitro. the selected lactobacilli include strains of lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. all strains tolerated both ph 2 for 3 h and 1% bile salt for 24 h. the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 were the most adhesive strains producing the highest quantity of eps. although a wide variation in the ability of the eight strains to deplete cholesterol and nitrite, antagonize pathogens, scavenge free radical, and stimulate innate immune response were observed, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 showed the widest range of these useful traits. taken together, the strains cicc 23174 and cgmcc 1.557 exhibited the best probiotic properties with the potential for use in the production of probiotic fermented foods.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == pathogen exclusion properties of canine probiotics are influenced by the growth media and physical treatments simulating industrial processes.
AB  == aims: manufacturing process used in preparation of probiotic products may alter beneficial properties of probiotics. the effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the protective properties of canine-originated probiotic  bacteria against adhesion of canine enteropathogens was investigated. methods and results: three established dog probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum vet9a, lactobacillus plantarum vet14a and lactobacillus rhamnosus vet16a, and their mixture were assessed using the dog mucus pathogen exclusion model. the pathogens used were enterococcus canis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and clostridium perfringens. the effect of growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacture conditions, and viability (viable and heat inactivated, 80 degrees c per 30 min) on the pathogen exclusion properties of probiotics were  characterized. greater pathogen exclusion percentages were noted for probiotics growing in conditions reflecting manufacture when compared to laboratory (p < 0.05). inactivation of probiotics by heat (80 degrees c per 30 min) increased pathogen exclusion compared with their viable forms (p < 0.05). conclusions: manufacturing process conditions such as growth media, incubation temperature and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the protective properties of the tested strains. significance and impact of the study: growing conditions and pretreatment methods should be carefully considered when designing new probiotics to reduce the risk of common infections in dogs. the studied probiotics are promising potential feed additives for dogs.

TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == effect of two probiotic strains of lactobacillus on in vitro adherence of listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococcus aureus to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == the lactobacilli probiotics maintain a normal vaginal biota and prevent disease recurrence. this microorganisms form a pellicle on the vaginal epithelium that acts as a biologic barrier against colonization by pathogenic bacteria. in this paper were realized assays of exclusion, competition, and displacement. for these test, vaginal epithelial cells, two strains of lactobacilli and pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes) were used. the lactobacilli strains showed a great capacity of adherence, with a mean of 83.5 +/- 26.67 lactobacillus fermentum cells and 56.2 +/- 20.87 lactobacillus rhamnosus cells per vaginal epithelial cells. l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus were able to reduce the adherence of s. aureus, s. agalactiae and l. monocytogenes in a significant level in this assay (p < 0.01).  the lactobacilli used in this study protect the vaginal epithelium through a series of barriers and interference mechanisms. the aim of present study was to assess the ability of vaginal lactobacillus strains, selected for their probiotic properties, to block the adherence of pathogenic microorganisms in vitro by displacement, competition, and exclusion mechanisms.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == effects of probiotics on the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis: a review.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common cause of genital discomfort in women in reproductive ages, which causes many complications. bacterial vaginosis  is usually treated by metronidazole and clindamycin. however, this protocol does  not prevent its recurrence, which is a main complaint of the patients. the number of lactobacilli in the vagina of women with bv is significantly lower than that in healthy women. hence, efforts have been made to normalize vaginal flora by oral or vaginal administration of lactobacilli. the objective of the present study was to review clinical evidences available regarding the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of bv. materials and methods: published randomized controlled trials were searched in pubmed, science direct, and the cochrane database between 1990 and 2011. search terms included bacterial  vaginosis, urinary tract infection, lactobacillus, and probiotics. results: orally consumed probiotics are believed to ascend to the vaginal tract after they are excreted from the rectum; vaginal administration allows for direct replacement of the probiotics for unhealthy vaginal microbiota and occupation of  specific adhesion sites at the epithelial surface of the urinary tract, which consequently results in maintenance of a low ph and production of antimicrobial substances like acids and hydrogen peroxide. receiving lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1, and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 at a dose of at least 10 cfu/day for 2 months has been shown to present the patients with better  results. conclusions: although the results of different studies are controversial, most studies have been in favor of the probiotics in the prevention or treatment of bv, and no adverse effects have been reported. therefore, it may be helpful to recommend daily consumption of probiotic products to improve public health among women.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces as potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages.
AB  == a total of 109 lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces were identified by partial 16s rrna, cpn60 and/or phes sequencing. lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by enterococcus (38%). lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. a further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant  genus in this type of product. lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. the best strains according to the results obtained were lactobacillus casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678, lactobacillus  rhamnosus ctc1679, l. gasseri ctc1700, l. gasseri ctc1704, lactobacillus fermentum ctc1693. those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. l. casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678 and l. rhamnosus ctc1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) cfu/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.

TI  == tailoring the probiotic potential of non-starter lactobacillus strains from ripened parmigiano reggiano cheese by in vitro screening and principal component  analysis.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) inhabiting fermented food have been recently revised as source of probiotic strains. here, we in vitro assessed the potential probiotic aptitude of a de-replicated set of nslab previously isolated  from long ripened parmigiano reggiano cheeses (22 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 18 lactobacillus paracasei, 3 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus harbinensis, and  2 lactobacillus fermentum). most strains showed moderate to good resistance to biological barriers, including bile salts, lysozyme, and simulated gastric and pancreatic juices. antimicrobial susceptibility tests against seven antimicrobials belonging to different categories showed that most strains are susceptible towards all the antibiotics, with the exception of vancomycin and streptomycin. the strains lost the streptomycin resistance when assayed on agar medium containing 0.5% bile salts, suggesting that detergent-like properties of cholic acids increase membrane permeability and mediate streptomycin susceptibility. no isolate showed bile salt hydrolase (bsh) activities, supporting that bile salts resistance and bsh activity are unpaired traits. finally, nslab strains had moderate to high auto-aggregative and hydrophobic phenotypes, whereas two subsets of 22 and 8 strains co-aggregated with escherichia coli and salmonella enterica s. typhimurium, respectively. a multivariate analysis was effective to segregate one l. casei and two l. rhamnosus strains showing physiological characteristics compatible with probiotic properties.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == anti-hiv-1 activity, protease inhibition and safety profile of extracts prepared  from rhus parviflora.
AB  == background: in the present study, extracts prepared from the leaves of rhus parviflora roxb. (anacardiaceae) were evaluated for their anti-hiv activity, which have been traditionally used for the treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, insomnia and epilepsy. methods: aqueous and 50% ethanolic extracts prepared from leaves of the plant were tested for their cytotoxicity and anti-hiv property using reporter gene based assays as well as human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls). further these extracts were evaluated for their ability to inhibit hiv-1 reverse transcriptase (rt) and protease activity. safety profile of the extracts was determined on viability of lactobacillus sp., secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by vaginal keratinocytes and transepithelial resistance. results: both aqueous (ic50 = 15 mug/ml) and 50% ethanolic (ic50 = 26 mug/ml) extracts prepared from leaves of r. parviflora showed anti-hiv activity in tzm-bl cells wherein the virus was treated with the extracts prior to infection. further, both the extracts also inhibited virus load in hiv infected cem-gfp cells and human pbls. the anti-hiv activity is mediated through inhibition of hiv-1 protease activity. both the extracts did not disturb the integrity of monolayer formed by intestinal epithelial caco-2 cells. the extracts when tested up to 100 mug/ml did not significantly reduce the viability of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. the extracts (100 mug/ml) did not reveal any cytotoxic effect on vaginal keratinocytes (vk2/e6e7). levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by vk2/e6e7 cells treated with both the plant extracts were within the non-inflammatory range. conclusions: the studies reported herein showed in vitro anti-hiv activity and preliminary safety profile  of the extracts prepared from the leaves of r. parviflora.

TI  == strain-dependent augmentation of tight-junction barrier function in human primary epidermal keratinocytes by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium lysates.
AB  == in this study, we investigated whether probiotic lysates can modify the tight-junction function of human primary keratinocytes. the keratinocytes were grown on cell culture inserts and treated with lysates from bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum,  or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. with the exception of l. fermentum (which decreased cell viability), all strains markedly enhanced tight-junction barrier function within 24 h, as assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (teer). however, b. longum and l. rhamnosus gg were the most efficacious, producing dose-dependent increases in resistance that were maintained for 4 days. these increases in teer correlated with elevated expression of tight-junction protein components. neutralization of toll-like receptor 2 abolished both the increase in teer and expression of tight-junction proteins induced by b. longum, but not l. rhamnosus gg. these data suggest that some bacterial strains increase tight-junction function via modulation of protein components but the different pathways involved may vary depending on the bacterial strain.

TI  == the effect of growth media and physical treatments on the adhesion properties of  canine probiotics.
AB  == aims: the manufacturing processes have been reported to influence the properties  of probiotics with potential impact on health properties. the aim was to investigate the effect of different growth media and inactivation methods on the  properties of canine-originated probiotic bacteria alone and in combination mixture. methods and results: three established dog probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum vet9a, lactobacillus plantarum vet14a and lactobacillus rhamnosus vet16a, and their combination mixture were evaluated for their adhesion to dog mucus. the effect of different growth media, one reflecting laboratory and the other manufacturing conditions, and inactivation methods (95 degrees c, 80 degrees c and uv irradiation) on the mucus adhesion of the probiotic strains was  characterized. evaluation of dog probiotics was supported by cell visualization using transmission electron microscopy (tem). higher adhesion percentage was reported for probiotic strains growing in laboratory rather than in manufacturing conditions (p < 0.05). inactivation by heat (95 degrees c, 80 degrees c) decreased the adhesion properties when strains were cultivated in soy-based growth media compared with those grown in mrs broth (p < 0.05). tem observations  uncovered differences in cell-surface components in nonviable forms of probiotic  strains as compared with their viable forms. conclusions: manufacturing process conditions such as growth media and pretreatment methods may significantly affect the adhesive ability of the tested strains. significance and impact of the study: growth conditions, growth media, pretreatment methods and different probiotic combinations should be carefully considered for quality control of existing probiotics and for identification of new probiotics for dogs. these may also have an impact on health benefits for the host.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == differential effect on cell-mediated immunity in human volunteers after intake of different lactobacilli.
AB  == probiotics are live microorganisms which have beneficial effects on the host when ingested in adequate amounts. probiotic bacteria may stimulate immune effector functions in a strain-specific manner. in this blind placebo-controlled trial, we investigated the effects on the immune system following daily intake of six different strains of lactobacilli or the gram-negative bacterium pseudomonas lundensis for 2 or 5 weeks. blood lymphocyte subsets were quantified by fluorescence activated cell sorter and the expression of activation and memory markers was determined. the bacterial strains were also examined for their capacity to adhere to human intestinal cells and to be phagocytosed by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. intake of lactobacillus plantarum strain 299v increased the expression of the activation marker cd25 (p = 0.01) on cd8(+) t cells and the memory cell marker cd45ro on cd4(+) t cells (p = 0.03), whereas intake of l. paracasei tended to expand the natural killer t (nk t) cell population (p = 0.06). the phagocytic activity of granulocytes was increased following intake of l. plantarum 299v, l. plantarum heal, l. paracasei or l. fermentum. in contrast, ingestion of l. rhamnosus decreased the expression of cd25 and cd45ro significantly within the cd4(+) cell population. the observed immune effects after in-vivo administration of the probiotic bacteria could not be predicted by either their adherence capacity or the in-vitro-induced cytokine  production. the stimulation of cd8(+) t cells and nk t cells suggests that intake of probiotic bacteria may enhance the immune defence against, e.g. viral infections or tumours.

TI  == inhibition of hiv and hsv infection by vaginal lactobacilli in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == background and the purpose of the study: the cervico-vaginal mucosa which is populated with microflora (mostly includes lactobacilli) is the portal of entry for sexually transmitted pathogens. methods: the in vitro anti-viral effect of vaginal and non-vaginal lactobacillus was evaluated using single cycle hiv-1 replication and hsv-2 plaque reduction assays. the xtt proliferation assay was used to monitor the cellular toxicity. the in vivo anti-hsv-1 activity was evaluated in balb/c mouse model by monitoring skin lesion and immune response development. results and major conclusion: dmem culture supernatant of l. gasseri and l. fermentum (ph 7.3) did not show toxic effect but inhibited 50% of hiv replication at 12 and 31% concentrations, respectively. co-culture of l. gasseri  (1000 cfu/ target cell) showed mild cytotoxicity but inhibited 68% of hiv replication. the supernatant of l. crispatus inhibited 50% of hsv replication at  4% and also co-culture of l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. crispatus revokes almost all of the hsv multiplication. culture supernatants of l. gasseri and l. crispatus had significant virucidal effect against the hiv and hsv and inhibited  hsv infection in a stage before viral entry to the target cells. alive l. gasseri cells showed high potential for inhibiting hsv-1 infection in vivo condition. current data indicates that lactobacilli supernatant encompasses components with  neutralizing activity against hiv and hsv and it would be a determinant factor for viral diseases transmission and promising lead for anti-viral probiotic design.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == alleviating effects of lactobacillus strains on pathogenic vibrio parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fluid accumulation in the mouse model.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the probiotic effects of lactobacillus strains against vibrio parahaemolyticus causing gastroenteritis. six-week-old icr mice were pretreated with four lactobacillus strains at three dosages, and then challenged with v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 (serotype o3:k6). the results showed that v. parahaemolyticus tgqx01 caused severe intestinal fluid accumulation (fa)  and villi damage in control mice which were pretreated with phosphate-buffered saline. in contrast, significant alleviation of fa was seen in mice pretreated by with a high dose of lactobacillus strains (p < 0.05, n = 6) but not in mice that  received low-dose pretreatments. among middle-dose treatments, two highly adhesive strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus h15 and lactobacillus brevis y29-4, significantly decreased intestinal fa and villi damage in treated mice (p < 0.05). two low-adhesive strains, lactobacillus acidophilus y14-3 and lactobacillus fermentum f16-6, had no significant alleviating effects. at the same dosing levels, no significant differences in fa were observed in mice pretreated with strains with similar adhesive abilities but different antagonistic activities. our findings suggest that lactobacillus strains can alleviate v. parahaemolyticus-induced intestinal fa in mice, and the doses required for in vivo efficacy depend more on adhesive ability than on the antibacterial activity of strains.

TI  == characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolates and their inoculating effects on the silage fermentation at high temperature.
AB  == thermotolerant strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were screened for their suitability for silage making at high temperatures. four selected strains were identified by 16s rrna sequencing analyses and added to unwilted and wilted italian ryegrass for ensiling at 45 degrees c. all four strains (ht1, ht2, ht3 and ht4) grew at 50 degrees c and ph 4.0. strains ht1 and ht2 were identified as  lactobacillus rhamnosus; ht3 and ht4 were identified as lact. fermentum. strains  ht1 and ht2 were the most effective at improving the fermentation quality of italian ryegrass silage, irrespective of wilting, as indicated by lower ph values, less nh(3) -n, and more lactic acid. in contrast, strains ht3, ht4 and a  commercial inoculant consisting of lact. plantarum and pediococcus acidilactici conferred no or reduced benefits. wilting alone did not improve the fermentation  quality of italian ryegrass at 45 degrees c. inoculating with thermotolerant lact. rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 could improve the fermentation quality of silage at high temperatures. lactobacillus rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 can be used as inoculants  for silage making in the tropics and subtropics and could play an important role  in developing silage production in such regions. significance and impact of the study: grasses are often difficult to ensile in the tropics and subtropics because of the high temperatures there. to solve this problem, we screened for thermotolerant lactic acid bacteria and obtained two valuable strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, ht1 and ht2, which proved to be beneficial to silage fermentation at high temperatures. lactobacillus rhamnosus ht1 and ht2 can be used as inoculants for silage making in the tropics and subtropics, and will play an important role in developing silage production in such regions.

TI  == stable integration and expression of heterologous genes in several lactobacilli using an integration vector constructed from the integrase and attp sequences of  phage phiat3 isolated from lactobacillus casei atcc 393.
AB  == an integration vector capable of stably integrating and maintaining in the chromosomes of several lactobacilli over hundreds of generations has been constructed. the major integration machinery used is based on the phiat3 integrase (int) and attp sequences determined previously. a novel core sequence located at the 3' end of the trna(leu) gene is identified in lactobacillus fermentum atcc 14931 as the integration target by the integration vector though most of such sequences found in other lactobacilli are similar to that determined previously. due to the lack of an appropriate attb site in lactococcus lactis mg1363, the integration vector is found to be unable to integrate into the chromosome of the strain. however, such integration can be successfully restored  by cotransforming the integration vector with a replicative one harboring both attb and erythromycin resistance sequences into the strain. furthermore, the integration vector constructed carries a promoter region of plact from the chromosome of lactobacillus rhamnosus tcell-1 which is used to express green fluorescence and luminance protein genes in the lactobacilli studied.

TI  == fermentation of sugars and sugar alcohols by plaque lactobacillus strains.
AB  == objective: the objective was to analyse the ability of lactobacillus strains isolated from supragingival plaque of subjects with hyposalivation and from healthy controls to ferment sugars and sugar alcohols. material and methods: fifty strains isolated from interproximal plaque from subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (25 strains), subjects with primary sjogren's syndrome (16 strains) and from subjects with normal salivary secretion rate (9 strains) were tested. growth and ph were determined after 24 and 48 h of anaerobic incubation in vials containing basal media with 1 % of glucose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol or xylitol. results: no differences between strains isolated from hyposalivated subjects and controls were detected. all strains lowered the ph to <5.0 from fructose and the majority of the strains from glucose and sucrose. a ph of <5.5 was seen for 52 % of the strains using mannitol, 50 % using sorbitol and 36 % using xylitol. the ability to produce acids from sugars and sugar alcohols was highest among strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei and lowest among lactobacillus fermentum strains. conclusion: a large number of lactobacillus strains are able to ferment not only sugars but also the sugar substitutes mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol to ph levels critical for enamel demineralisation. clinical relevance: our findings suggest that products containing mannitol, sorbitol and/or xylitol may contribute to the acidogenic potential of the dental  plaque and especially in hyposalivated subjects with high numbers of lactobacilli.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == antifungal activity of two lactobacillus strains with potential probiotic properties.
AB  == aflatoxin (highly toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by fungi) contamination is a serious problem worldwide. modern agriculture and animal production systems need to use high-quality and mycotoxin-free feedstuffs. the use of microorganisms to preserve food has gained importance in recent years due  to the demand for reduced use of chemical preservatives by consumers. lactic acid bacteria are known to produce various antimicrobial compounds that are considered to be important in the biopreservation of food and feed. lactobacillus rhamnosus  l60 and lactobacillus fermentum l23 are producers of secondary metabolites, such  as organic acids, bacteriocins and, in the case of l60, hydrogen peroxide. the antifungal activity of lactobacilli strains was determined by coculture with aspergillus section flavi strains by two qualitative and one quantitative methods. both l23 and l60 completely inhibited the fungal growth of all aflatoxicogenic strains assayed. aflatoxin b (1) production was reduced 95.7-99.8% with l60 and 27.5-100% with l23. statistical analysis of the data revealed the influence of l60 and l23 on growth parameters and aflatoxin b (1) production. these results are important given that these aflatoxicogenic fungi are natural contaminants of feed used for animal production, and could be effectively controlled by lactobacillus l60 and l23 strains with probiotic properties.

AB  == twenty-four acid- and bile-tolerant lactobacilli isolates from dairy products were identified and further in vitro characterized for the presence of functional traits potentially useful for probiotic applications, which included desirable and undesirable traits, such as biofilm formation, ability to inhibit intestinal  pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility, and enzyme activity. the majority of examined strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents (streptomycin,  gentamicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin-dalfopristin),  except for three strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus with minimal inhibitory concentration levels for streptomycin higher than the microbiological breakpoints (>/=32 mug/ml), which are considered as resistant. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase, and moderate and high beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in nine strains, which were eliminated from further examination together with three isolates showing unsuitable antibiotic resistance. of the remaining 12 isolates, 4 (lactobacillus fermentum 202, lactobacillus gallinarum 7001, l. rhamnosus 183, and lactobacillus plantarum l2-1) manifested an outstanding potential to inhibit selected intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including escherichia coli and salmonella spp., and simultaneously demonstrated strong biofilm-forming capacity. in conclusion, the results of our in vitro experiments showed that the above four strains had a potential probiotic value and met the criteria to be identified as a possible probiotic microorganism, with the necessity of verification through well-designed in vivo experimental, clinical, and technological studies before the strains can be used  as probiotics or as starter probiotic cultures.

AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == synergistic effect between two bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances produced by lactobacilli strains with inhibitory activity for streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) are bacterial species that colonize the vagina in pregnant women and as such may cause serious infections in neonates that passed through the birth channel. the objective of this work was to study the inhibitory activities produced by each bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) of lactobacillus rhamnosus l60 and lactobacillus fermentum l23, and the effects of the combined blis-es of these lactobacilli on gbs. the interactions between the blis-es were assessed by qualitative and quantitative methods on agar plates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and fractional inhibitory concentrations (fics) were determined by a modification of the broth microdilution and checkerboard methods, respectively. antibiotic susceptibilities of all s. agalactiae strains were assayed and the results of these tests were evaluated for statistical significance. a 7.5% of gbs isolates were recovered from 760 pregnant women and 91% of those strains were susceptible to each blis produced by l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and also to a mixture of them. the comparisons among the blis-es showed statistically significant differences, with a combination of the blis-es from the two lactobacillus species being better than the blis of each one alone (p < 0.05) as gbs growth inhibitors. synergistic activities between the blis-es were found on 100% of susceptible gbs strains, mics ranges of blis of l23 and l60 were 80-160 and 160-320 ua ml(-1), respectively. by the checkerboard method, the blis-es combination showed synergistic effect on all sensitive strains tested, with values of fics ranging from 0.131 to 0.218. the blis-es produced by these lactobacilli of vaginal origin were able to inhibit s. agalactiae isolates. the results indicate that these strains may have probiotic potential for the control of gbs in women and may consequently prevent gbs infections in newborns.

TI  == differential targeting of the e-cadherin/beta-catenin complex by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli improves epithelial barrier function.
AB  == the intestinal ecosystem is balanced by dynamic interactions between resident and incoming microbes, the gastrointestinal barrier, and the mucosal immune system. however, in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), where the integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier is compromised, resident microbes contribute to the development and perpetuation of inflammation and disease. probiotic bacteria  have been shown to exert beneficial effects, e.g., enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. however, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are only poorly understood. here, we comparatively investigated the effects of four probiotic lactobacilli, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. gasseri, and l. rhamnosus, in a t84 cell epithelial barrier model. results of dna microarray experiments indicating that lactobacilli modulate the regulation of genes encoding in particular adherence junction proteins such as e-cadherin and beta-catenin were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr).  furthermore, we show that epithelial barrier function is modulated by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli via their effect on adherence junction protein expression and complex formation. in addition, incubation with lactobacilli differentially influences the phosphorylation of adherence junction  proteins and the abundance of protein kinase c (pkc) isoforms such as pkcdelta that thereby positively modulates epithelial barrier function. further insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by these probiotics might also foster the development of novel strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal  diseases (e.g., ibd).

TI  == ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis sensitivity to bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilli strains.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to determine the inhibitory activities of two bacteriocins, produced by lactobacilli, against genital mycoplasmas. in this  study, infections produced by genital mycoplasmas were studied; of these, 1.3% were caused by mycoplasma hominis, 10.7% by ureaplasma urealyticum and 5.6% by u. urealyticum + m. hominis. u. urealyticum was isolated from 75 out of 123 patients with genital mycoplasmas, while m. hominis was isolated from 9 patients (7.3%) and both u. urealyticum and m. hominis from 39 patients (31.7%). bacteriocins, l23 and l60, produced by lactobacillus fermentum and l. rhamnosus, respectively,  appear to be two novel inhibitors of bacterial infection with potential antibacterial activity. both bacteriocins proved to be active against 100% of strains tested; mics of bacteriocin l23 ranged between 320 and 160 ua ml(-1) for  78% of the m. hominis strains and between 320 and 80 ua ml(-1) for 95% of the u.  urealyticum strains. in addition, bacteriocin l60 was still active at 160 ua ml(-1) for a high percentage (56%) of m. hominis strains, and at 80 ua ml(-1) for 53% of the u. urealyticum strains. interestingly, these antimicrobial substances  produced by lactobacilli showed an inhibitory activity against genital mycoplasmas even when diluted. altogether, our study indicates that the bacteriocins, l23 and l60, are good candidates for the treatment or prevention of genital infections in women.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == lactobacillus species in supragingival plaque in subjects with hyposalivation.
AB  == the aim of the study was to analyse the frequency of different lactobacillus species in relation to the ph-lowering potential of the plaque. methods: ten subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation (rt group) and 10 subjects with primary sjogren's syndrome (pss group) and matched controls with normal salivary  secretion were included. lactobacillus species were selected from their growth on rogosa agar and identified by pcr and restriction fragment length polymorphism using haeiii and hpaii restriction enzymes. results: lactobacilli were isolated from 14 subjects (6 rt, 3 pss, 5 controls). the most prevalent species were lactobacillus fermentum (7 subjects), lactobacillus casei (7 subjects) and lactobacillus rhamnosus (6 subjects). l. fermentum and l. casei were the most prevalent species in anterior sites and l. rhamnosus and l. fermentum in posterior sites. in anterior sites, hyposalivated subjects with high lactobacillus counts had an increased plaque acidogenicity compared to those with low counts. in posterior sites, subjects with high lactobacillus counts had a lower final ph compared with those with low counts. conclusion: there were large  intra- and inter-individual variations in frequencies of lactobacillus species and lactobacillus counts, but no specific species could be related to plaque acidogenicity.

TI  == effect of stress pretreatment on survival of probiotic bacteria in gastrointestinal tract simulator.
AB  == the effect of stress pretreatment on survival of probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, and lactobacillus fermentum me-3 cultures was investigated in the single bioreactor gastrointestinal tract simulator (gits). the cultures were pregrown in ph-auxostat, subjected to temperature, acid, or bile stress treatment, fast frozen in liquid nitrogen (ln(2)), and tested for survival in gits. after ln(2) freezing the colony forming ability of l. rhamnosus gg and l. fermentum me-3 nonstressed and stressed cells was well retained (average survival of 75.4 +/- 18.3% and 88.0 +/- 7.2%, respectively). l. acidophilus la-5 strain showed good survival of auxostat nonstressed cells after fast freezing (94.2 +/- 15.0), however the survival of stress pretreated cells was considerably lower (30.8 +/- 8.5%). all ln(2) frozen  auxostat cultures survived well in the acid phase of the git simulation (survival 81 +/- 21%); however, after the bile phase, the colony formation ability of l. acidophilus la-5, l. rhamnosus gg, and l. fermentum me-3 decreased by approximately 1.4 +/- 0.2, 3.8 +/- 0.3, and 3.5 +/- 1.2 logarithmic units, respectively. no statistically relevant positive effect of stress pretreatments on survival of ln(2) frozen l. acidophilus la-5, l. rhamnosus gg, and l. fermentum me-3 in gits was observed.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria efficiently protect human and animal intestinal epithelial and immune cells from enteric virus infection.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the potential antiviral activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) using animal and human intestinal and macrophage cell line models  of non tumor origin. to this end, lab strains selected on the basis of previous in vitro trials were co-incubated with cell line monolayers, which were subsequently challenged with rotavirus (rv) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (tgev). in order to elucidate the possible mechanism responsible for the antiviral activity, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ros) release as well as the attachment ability of lab on the cell lines was investigated. various strains were found to exhibit moderate to complete monolayer protection against viral rv or tgev disruption. highest protection effects were recorded with the known probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactobacillus casei shirota against both rv and tgev, while notable antiviral activity was also attributed to enterococcus faecium pck38, lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc179, lactobacillus pentosus pca227 and lactobacillus plantarum pca236 and pcs22, depending on the cell line and virus combination used. a variable increase (of up to 50%) on the release of no(-) and h(2)o(2) (ros) was obtained when lab strains were co-incubated with the cell lines, but the results were found to be lab strain and cell line specific, apart from a small number of strains which were able to induce strong ros release in more than one cell line. in contrast, the ability of the examined lab strains to attach to the cell line monolayers was lab strain but not cell line specific. highest attachment ability was observed with l. plantarum aca-dc 146, l. paracasei subsp. tolerans aca-dc 4037 and e. faecium pcd71. clear  indications on the nature of the antiviral effect were evident only in the case of the l. casei shirota against tgev and with l. plantarum pca236 against both rv and tgev. in the rest of the cases, each interaction was lab-cell line-virus specific, barring general conclusions. however, it is probable that more than one mechanism is involved in the antiviral effect described here. further investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mode of action and to develop a cell line model as a system for selection of probiotic strains suited for farm animal applications.

TI  == probiotic attributes of lactobacillus strains isolated from food and of human origin.
AB  == lactobacilli isolated from various sources were identified on the basis of 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic region amplification and subsequent sequencing of the smaller intergenic region. an in vitro analysis of probiotic properties including binding, ability to tolerate different concentrations of bile, survival in acidic buffer and antimicrobial activity of four different isolates and two standard strains (lactobacillus plantarum american type culture collection (atcc) 8014 and l. rhamnosus gg (lgg)) was carried out. the ability of each isolate to stimulate caco-2 cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and thp-1 cells resulting in immunomodulation of these cells was analysed. isolates l. rhamnosus cs25 and l. delbrueckii m and standard strain atcc 8014 showed broad antimicrobial activity, and isolates cs25 (percentage of survival 6.9 % at ph 2.5, 5.1 % at ph 2.0) and l. plantarum cs23 (5.7 % at ph 2.5, 4.9 % at ph 2.0) have shown good tolerance to acidic ph. isolate cs23 showed a good survival (14 %) after 2 h incubation in de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) medium containing 3 %  bile salts. isolates cs23, cs25 and l. fermentum ast1 could stimulate caco-2 cells, human pbmc and thp-1 cells for a strong and varied immunomodulatory response in these cells. though lgg showed poor antimicrobial activity as well as bile and acid tolerance, it was found to be the best binding strain tested. child faecal isolate cs23 from the present study showed high binding ability (seventeen bacteria/caco-2), high tolerance to acidic ph and bile salts and significant immunomodulation; therefore it is a good potential probiotic candidate.

TI  == antimicrobial activity, inhibition of urogenital pathogens, and synergistic interactions between lactobacillus strains.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum strain l23 and l. rhamnosus strain l60 were selected as an alternative treatment to prevent or treat urogenital infections based on their probiotic properties and production of bacteriocins. the objectives of the present work were to study the inhibitory activities of these two bacteriocin-producing strains, and to analyze the interactions between pairs of bacteriocins that inhibit urogenital pathogens. antimicrobial activity tests of l23 and l60 were performed by a diffusion method with 207 bacterial strains, isolated from female patients presenting a urogenital infection. inhibitory substances interaction tests were carried out by using a streak-diffusion method  on agar plates. one hundred percent of the clinical isolates showed sensitivity to the antimicrobial substances produced by l23 and l60. the selected lactobacilli produced larger inhibition halos when compared to several antibiotics commonly used for treating these infections. synergistic interactions and indifferent interactions were recorded in 68.6% and 31.4% of the cases, respectively. no antagonistic interactions were observed. in conclusion, the bacteriocin-producing strains l23 and l60 are potential candidates for probiotic  prophylaxis and treatment of urogenital disorders in women.

TI  == lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  == a group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ecc) affected children treated in the department of pedodontics (children's teaching hospital, brno, czech republic). biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by api 50 ch kit and conventional tube tests. the rep-pcr fingerprinting with the (gtg)(5) primer was  used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. in total, 20 strains of lactobacillus fermentum, 17 l. rhamnosus, 14 l. casei/paracasei, 7 l. gasseri, 7 l. salivarius  and 4 l. plantarum were identified. mixtures of two or even three lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. results obtained by biotyping and (gtg)(5)-pcr were generally comparable except for l. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. the (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. our  results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacillus strains as adjunct cultures for cheese making: in vitro  characterization and performance in two model cheeses.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria are the main uncontrolled factor in today's industrial cheese making and may be the cause of quality inconsistencies and defects in cheeses. in this context, adjunct cultures of selected lactobacilli from nonstarter lactic acid bacteria origin appear as the best alternative to indirectly control cheese biota. the objective of the present work was to study the technological properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from cheese by in  vitro and in situ assays. milk acidification kinetics and proteolytic and acidifying activities were assessed, and peptide mapping of trichloroacetic acid  8% soluble fraction of milk cultures was performed by liquid chromatography. in addition, the tolerance to salts (nacl and kcl) and the phage-resistance were investigated. four strains were selected for testing as adjunct cultures in cheese making experiments at pilot plant scale. in in vitro assays, most strains  acidified milk slowly and showed weak to moderate proteolytic activity. fast strains decreased milk ph to 4.5 in 8 h, and continued acidification to 3.5 in 12 h or more. this group consisted mostly of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus rhamnosus strains. approximately one-third of the slow strains, which comprised mainly lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus curvatus, were capable to grow when milk was supplemented with glucose and casein hydrolysate. peptide maps were similar to those of lactic acid bacteria considered to have a moderate proteolytic activity. most strains showed  salt tolerance and resistance to specific phages. the lactobacillus strains selected as adjunct cultures for cheese making experiments reached 10(8) cfu/g in soft cheeses at 7 d of ripening, whereas they reached 10(9) cfu/g in semihard cheeses after 15 d of ripening. in both cheese varieties, the adjunct culture population remained at high counts during all ripening, in some cases overcoming  or equaling primary starter. overall, proximate composition of cheeses with and without added lactobacilli did not differ; however, some of the tested strains continued acidifying during ripening, which was mainly noticed in soft cheeses and affected overall quality of the products. the lactobacilli strains with low acidifying activity showed appropriate technological characteristics for their use as adjunct cultures in soft and semihard cheeses.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with  the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.

TI  == nonstarter lactobacilli isolated from soft and semihard argentinean cheeses: genetic characterization and resistance to biological barriers.
AB  == nonstarter lactic acid bacteria isolated from argentinean cheeses were identified and characterized by focusing on their resistance to biological barriers, along with other physiological features of potential interest, in the search for future probiotic organisms. lactobacilli were enumerated and isolated from semihard and  soft cheeses made with multistrain streptococcus thermophilus starters. lactobacilli counts in 1-week-old cheeses were between 10(5) and 10(7) cfu/g and  then reached 10(7) cfu/ g in all 1-month samples, while streptococci were always  above 10(9) cfu/g. a total number of 22 lactobacilli isolates were retained, identified, and characterized by in vitro tests. species identity was determined  by carbohydrate metabolism and species-specific pcr assays. genetic diversity was explored by random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) pcr analysis. the lactobacillus strains were assigned to the species l. casei, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, and l. perolens. all the strains studied tolerated 25 ppm of lysozyme, and most of them showed resistance to 0.3% bile. after incubation in gastric solution (ph 2.0), counts decreased by several log units, ranging from 3.2 to 7.0. the strains were able to grow in the presence of  bile salts, but only three isolates were capable of deconjugation. the nonstarter lactobacilli that were assayed fermented the prebiotic substrates (especially lactulose and inulin). some strains showed high cell hydrophobicity and beta-galactosidase activity, as well as inhibitory activity against pathogenic bacteria. it was concluded that most of the lactobacilli isolated in this study demonstrated resistance to biological barriers and physiological characteristics  compatible with probiotic properties, which make them suitable for further research in in vivo studies aimed at identifying new probiotic organisms.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum br11, a potential new probiotic, alleviates symptoms of colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (dss) in rats.
AB  == current treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are relatively ineffective. recently, probiotics have emerged as a potential treatment modality  for numerous gastrointestinal disorders, including ibd. few probiotics, however,  have undergone appropriate preclinical screening in vivo. the current study compared the effects of four candidate probiotics on development of dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis in rats. sprague dawley rats were gavaged 1  ml of the potential probiotic (1 x 10(10) cfu/ml), or vehicle, twice daily for 14 days. strains tested were lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), streptococcus thermophilus th-4 (th-4), bifidobacterium lactis bb12 (bb12) and lactobacillus fermentum br11 (br11). colitis was induced from day 7 to 14 via administration of 2% dss in drinking water. disease activity index (dai) was monitored daily until  rats were killed at day 14. dai decreased in dss+bb12 and dss+br11 compared to dss+vehicle. colon length increased in dss+br11 (10%) and dss+lgg (10%) compared  to dss+vehicle. dss+bb12 and dss+br11 prevented the distal colon crypt hyperplasia evident in dss+vehicle, dss+lgg and dss+th-4. br11 was most effective at reducing colitic symptoms. bb12 had minimal effects, whilst th-4 did not prevent dss-colitis and lgg actually exacerbated some indicators of colitis. further studies into the potential benefits of l. fermentum br11 are indicated.

AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == induction of interleukin-12 by lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion.
AB  == some strains of lactobacilli can stimulate macrophages and dendritic cells to secrete il-12, which plays a key role in activating innate immunity. we examined  the il-12-inducing ability of 47 lactobacillus strains belonging to 10 species in mouse peritoneal macrophages, and characterized the properties important for the  induction of il-12. although considerable differences in il-12-inducing ability were observed among the strains tested, almost all strains belonging to the lactobacillus casei group (l. casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus zeae) or to lactobacillus fermentum induced high levels of il-12. phagocytosis of lactobacilli was necessary for il-12 induction, and the strains with strong il-12 induction were relatively resistant to lysis in the macrophages. the sensitivity  of lactobacillus strains to in vitro treatment with m-1 enzyme, a member of the n-acetylmuramidases, was negatively correlated with il-12-inducing ability. using a probiotic strain, l. casei strain shirota (lcs), we showed that the cell wall of lcs could be digested by long-term treatment with a high dose of m-1 enzyme and that the il-12-inducing ability was diminished according to the duration of the enzyme treatment. the soluble polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex released from the cell wall of lcs did not induce il-12, whereas the insoluble intact cell wall of lcs induced il-12. these results suggest that the intact cell wall structure of lactobacilli is an important element in the ability to induce il-12  and that lactobacillus strains having a rigid cell wall resistant to intracellular digestion effectively stimulate macrophages to induce il-12.

TI  == probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review.
AB  == vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) is a common infection affecting the quality of life of many women. probiotics have been investigated as possible agents for the  prevention of recurrences of vvc. we reviewed the available literature. in some studies the development of vvc was associated with either a low number of lactobacilli in the vagina or with the presence of h2o2-non-producing vaginal lactobacilli, although there are a few studies not supporting these statements. in addition, in vitro studies have shown that lactobacilli can inhibit the growth of candida albicans and/or its adherence on the vaginal epithelium. the results of some clinical trials support the effectiveness of lactobacilli, especially lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, administered either orally or intravaginally in colonizing the vagina and/or preventing the colonization and infection of the vagina by c. albicans, while the results of a small number of clinical trials do not corroborate these findings. nevertheless, most of the relevant clinical trials had methodological problems such as small sample size, no control group (placebo) and included women without confirmed recurrent vvc, and thus they are not reliable for drawing definitive conclusions. thus, the available evidence for the use of probiotics for prevention of recurrent vvc is limited. however, the empirical use of probiotics may be considered in women with frequent recurrence of vvc (more than three episodes per year), especially for those who have adverse effects from or contraindications for the use of antifungal agents, since adverse effects of probiotics are very rare. in any case women should be clearly informed about the unproven usefulness of probiotics for this purpose. in conclusion, despite the promising results of some studies, further research is needed to prove the effectiveness of probiotics in preventing the recurrences of vvc and to allow their wide use for this indication.

AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin and a listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage  endolysin produced and secreted by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the expression and secretion signals of the sep protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11 were used to direct export of two peptidoglycan hydrolases by lb.  fermentum br11, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917 and lactococcus lactis mg1363. the production levels, hydrolytic and bacteriocidal activities of the listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase endolysin ply511 and the glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin were examined. buffering of the growth media to a neutral ph allowed detection of ply511 and lysostaphin peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity from all lactic acid bacteria. it was found that purified ply511 has a ph activity range similar to that of lysostaphin with both enzymes functioning optimally under alkaline conditions. supernatants from lactobacilli expressing lysostaphin reduced viability of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) by approximately 8 log(10) cfu/ml compared to controls. however, supernatants containing ply511 were unable to control l. monocytogenes growth. in coculture experiments, both lb. plantarum and lb. fermentum synthesizing lysostaphin were able to effectively reduce mrsa cell numbers by >7.4 and 1.7 log(10)cfu/ml, respectively, while lactic acid bacteria secreting ply511 were unable to significantly inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes. our results demonstrate that lysostaphin and ply511 can be expressed in an active form from different lactic acid bacteria and lysostaphin showed superior killing activity.  lactobacilli producing lysostaphin may have potential for in situ biopreservation in foodstuffs or for prevention of s. aureus infections.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == lactobacillus bacteremia, species identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility of 85 blood isolates.
AB  == background: data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical lactobacillus isolates are scarce, and appropriate interpretation criteria for susceptibility tests are not available. methods: we examined 85 cases of lactobacillus bacteremia, of which 47 cases have been included in our previous studies. overall, 14 antimicrobial agents were evaluated by the e-test method, and these results were compared with disk diffusion test findings. the clinical outcomes of the patients and their antimicrobial treatments were registered. results: the antimicrobial susceptibility of lactobacillus strains was species dependent. the  considerable number of lactobacillus rhamnosus (n=46), lactobacillus fermentum (n=12), and lactobacillus casei (n=12) strains available for testing made it possible to compare the susceptibilities within 1 species, as well. of the 46 l.  rhamnosus isolates, 22 were identified as l. rhamnosus gg type by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. all lactobacillus isolates demonstrated low minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin. mics of vancomycin were high (>256 microg/ml) for  all other species except lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus jensenii. disk diffusion and e-test results were concordant. the mics of cephalosporins varied;  cefuroxime demonstrated a higher level of activity than did ceftriaxone. benzylpenicillin and ampicillin mics had variable ranges between different species. combination therapy was given to 83% of the patients, but, in 54% of them, therapy included only 1 microbiologically active agent, according to results of the susceptibility tests. mortality at 1 week was 12% among patients who presumably were receiving adequate treatment and 27% among patients who were  receiving inadequate treatment (p=.131, by e-test). conclusion: most clinical lactobacillus blood isolates demonstrated low mics of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin, but they had variable susceptibility to penicillin and cephalosporins.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == [antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  == objective: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. design: review of literature. setting: charles university at prague, pharmaceutical faculty at hradec kralove. methods: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. conclusions: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. the efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of c. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. essential oils present in the cayenne pepper (capsodum  frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against c. albicans as well. clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. the effects of chinese leek are similar to garlic. propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the  yeast strains decreases in the following order: c. albicans > c. tropicalis > c.  crusei > c. guilliermondii. its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. tea trea oil (melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for c. crusei and c. norvengensis. in the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of lactobacilus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, b-54 may be recommended. moreover there are suitable strains  of l. brevis cd-2, l. salivarius fv-2, l. gasseri mb 335, l. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (l. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (l. gasseri). the strains of l. acidophilus crl 1294 and l. salivarius crl 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with candida. it should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of lactobacillus (especially l. casei and l. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract.  no protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin e, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.

TI  == strain-specific effects of probiotics on gut barrier integrity following hemorrhagic shock.
AB  == probiotic therapy modulates the composition of the intestinal flora and inhibits  the inflammatory response. these properties may be of benefit in the preservation of gut barrier integrity after injury or stress. in this study, we examined the effect of two lactobacillus strains selected for their pathogen exclusion properties on intestinal barrier integrity following hemorrhagic shock. additionally, the responsiveness of the macrophage cell line raw 264.7 to combined exposure to lactobacillus dna or oligodeoxynucleotides containing cpg motifs (cpg-odn) and endotoxin was assessed by measuring tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) release. rats were administered lactobacilli (5 x 10(9) cfu) or vehicle for 7 days and were subjected subsequently to hemorrhagic shock by withdrawal of 2.1 ml blood/100 g tissue. levels of plasma endotoxin, bacterial translocation to distant organs, and filamentous actin (f-actin) in the ileum were determined 24 h later. rats treated with lactobacillus rhamnosus showed reduced levels of plasma endotoxin (8 +/- 2 pg/ml versus 24 +/- 4 pg/ml; p = 0.01), bacterial translocation (2 cfu/gram versus 369 cfu/gram; p < 0.01), and disruption of f-actin distribution following hemorrhagic shock compared with nontreated control rats. in contrast, pretreatment with lactobacillus fermentum had no substantial effect on gut barrier integrity. interestingly, dna preparations from both lactobacilli reduced endotoxin-induced tnf-alpha release dose dependently, whereas cpg-odn increased tnf-alpha release. in conclusion, the pathogen exclusion properties of both lactobacillus strains and the reduction of  endotoxin-induced inflammation by their dna in vitro are not prerequisites for a  beneficial effect of probiotic therapy on gut barrier function following hemorrhagic shock. although pretreatment with lactobacillus spp. may be useful to preserve gut barrier integrity following severe hypotension, a thorough assessment of specific strains seems to be essential.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == lactobacilli for prevention of urogenital infections: a review.
AB  == urogenital infections are a worldwide shared problem that represent the most common reason for a woman to decide to visit to gynaecologist or urologist. the origin of the uropathogens in uncomplicated urinary tract infection and bacterial vaginosis is the fecal flora. key element of pathogenesis namely the ability of the pathogens to survive exposure to the microflora that exists on the external urogenitalia, in which lactobacilli predominate. some health food appear to contain > or = 1 common lactobacillus strain; l. rhamnosus gr-1 was found to be the best of a group of 34 lactobacillus strains isolated from dairy, poultry, health food. recently has been reported the first clinical evidence that probiotic lactobacilli can be delivered to the vagina following oral intake. these l. strains possess the ability to adhere to and colonize tissues and the capacity to inhibit the pathogenesis of disease-causing organisms that make them  effective probiotic agents. in particularly, two strains, lactobacillus gg and lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 appear to be effective at colonizing and protecting  the intestine and urogenital tract, respectively, against microbial infection. treating and preventing urogenital infection by instillating probiotic organisms  has great appeal to patients and caregivers. the ability to administer orally l.  rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14, which colonize the intestine and vagina, provides a major step in the right direction for patients as it potentially allows for the self administration of therapy.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == the potential of dairy lactic acid bacteria to metabolise amino acids via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination.
AB  == the metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing  cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. there were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. alanine and aspartate were utilised by some lab and accumulated during  the incubation of other lab. arginine was degraded not only by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum. of the lab studied, lb. brevis and lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. the formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. these findings suggest that the potential of lab for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of lab and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.

TI  == probiotics and the urologist.
AB  == emerging from the stigma of once being referred to as "snake oil", excellent scientific and clinical evidence now exists to indicate that probiotics do indeed have a role to play in medicine. the proper definition of probiotics is important "live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health  benefit on the host", for several reasons. it rules out so-called probiotics that have no clinically proven, peer-reviewed data, and it states the need to have viable bacteria present, unlike these pseudo products which are often wrongly labeled, poorly manufactured, with low or no viability at time of use. guidelines, prepared by the united nations and world health organization are now  available to guide physicians and consumers as to the types of strains with documented benefits. in urology, the most studied strains are lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum b-54 and rc-14. their use daily in oral form, or  once to three times weekly as a vaginal suppository, have been shown to reduce the urogenital pathogen load and the risk of urinary tract and vaginal infections. organisms such as oxalobacter formigenes, still in the r&d phase, offer great potential to reduce kidney stone formation via oxalate degradation in the intestine. some studies using l. casei shirota suggest a possible effect against bladder cancer, while studies using l. plantarum 299 show significantly reduced infection rates in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. in short, specific probiotic strains hold much promise for use in the urology setting.

AB  == urogenital infections afflict an estimated one billion people each year. the size of this problem and the increased prevalence of multi-drug resistant pathogens make it imperative that alternative remedies be found. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 64 healthy women given daily oral capsules of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 60 days showed no adverse effects. microscopy analysis showed restoration from asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis microflora to a normal lactobacilli colonized microflora in 37% women during lactobacilli treatment compared to 13% on placebo (p=0.02). lactobacilli were detected in more women in the lactobacilli-treated group than in the placebo group at 28 day (p=0.08) and 60 day (p=0.05) test points. culture  findings confirmed a significant increase in vaginal lactobacilli at day 28 and 60, a significant depletion in yeast at day 28 and a significant reduction in coliforms at day 28, 60 and 90 for lactobacilli-treated subjects versus controls. the combination of probiotic l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14 is not only safe for daily use in healthy women, but it can reduce colonization of the vagina by potential pathogenic bacteria and yeast.

AB  == several forces are driving an expanded use of nutraceuticals, particularly functional foods and probiotics, as instruments of the restoration and maintenance of well-being. these include consumer desire to use natural rather than pharmaceutical products, the mounting scientific evidence that shows efficacy of certain nutraceutical products, and the increasing cost and continued failure of drugs to cure or prevent disease. there is now a strong scientific basis for use of cranberries to reduce the risk of e. coli adhesion to bladder cells and the onset of urinary tract infection. there is also a mechanistic basis and clinical support for use of lactobacillus strains such as l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14 to colonize the intestine and vagina and reduce the risk of intestinal and urogenital infections. for such alternative approaches to be successful, scientific rigor must be backed by public education and physician acceptance. given the emergence of virulent and multidrug-resistant pathogens, time is not on our side.

TI  == genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. methods and results: thirty-five lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16s rrna genes were determined and compared with existing data in  genbank. a phylogenetic tree was achieved using the neighbour-joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. the results showed that most vaginal isolates were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. some were l. vaginalis, l. fermentum, l. mucosae, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. two isolates from a native american woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental lactobacillus species. conclusions: most women worldwide were colonized by three common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of vaginal lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial  replacement therapy.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == persistence of lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 but not l. rhamnosus gg in the human vagina as demonstrated by randomly amplified polymorphic dna.
AB  == lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14 are well-characterized probiotic strains with efficacy in the prevention and treatment of urogenital infections in women. the aim of the present study was to apply a molecular biology-based methodology for the detection of these strains and l. rhamnosus gg  (a commercially available intestinal probiotic) in the human vagina in order to assess probiotic persistence at this site. ten healthy women inserted vaginally a capsule containing either a combination of strains gr-1 and rc-14 or the gg strain for 3 consecutive nights. vaginal swabs taken before and at various time points after probiotic insertion were analyzed, and the lactobacillus flora was assessed by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. this method generated discrete dna fingerprints for gr-1, rc-14, and gg and enabled successful detection of these strains in the vagina. strain gr-1 and/or strain rc-14 was found to persist in the vaginal tract for up to 19 days after vaginal instillation, while l. rhamnosus gg was detectable for up to 5 days postadministration. in conclusion, the fates of probiotic l. rhamnosus and l. fermentum strains were successfully monitored in the human vagina by rapd analysis. this technique provides molecular biology-based evidence that rc-14 and gr-1, strains selected as urogenital probiotics, persist in the human vagina and  may be more suited to vaginal colonization than l. rhamnosus gg. this highlights  the importance of proper selection of strains for urogenital probiotic applications.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus dose required to restore and maintain a normal vaginal flora.
AB  == forty-two healthy women were randomized to receive one of three encapsulated lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 plus lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 probiotic dosage  regimens or l. rhamnosus gg by mouth each day for 28 days. however, the vaginal flora, assessed by nugent scoring, was only normal in 40% of the cases, and 14 patients had asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis. treatment with l. rhamnosus gr-1/l. fermentum rc-14 once and twice daily correlated with a healthy vaginal flora in up to 90% of patients, and 7/11 patients with bacterial vaginosis converted to normal or intermediate scores within 1 month. ingestion of l. rhamnosus gg failed to have an effect. this study confirms the potential efficacy of orally administered lactobacilli as a non-chemotherapeutic means to restore and maintain a normal urogenital flora, and shows that over 10(8) viable organisms per day is the required dose.

TI  == quality control lactobacillus strains for use with the api 50ch and api zym systems at 37 degrees c.
AB  == the api 50ch and api zym systems fulfil an important role in the polyphasic taxonomic identification of lactobacilli. when the api 50ch fermentation profile  of the quality control lactobacillus casei var. alactosus (lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) strain ncfb 206 was determined at 37 degrees c, it was found to differ from that determined at 30 degrees c by biomereiux sa (montalieu vercieu, france) and the national collection of food bacteria (aberdeen, scotland). in addition, the api 50ch fermentation and api zym profiles of lb. casei strain atcc 334t determined at 37 degrees c differed from those determined at 30 degrees c by lee  and simard (1984). strains ncfb 206 and atcc 334t were thus assumed to exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile, a phenomenon recently described by nigatu et al. (2000). in contrast, lb. rhamnosus strain atcc 243t did not exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile. moreover, the fermentation profile obtained at 37 degrees c differed in only one  respect (positive beta-gentiobiose utilisation) from that published by collins et al. (1989). in addition, lactobacillus strain gg produced a stable and reproducible api zym profile at 37 degrees c, although some variation in the level of enzyme activity was evident. thus, strain ncfb 206 was replaced by strain atcc 243t as the quality control strain of choice for use with the api 50ch fermentation system, and lactobacillus strain gg adopted for use as a quality control strain with the api zym system for strain identification of lactobacilli at 37 degrees c. the api 50ch and api zym profiles of the commercially important lactobacillus strains ncfb 1748, gg, kld, f19, and aca-dc  212.3 were determined at 37 degrees c after anaerobic growth in mrs broth. the fermentation and enzyme profiles of strain ncfb 1748 were almost identical to those of lb. crispatus atcc 33820t, those of strain gg were found to be more similar to those of lb. rhamnosus strain 243t than lb. zeae strain atcc 15820t, those of strain kld were most similar to those of lb. fermentum dsm 20052t, while those of strains f19 and aca-dc 212.3 were similar to those of lb. casei strain atcc 334t.

TI  == characterization of non-starter lactic acid bacteria from italian ewe cheeses based on phenotypic, genotypic, and cell wall protein analyses.
AB  == non-starter lactic acid bacteria (nslab) were isolated from 12 italian ewe cheeses representing six different types of cheese, which in several cases were produced by different manufacturers. a total of 400 presumptive lactobacillus isolates were obtained, and 123 isolates and 10 type strains were subjected to phenotypic, genetic, and cell wall protein characterization analyses. phenotypically, the cheese isolates included 32% lactobacillus plantarum isolates, 15% l. brevis isolates, 12% l. paracasei subsp. paracasei isolates, 9%  l. curvatus isolates, 6% l. fermentum isolates, 6% l. casei subsp. casei isolates, 5% l. pentosus isolates, 3% l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum isolates, and 1% l. rhamnosus isolates. eleven percent of the isolates were not phenotypically identified. although a randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis based on three primers and clustering by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic average (upgma) was useful for partially differentiating the 10 type strains, it did not provide a species-specific dna band or a combination of bands which permitted complete separation of all the species considered. in contrast, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis cell wall protein profiles clustered by upgma were species specific and resolved the nslab. the only exceptions were isolates phenotypically identified as l. plantarum and l. pentosus or as l. casei subsp. casei and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, which were grouped together. based on protein profiles, italian ewe cheeses frequently contained four different species and 3 to 16 strains. in general, the cheeses produced from raw ewe milk contained a larger number of more diverse strains than the cheeses produced from pasteurized  milk. the same cheese produced in different factories contained different species, as well as strains that belonged to the same species but grouped in different rapd clusters.

TI  == inhibition of uropathogenic biofilm growth on silicone rubber in human urine by lactobacilli--a teleologic approach.
AB  == the ability of three lactobacillus strains to inhibit the adhesion and growth of  naturally occurring uropathogens on silicone rubber was investigated in human urine. the importance of biosurfactant production by lactobacillus in discouraging uropathogen growth was determined in relation to the binding affinities of the lactobacilli for silicone rubber. l. fermentum b54 markedly inhibited uropathogen growth on the silicone rubber disks after 8 days for all five men included in the study, albeit to various extents ranging from 77% to 100%. in urine from women, however, this inhibition was less clear, as it was absent for two of the four women participating in this study. l. casei rhamnosus  36 completely discouraged uropathogen growth on the disks after 8 days for three  of the four women, whereas its effect in urine from men was less pronounced (inhibition ranged from 48% to 100% and was absent for one man). l. casei rhamnosus atcc 7469t was the least inhibitory lactobacillus strain tested and inhibition was absent for a number of both male and female participants, possibly as a result of the low binding affinity of this strain for silicone rubber and of its inability to release biosurfactants. we conclude that the inhibition of uropathogen growth is dependent on the lactobacillus strain involved, and for l.  fermentum b54 it was demonstrated to be sex-related. hence, inhibition must be considered a multifactorial process.

AB  == aim: the study was carried out to assess the agreement of api 50 ch fermentation  data of food lactobacilli with their rapd profiles to determine whether the system could be used alone as a reliable taxonomic tool for this genus. methods and results: api 50 ch, rapd and dna:dna reassociation data for 42 lactobacilli from tef and kocho were compared with 30 type strains. discrepancies were observed between the three methods in assigning strains of lactobacillus plantarum, lact. fermentum, weissella minor and lact. gallinarum, and lact. fermentum, lact. amylophilus, lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and lact. rhamnosus. dna reassociation data agreed well with rapd results. conclusions: api 50 ch profiles should be complemented with molecular genetic results for effective identification in lactobacillus. significance and impact of the study:  the study suggested less dependability of metabolic data alone as an identification tool.

TI  == probiotic therapy and functional foods for prevention of urinary tract infections: state of the art and science.
AB  == in the past year, interest has heightened in the potential for probiotics to prevent urinary tract infection (uti). mainly, this has been due to concerns about antibiotic resistance and recognition of the scientific efficacy of probiotics. the critical factors in any successful application of probiotics to patient care are the scientific basis for selecting probiotic strains and clinical verification that they are effective against the recurrence of uti. three strains--lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum b-54 and  rc-14--have been shown to colonize the vagina and act as a barrier to the ascension of uropathogens into the bladder. their ability to produce growth and adhesion antagonists against urogenital pathogens is clinically important, because these appear to be important mechanisms of action. probiotic therapy has  been shown to be safe, but too few reliable products are on the market, and none  are yet available for use against uti. given the right strains and delivery system, probiotic therapy could provide the first new uti-prevention system in 40 years, and may help in the management of recurrent uti.

AB  == biosurfactants produced by lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, l. rhamnosus gr-1 and 36, and l. casei shirota were found to contain proteins that bind to both collagen types iii and vi, as determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (seldi)-time of flight mass spectrometry. both collagen types iii and vi immobilized on seldi preactivated proteinchip arrays detected several different sizes (2 to 48 kda) of collagen-binding proteins. overall, the  rc-14-produced biosurfactant contained the greatest number of collagen-binding proteins (rc-14 > gr-1 > 36 > shirota), including the mature form of a previously cloned 29-kda collagen-binding protein (referred to in its mature 26-kda form). although biosurfactants isolated from l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus 36 and gr-1 also contain several collagen-binding proteins, they do not contain the 26-kda collagen-binding protein. together, these results demonstrate the utility  of the seldi system as a means of rapidly characterizing clinically important but complex biosurfactant solutions.

TI  == urea hydrogen peroxide reduces the numbers of lactobacilli, nourishes yeast, and  leaves no residues in the ethanol fermentation.
AB  == urea hydrogen peroxide (uhp) at a concentration of 30 to 32 mmol/liter reduced the numbers of five lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei, lactobacillus sp. strain 3, l. rhamnosus, and l. fermentum) from approximately 10(7) to approximately 10(2) cfu/ml in a 2-h preincubation at 30 degrees c of normal-gravity wheat mash at approximately 21 g of dissolved solids per ml containing normal levels of suspended grain particles. fermentation was completed 36 h after inoculation of saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of uhp, even when wheat mash was deliberately contaminated (infected) with l. paracasei at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml. there were no significant differences in the maximum  ethanol produced between treatments when urea hydrogen peroxide was used to kill  the bacteria and controls (in which no bacteria were added). however, the presence of l. paracasei at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml without added agent resulted in a 5.84% reduction in the maximum ethanol produced compared to the control. the bactericidal activity of uhp is greatly affected by the presence of  particulate matter. in fact, only 2 mmol of urea hydrogen peroxide per liter was  required for disinfection when mashes had little or no particulate matter present. no significant differences were observed in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in normal-gravity wheat mash at 30 degrees c whether the bactericidal agent was added as h(2)o(2) or as urea hydrogen peroxide. nadh peroxidase activity (involved in degrading h(2)o(2)) increased significantly (p = 0.05) in the presence of 0.75 mm hydrogen peroxide (sublethal level) in all five  strains of lactobacilli tested but did not persist in cells regrown in the absence of h(2)o(2). h(2)o(2)-resistant mutants were not expected or found when lethal levels of h(2)o(2) or uhp were used. contaminating lactobacilli can be effectively managed by uhp, a compound which when used at ca. 30 mmol/liter happens to provide near-optimum levels of assimilable nitrogen and oxygen that aid in vigorous fermentation performance by yeast.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == surface properties of lactobacilli isolated from healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: lactobacilli are considered cariogenic micro-organisms. as oral species of lactobacilli have not been thoroughly described, the aim of this work  was to isolated and identify these organisms from teeth, tongue, saliva and gum of healthy patients and to describe some of their surface properties. subjects: forty-four subjects from tucuman, argentina, with d, d and m, m indices equal to  0. materials and methods: samples were obtained from different areas of the oral  cavity. microorganisms were cultured in lactobacilli selected media (lbs) and identified morphologically and biochemically. hydrophobicity was analysed by partition in organic solvents, acidity by affinity with chloroform and basicity with ethyl acetate (math method), aggregation and coaggregation in presence of (nh4)2so4, and haemagglutination with abo erythrocytes in microplates. results: eighty-five lactobacilli were isolated; 29.4% were homofermenter, 44.7% facultative heterofermenter and 25.9% obligate heterofermenter. predominant species were l. fermentum, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, and l. rhamnosus. most of the strains showed moderate to high hydrophobicity and demonstrated high acid and basic surface charges with almost 40% showing salt aggregation. few strains haemagglutinated. conclusions: a variety of lactobacillus species were isolated from healthy mouths, some of whom showed adhesion-related properties such as high hydrophobicity and charged surfaces. probable mechanisms related to the ecological behaviour of lactobacilli in the oral cavity are discussed.

TI  == analysis of promoter sequences from lactobacillus and lactococcus and their activity in several lactobacillus species.
AB  == promoter-active fragments were isolated from the genome of the probiotic organism lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg using the promoter-probe vector pnz272. these promoter elements, together with a promoter fragment isolated from the vaginal strain lactobacillus fermentum br11 and two previously defined promoters (lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 slpa), were introduced into three strains of lactobacillus. primer-extension analysis was used to map the transcriptional start site for each promoter. all promoter fragments tested were functional in each of the three lactobacilli and a purine residue was used to initiate transcription in most cases. the promoter elements encompassed a 52- to 1,140-fold range in promoter activity depending on the host  strain. lactobacillus promoters were further examined by surveying previously mapped sequences for conserved base positions. the lactobacillus hexamer regions  (-35: ttgaca and -10: tataat) closely resembled those of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, with the highest degree of agreement at the -10 hexamer. the tg dinucleotide upstream of the -10 hexamer was conserved in 26% of lactobacillus promoters studied, but conservation rates differed between species. the region upstream of the -35 hexamer of lactobacillus promoters showed conservation with the bacterial up element.

AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

AB  == normal-gravity (22 to 24 degrees plato) wheat mashes were inoculated with five industrially important strains of lactobacilli at approximately 10(5), approximately 10(6), approximately 10(7), approximately 10(8), and approximately  10(9) cfu/ml in order to study the effects of the lactobacilli on yeast growth and ethanol productivity. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus #3, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus fermentum were used. controls with yeast cells but no bacterial inoculation and additional treatments  with bacteria alone inoculated at approximately 10(7) cfu/ml of mash were included. decreased ethanol yields were due to the diversion of carbohydrates for bacterial growth and the production of lactic acid. as higher numbers of the bacteria were produced (depending on the strain), 1 to 1.5% (wt/vol) lactic acid  resulted in the case of homofermentative organisms. l. fermentum, a heterofermentative organism, produced only 0.5% (wt/vol) lactic acid. when l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, and l. fermentum were inoculated at approximately 10(6)  cfu/ml, an approximately 2% decrease in the final ethanol concentration was observed. smaller initial numbers (only 10(5) cfu/ml) of l. paracasei or lactobacillus #3 were sufficient to cause more than 2% decreases in the final ethanol concentrations measured compared to the control. such effects after an inoculation of only 10(5) cfu/ml may have been due to the higher tolerance to ethanol of the latter two bacteria, to the more rapid adaptation (shorter lag phase) of these two industrial organisms to fermentation conditions, and/or to their more rapid growth and metabolism. when up to 10(9) cfu of bacteria/ml was present in mash, approximately 3.8 to 7.6% reductions in ethanol concentration occurred depending on the strain. production of lactic acid and a suspected competition with yeast cells for essential growth factors in the fermenting medium were the major reasons for reductions in yeast growth and final ethanol yield when lactic acid bacteria were present.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus supplementation with and without arginine on liver damage and bacterial translocation in an acute liver injury model in the rat.
AB  == in acute liver failure following hepatitis, toxic insults, or after major liver surgery, there is an increased bacterial translocation from the gut. this may explain some of the infectious complications seen in these conditions. to elucidate mechanisms and find possible preventive measures, we investigated the effect of rectal administration of arginine and probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus spp.) on bacterial translocation and the extent of liver failure. sprague-dawley  rats were used and five different lactobacillus strains (lb. reuteri r2lc, lb. rhamnosus dsm 6594 (= strain 271), lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (= strain 299v), lb. fermentum 8704:3 (= strain 245), and lb. reuteri (= strain 108) were administered rectally once daily for 8 days with and without 2% arginine. acute liver injury (ali) was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg body weight), and samples were collected after 24 and 48 hours. bacterial translocation was evaluated by bacterial culture from portal  and arterial blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver tissue. liver enzymes and bilirubin were evaluated in the serum. the bacterial load in the cecum and colon  was determined and the liver histopathological changes were studied. there was no mortality at any time. the liver enzymes and bilirubin decreased in some of the groups supplemented with lactobacilli with and without arginine compared with the ali control group. the incidence of bacterial translocation and the number of the translocated bacteria decreased significantly in some of the supplemented groups. lb. plantarum + arginine administration significantly reduced the level of the released liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, bacterial translocation, and the number of enterobacteriaceae in the cecum and colon. rectal administration of different lactobacillus strains with and without arginine in an ali model significantly modulates the extent of the liver failure and reduces bacterial translocation. lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (=  strain 299v) with or without arginine seemed superior to the other lactobacillus  strains. the beneficial effect of arginine administration alone indicates a possible role of nitric oxide and polyamines in this process, and the lactobacilli may execute their action via the same mechanisms or via bacterial antagonism and/or enhancement of systemic and intestinal mucosal immunity.

TI  == inhibition of initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis by biosurfactants from lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == in this study, 15 lactobacillus isolates were found to produce biosurfactants in  the mid-exponential and stationary growth phases. the stationary-phase biosurfactants from lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469, lactobacillus fermentum b54, and lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 were investigated further to determine their capacity to inhibit the initial adhesion of uropathogenic enterococcus faecalis 1131 to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rate of e. faecalis to glass with an adsorbed biosurfactant layer from l. acidophilus rc14 or l. fermentum b54 was significantly decreased by approximately 70%, while the number of adhering enterococci after 4 h of adhesion was reduced by an average of 77%. the surface activity of the biosurfactants and their activity inhibiting the initial adhesion of e. faecalis 1131 were retained after dialysis (molecular weight cutoff, 6,000  to 8,000) and freeze-drying. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the freeze-dried biosurfactants from l.  acidophilus rc14 and l. fermentum b54 were richest in protein, while those from l. casei subsp. rhamnosus 36 and atcc 7469 had relatively high polysaccharide and phosphate contents.

TI  == comparison of proteolytic activities in various lactobacilli.
AB  == a total of 169 lactobacillus strains from 12 species (lb. acidophilus, lb. brevis, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, lb. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lb. fermentum, lb. helveticus, lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. plantarum and lb. rhamnosus), isolated from raw milk and various milk products, and 9 lactococcus lactis strains were evaluated for peptidase activities with five chromogenic substrates  and a tryptic digest of casein. within each species, the peptidase activity of the cell-free extracts of the strains varied. furthermore, differences were observed between the lactobacillus species and lc. lactis. lb. helveticus had by  far the highest hydrolysing activities towards all substrates, indicating the presence of powerful aminopeptidases, x-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidases and proline iminopeptidases. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus possessed high hydrolysing activities towards substrates containing proline, alanyl-prolyl-p-nitroanilide and prolyl-p-nitroanilide. on the other hand, lb. fermentum and lb. brevis could be considered as weakly proteolytic species. a more detailed study with highly proteolytic lactobacillus strains indicated that  at least three different proteinases or endopeptidases were present. compared with lc. lactis, the lactobacillus strains had a much lower hydrolytic action on  glutamyl-glutamic acid, suggesting that glutamyl aminopeptidase was absent in lactobacilli.

TI  == enzyme production by lactobacilli and the potential link with infective endocarditis.
AB  == fifty-six strains of lactobacilli were examined for the production of glycosidases and proteases (arylamidases) that could be associated with the ability to grow in vivo and/or be a factor in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. the strains were from seven species, with an emphasis on lactobacillus rhamnosus  and lact. paracasei subsp. paracasei, both of which have been associated with endocarditis and provided 12 of the 13 strains isolated from cases of the disease. other species were lact. acidophilus, lact. plantarum, lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. commonly expressed glycosidase activities were alpha-d-galactosidase and beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase followed by beta-d-glucosidase and alpha-l-fucosidase. the combined production of beta-n-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and alpha-d-galactosidase was a feature of the endocarditis isolates. in contrast, beta-d-galactosidase was produced by very few of the strains within species implicated in endocarditis but most of the strains  of lact. salivarius, lact. fermentum and lact. oris. the most commonly produced arylamidases active against substrates employed for testing human blood clotting  cascade were activated protein c(ca)-like, activated factor x(xa)-like and hageman factor-like followed by kallikrein-like and chymotrypsin-like enzymes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == pathogenic potential of lactobacilli.
AB  == lactobacilli are often considered to be commensal or beneficial participants in human microbial ecology and considerable research is being carried out into the effects of the use of lactobacilli as additives in both human and animal diets. however, lactobacilli also cause some human diseases (e.g. dental caries, rheumatic vascular disease, septicaemia and infective endocarditis (ie)), and have recently been identified as potential emerging pathogens in elderly and immunocompromised patients, particularly those receiving broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. the identification of potential pathogenic traits amongst lactobacilli will therefore facilitate the use of the organisms for probiotic purposes. the ability to aggregate human platelets is considered to be a possible pathogenic trait in the progression of ie. a comparison of bacterial cell surface properties amongst l. rhamnosus strains showed that platelets were aggregated by  5/5 ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. however two strains, morphological mutants of a non-aggregating strain, which had been re-isolated after passaging through rats were found to aggregate platelets. no loss of aggregating function occurred on extensive subculturing of ie strains. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains for five other species, namely, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salvivarius, with each species being represented indicating that the property is not uncommon in the genus. a comparison of ie and oral isolates of l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei subsp. paracasei and seven other lactobacillus species, has shown that the binding of both fibronectin and fibrinogen by lactobacilli is greatly increased, up to 50 fold, when the ph is reduced from 7.0 to 5.0. re-exposing the lactobacilli to a neutral ph environment releases most of the bound proteins, but the amount still  remaining bound to the cell is several times more than is bound at neutral ph. lactobacilli will also bind to the proteins that make up the extracellular matrix of endothelial cells. lactobacilli bound significantly better to collagen types i and v than to types iii and iv (p < 0.01). further, strains isolated from ie cases, particularly l. rhamnosus strains, bound significantly better to types i and v than did 'normal' strains (p < 0.02). type v collagen has been demonstrated at the sites of endothelial damage. thus the binding of lactobacilli, particularly l. rhamnosus to these collagen types may be of importance in the early stages of colonization of the damaged heart valve.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the aggregation of human platelets by lactobacillus species.
AB  == the ability to aggregate human platelets was examined for five lactobacillus rhamnosus strains and five lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei strains isolated from patients with infective endocarditis (ie), 25 laboratory isolates from the same two species, and 14 strains from five other oral species, namely lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus salivarius. amongst the l. rhamnosus strains, platelets were aggregated by all five ie strains and 8/16 laboratory strains. for the l. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains, the respective numbers were 2/5 and 2/9. aggregation also occurred with 11/14 strains of the other five  species; each species was represented. the optimal ratio of bacteria to platelets for aggregation was approximately 1:1, and there was considerable variation in the lag phase that preceded aggregation, depending on the source of the platelets. overall, the lag phase varied between 0.25 +/- 0.1 and 20.4 +/- 3.2 min and the percentage aggregation ranged between 70 +/- 2.6 and 104 +/- 13.5%. confirmation that aggregation was being observed came from studies with five strains on the inhibitory effects of edta, dipyridamole, apyrase, imipramine, acetylsalicylic acid and quinacrine. inhibition of aggregation by l. rhamnosus strains by the peptide arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine (rgds) further indicated a role for fibronectin and/or fibrinogen. pronase treatment of cells for 1 h and extraction of bacterial surface components with 0.1 m-tris/hcl (ph 8.5) at 37 degrees c for 1 h stopped aggregation in 8/9 ie strains. extracted surface proteins (200 micrograms) completely inhibited platelet aggregation by 8/9 of the homologous strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nucleic acids of species of lactobacillus.
AB  == nucleic acid composition of 17 cultures representing the type or neotype strains  of 15 named lactobacillus species was studied. nucleic acid characterization of these isolates was accompanied by a comparative study of conventional phenotypic  reactions. the overall guanine plus cytosine mean deoxyribonucleic acid base composition ranged from 33 to 50% and genome sizes varied between 700 and 1500 x  10(6) daltons. sporolactobacillus inulinus contained 2500 x 10(6) daltons of chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid and was therefore similar in size to members of the genus bacillus. deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization at a temperature 15 degrees c below the thermal melting temperature confirmed the extreme molecular heterogeneity of many species. the genus can be divided into three major groups,  each containing four or more species based on a combination of nucleic acid characteristics and conventional phenotypic reactions. group i (33 to 39% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus helveticus nov. ssp. jugurt, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus sanfrancisco. group ii (42 to 48% guanine plus cytosine contains lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus,  lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus brevis, and group iii (48 to 50% guanine plus cytosine) contains lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii nov. ssp. leichmanii, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus fermentum nov. ssp. cellobiosis.
