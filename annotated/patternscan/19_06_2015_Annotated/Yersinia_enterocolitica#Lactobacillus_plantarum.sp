TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of healthy infants against enteropathogenic bacteria.
AB  == lactobacilli are normal microflora of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract and are a heterogeneous group of lactic acid bacteria (lab). lactobacillus strains with probiotic activity may have health benefits for human. this study investigates the probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains obtained from the feces of healthy infants and also explores antibacterial activity of lactobacillus strains with probiotic potential against enteropathogenic bacteria. fecal samples were collected from 95 healthy infants younger than 18 months. two hundred and ninety  lactobacillus strains were isolated and assessed for probiotic potential properties including ability to survive in gastrointestinal conditions (ph 2.0, 0.3% oxgall), adherence to ht-29 cells and antibiotic resistance. six strains including lactobacillusfermentum (4 strains), lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum showed good probiotic potential and inhibited the growth  of enteropathogenic bacteria including etec h10407, shigella flexneri atcc 12022, shigella sonnei atcc 9290, salmonella enteritidis h7 and yersinia enterocolitica  atcc 23715. these lactobacillus strains with probiotic potential may be useful for prevention or treatment of diarrhea, but further in vitro and in vivo studies on these strains are still required.

TI  == evaluation and functional characterization of a biosurfactant produced by lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194.
AB  == the study details the investigations on the ability of lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194, an isolate from kanjika, a rice-based ayurvedic fermented product, to produce biosurfactant. surfactant production, as a function of fermentation time, indicates that the maximum production occurred at 72 h under stationary conditions. isolation, partial purification, and characterization of the biosurfactant produced have been carried out, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) spectra demonstrated that biosurfactants were constituted by  protein and polysaccharide fractions, i.e., possessed the structure typical of glycoprotein, which is affected by the medium composition and the phase of growth of the biosurfactant-synthesizing strain. critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the biosurfactant was found to be 6 g l(-1). the emulsification index (ei), emulsification activity (ea), and emulsion stability (es) values of the biosurfactant have confirmed its emulsification property. aqueous fractions of the produced biosurfactant exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogenic species: escherichia coli atcc 31705, e. coli mtcc 108, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859, and staphylococcus aureus f 722. more importantly, the biosurfactant from l. plantarum showed antiadhesive property against above food-borne pathogens. the results thus indicate the potential for developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of food contact surfaces and health-care prosthesis using these biosurfactants.

TI  == lack of correlation between in vitro antibiosis and in vivo protection against enteropathogenic bacteria by probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == increased resistance to infection is one of the beneficial effects attributed to  probiotic microorganisms. this effect may be due to several mechanisms: production of inhibitory substances, blocking of adhesion sites on the intestinal surface, competition for nutrients and stimulation of mucosal and systemic immunity. the present study aimed to investigate the correlation between in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of probiotic lactobacilli. the agar spot test  was used to show that twenty lactobacillus strains were able to inhibit the enteropathogenic bacterium yersinia enterocolitica. this inhibition was mainly attributable to a decrease in ph resulting from dextrose fermentation by lactobacilli. the inhibition of y. enterocolitica, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes by two probiotic strains, lactobacillus casei c1 and lactobacillus plantarum c4, was also associated with the ph decrease. however, both strains lacked protective effects in mouse experimental infection models, with the exception of long-lasting pre-treatment with l. plantarum c4, which exerted a partial protective effect against s. typhimurium that was attributable to an immunostimulatory mechanism. our results show that in vitro antibiosis tests do not provide useful information on the probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains.

TI  == isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic  and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == a finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: salmonella typhimurium ef 85-9, escherichia coli o157:h7 atcc 43888, enterococcus faecalis jcm 8726, staphylococcus aureus jcm 2151, and yersinia enterocolitica jcm 7577. at the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and microtiter plate growth assay. six bacterial  strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of  the tested indicator strains. four strains (m1-m4) belonged to shigella species and the other two strains (m5 and m6) belonged to salmonella species. the antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. the antimicrobial substances from m3, m4 and m6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees c with 100% relative activity. the bacteriocin-like substance  produced by strain m2 was partially characterized. it exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except enterobacter aerogenes jcm 1235 and lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum jcm  1149. it was stable at a wide range of ph (3-11). there was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees c or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees c. this is the first report indicating the presence  of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.

TI  == antagonistic activity of potential probiotic lactobacilli against the ureolytic pathogen yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus spp., isolated from sourdough and olive brines (seven strains), and three human isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity  in coculture against the ureolytic pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. a general reduction in the pathogen population was observed after 6 h when each lactobacillus strain was cocultured with the pathogen at a ratio of 100:1 cfu ml(-1), causing an almost complete inhibition of urease activity. strains were also screened for their performances in in vitro tests such as adhesion ability to caco-2 cells, tolerance to low ph, bile salts, and simulated digestion, which  enabled the differences between strains to be highlighted. three strains, l. paracasei impc2.1 and l. plantarum itm21b and itm5bg, met the main criteria for selecting effective probiotics: the ability to inhibit the pathogen y. enterocolitica and, consequently, its urease activity (itm21b); survival of simulated digestion (itm21b and impc2.1); strong adhesion ability to enterocytes  and good survival at low ph and in the presence of bile salts (itm5bg and impc2.1).

TI  == bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, listeria innocua and leuconostoc  dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas fluorescens  and two strains of escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 mpa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 mpa) was compared in this study. within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative  bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. all gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. further it appears that the mutant e. coli lmm1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure  homogenisation than its parental strain mg1655. the preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation  of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus cell population by using low ph (5.5 7), nacl  (0 6%) or sds (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from plants against selected pathogenic  and saprophytic microorganisms.
AB  == the beneficial health effects of extracts from many types of plants that are used as seasoning agents in foods and beverages have been claimed for centuries. the purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of selected herb and spice essential oils for control of growth and survival of microorganisms. inhibition of growth was tested by the paper disc agar diffusion method. antibiotic susceptibility discs were used as control. minimum lethal concentration (mlc) was determined by the tube dilution method. essential oils from anise, angelica, basil, carrot, celery, cardamom, coriander, dill weed, fennel, oregano, parsley,  and rosemary were evaluated. inhibition ranged from complete with oregano to no inhibition with carrot oil for each of the test strains that included: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o:157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lactobacillus plantarum, aspergillus niger, geotrichum, and rhodotorula. oregano essential oil showed the greatest inhibition (zone, > or = 70 to 80 mm) (mlc, approximately 8 ppm). coriander and basil were also highly inhibitory (mlc, approximately 25 to 50 ppm) to e. coli o:157:h7 and to the other bacteria and fungi tested. anise oil was not particularly inhibitory to bacteria (inhibition zone, approximately 25 mm); however, anise oil was highly inhibitory to molds. because some of the herbal and spice essential oils are highly inhibitory to selected pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, they may provide alternatives and supplements to conventional antimicrobial additives in foods.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == antagonistic activity of two strains of lactic acid bacteria against listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica in a model fish product at 5 degrees c.
AB  == the antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria against one strain of listeria  monocytogenes, scott a and one strain of yersinia enterocolitica serotype o:3 was studied by using either a strain of a leuconostoc spp. or a lactobacillus plantarum strain. each of the two potential pathogenic, psychrotrophic bacteria were inoculated with either of the two lactic acid bacteria in sterile shrimp extracts containing citric acid (ph 5.8 and 6.0) and in some experiments also 3%  (w/v) nacl. the samples were incubated at 5 degrees c. antagonistic effect was obtained with both lactic acid bacteria against both pathogenic organisms, with the effect depending on inoculation levels of the pathogenic organism, the lactic acid bacteria strain and media composition.

TI  == microculture model studies on the effect of various gas atmospheres on microbial  growth at different temperatures.
AB  == a microculture technique, employing 96-well tissue culture plates in plastic bags, was used to test the effect of different gas atmospheres (vacuum, air, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide) on the growth of escherichia coli, bacillus macerans, salmonella typhimurium. candida albicans, lactobacillus plantarum, pseudomonas/acinetobacter/moraxella-group, brochothrix thermosphacta and yersinia enterocolitica at 2, 6, and 20 degrees c. in general, carbon dioxide was the most effective inhibitor. the inhibition increased with decreasing temperature. only the combination of carbon dioxide and 2 degrees c provided complete inhibition of broch. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica.
