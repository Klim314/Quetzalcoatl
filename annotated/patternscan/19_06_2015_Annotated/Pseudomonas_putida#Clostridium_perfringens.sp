TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == [study of the microbial multiplication in the muscle just after slaughter (author's transl)].
AB  == the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the serum, the muscle and the rabbit meat juice was followed after slaughter on animals vaccinated or not against e. coli, p. putida, cl. perfringens. rabbit serum is bactericidal against gram negative bacteria, p. putida and e. coli. on the contrary it is without effect on cl. perfringens. muscle has no inhibitory effect against e. coli and cl. perfringens on animals vaccinated or not. p. putida is inhibited or partially eliminated from rabbit muscle just after slaughter. vaccination does not increase the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activities of the sera, the meat juices and intact muscles.
