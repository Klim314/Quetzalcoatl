TI  == bacteria trigger oxygen radical release and sperm lipid peroxidation in in vitro  model of semen inflammation.
AB  == objective: to assess the in vitro effect of five bacterial strains isolated from  semen samples (escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus oralis, bacteroides ureolyticus, and ureaplasma urealyticum) on reactive oxygen intermediate (roi) release and lipid sperm membrane peroxidation in the coincubated suspensions of white blood cells (wbc) with spermatozoa. design: an in vitro model of semen infection. setting: basic research laboratory. patient(s): healthy normozoospermic volunteers and healthy blood donors. intervention(s): none. main outcome measure(s): chemiluminescent assay was used to evaluate roi generation by wbc. malondialdehyde (mda) concentration was determined in sperm lysates using high-performance liquid chromatography. result(s): of the bacterial strains tested, b. ureolyticus, s. haemolyticus, and  e. coli caused the greatest damage to sperm membrane lipids. an increase in mda levels in sperm lysates was a natural consequence of bacteria-induced roi generation. the wbc usually enhanced harmful activity of the infectious agent toward the cell membranes. conclusion(s): the harmful effect of bacteria on spermatozoa depends on the type and species of microorganisms invading, colonizing, or infecting the male genital tract and is associated with the accompanying oxidative stress. the presence of leukocytes in semen appears to be  the additional factor enhancing the sperm lipid membrane peroxidation, which may  affect the fertility status.

TI  == nonspecific aerobic vaginitis and pregnancy.
AB  == during the period 1996-1998, cervical swabs of 50 pregnant women with subacute amniotic infection syndrome (ais) and the semen of their consorts were bacteriologically analyzed. in the control group were 50 healthy pregnant women and their consorts too. pathogenic bacteria (the most common were escherichia coli, staphylococcus haemolyticus, chlamydia trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum) were isolated from the cervical swab of 50 pregnant patients with ais in 86.0% of them, while in the control group of healthy pregnant women in 28.0%. pathogenic bacteria were present in 70.0% of semen of consorts pregnant women with ais and only in 30.0% of semen of the control group. the congruity of  pathogenic bacteria in the cervical swab and semen in the investigated group was  69.2%, while only 35.7% in the control group. following erythromycin, cefuroxime  and local tetracyclin treatment, the negativization of the cervical swab resulted in 30 pregnant patients with ais, while the colonization persisted in 20 of them. the outcome of pregnancy was significantly better in cases with negativization of the cervical swab: perinatal loss was 6.7%, while in cases with persistent infection it was 55.0%. the authors presume the amniotic infection syndrome should be ascending manifestation of nonspecific vaginitis, which is maintained by the consort's urogenital infection. ais should be classified as a 'sexually-transmitted disease'.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == [microbial associations in trichomonas urethritis].
AB  == the results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from trichomonas urethritis are given. microorganisms belonged to the species: mycoplasma hominis. ureaplasma urealyticum. streptococcus pyogenes. escherichia coli. klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus mirabilis. moraxella lacunata. acinetobacter calcoaceticus and candida. staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100%  patients belonged to 8 species: staphylococcus aureus, s. intermedius, s. haemolyticus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis, s. hominis, s. warneri, s. saprophyticus. most of staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. structure of trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
