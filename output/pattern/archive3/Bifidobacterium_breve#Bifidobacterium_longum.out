bifidobacteria exert strain-specific effects on stress-related behavior and physiology in balb/c mice.
background: accumulating evidence suggests that commensal bacteria consumption has the potential to have a positive impact on stress-related psychiatric disorders. however, the specific bacteria influencing behaviors related to anxiety and depression remain unclear. to this end, we compared the effects of two different bifidobacteria on anxiety and depression-like behavior; an antidepressant was also used as a comparator. methods: innately anxious balb/c mice received daily bifidobacterium longum (b.) 1714, b. breve 1205, the antidepressant escitalopram or vehicle treatment for 6 weeks. behavior was assessed in stress-induced hyperthermia test, marble burying, elevated plus maze, open field, tail suspension test, and forced swim test. physiological responses to acute stress were also assessed. key results: both bifidobacteria and escitalopram reduced anxiety in the marble burying test; however, only b. longum 1714 decreased stress-induced hyperthermia. b. breve 1205 induced lower anxiety in the elevated plus maze whereas b. longum 1714 induced antidepressant-like behavior in the tail suspension test. however, there was no difference in corticosterone levels between groups. conclusions & inferences: these data show that these two bifidobacteria strains reduced anxiety in an anxious mouse strain. these results also suggest that each bacterial strain has intrinsic effects and may be beneficially specific for a given disorder. these findings strengthen the role of gut microbiota supplementation as psychobiotic-based strategies for stress-related brain-gut axis disorders, opening new avenues in the field of neurogastroenterology.
interactions between bifidobacterium and bacteroides species in cofermentations are affected by carbon sources, including exopolysaccharides produced by bifidobacteria.
cocultures of strains from two bifidobacterium and two bacteroides species were performed with exopolysaccharides (eps) previously purified from bifidobacteria, with inulin, or with glucose as the carbon source. bifidobacterium longum nb667 and bifidobacterium breve ipla20004 grew in glucose but showed poor or no growth in complex carbohydrates (inulin, eps e44, and eps r1), whereas bacteroides grew well in the four carbon sources tested. in the presence of glucose, the growth of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron dsm-2079 was inhibited by b. breve, whereas it remained unaffected in the presence of b. longum. ba. fragilis dsm-2151 contributed to a greater survival of b. longum, promoting changes in the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) and organic acids in coculture with respect to monocultures. in complex carbohydrates, cocultures of bifidobacterium strains with ba. thetaiotaomicron did not modify the behavior of bacteroides nor improve the poor growth of bifidobacteria. the metabolic activity of ba. fragilis in coculture with bifidobacteria was not affected by eps, but greater survival of bifidobacteria at late stages of incubation occurred in cocultures than in monocultures, leading to a higher production of acetic acid than in monocultures. therefore, cocultures of bifidobacterium and bacteroides can behave differently against fermentable carbohydrates as a function of the specific characteristics of the strains from each species. these results stress the importance of considering specific species and strain interactions and not simply higher taxonomic divisions in the relationship among intestinal microbial populations and their different responses to probiotics and prebiotics.
in vitro evaluation of bifidobacterium strains of human origin for potential use  in probiotic functional foods.
the present study investigated some in vitro properties for probiotic use of four strains of bifidobacteria isolated from faeces of healthy children (bifidobacterium longum 51a, bifidobacterium breve 1101a, bifidobacterium pseudolongum 1191a and bifidobacterium bifidum 1622a). in vitro tests were carried out to compare growth rate, aerotolerance, antagonistic activity against pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility profile and cell wall hydrophobicity. mean doubling time of b. longum 51a was shorter compared to the other strains. all strains were aerotolerant up to 72 h of exposure to oxygen. in vitro antagonism showed that b. longum 51a and b. pseudolongum 1191a were able to produce inhibitory diffusible compounds against all pathogenic bacteria tested, but not against candida albicans. b. longum 51a was sensitive to all the antimicrobials tested, except neomycin. the hydrophobic property of the cell wall was highest for b. bifidum 1622a. based on these parameters, b. longum 51a showed the best potential for probiotic use among the tested strains, presenting the greatest sensitivity to antimicrobials, the best growth rate and the highest capacity to produce antagonistic substances against various pathogenic microorganisms.
lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria attenuate the proinflammatory response in intestinal epithelial cells induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to disease progression. various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory responses. one factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8, cxcl-8), is one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. the purpose of this study was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104 in the presence of selected probiotics and lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm animals. il-8 gene expression and protein production in ht-29 cells were evaluated by real-time pcr and elisa, respectively. pre-incubation of ht-29 cells with lactobacillus kefir im002, bifidobacterium adolescentis frp 61, bifidobacterium longum frp 68 and frp 69, bifidobacterium breve frp 334, and leuconostoc mesenteroides im080 significantly inhibited il-8 secretion induced by salmonella typhimurium dt104. co-culture of selected probiotics and salmonella typhimurium dt104 reduced il-8 production, while potential probiotics and lab had no effect on il-8 secretion in ht-29 cells preincubated with salmonella typhimurium dt104 prior to adding probiotics. lactobacillus kefir im002 supernatant also significantly reduced il-8 production. in conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic bifidobacteria and lab modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.
prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides preference of probiotic bifidobacteria  and antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile.
bifidobacterium breve 46, bifidobacterium lactis 8:8 and bifidobacterium longum 6:18 and three reference strains b. breve ccug 24611, b. lactis jcm 10602, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum jcm 1200 were examined for acid and bile tolerance, prebiotic utilization and antimicrobial activity against four clostridium difficile (cd) strains including the hypervirulent strain, pcr ribotype nap1/027. b. lactis 8:8 and b. lactis jcm 10602 exhibited a high tolerance in mrsc broth with ph 2.5 for 30 min. b. breve 46 and b. lactis 8:8 remained 100% viable in mrsc broth with 5% porcine bile after 4 h. all six strains showed a high prebiotic degrading ability (prebiotic score) with galactooligosaccharides (gos), isomaltooligosaccharides (imos) and lactulose as carbon sources and moderate degradation of fructooligosaccharides (fos). xylooligosaccharides (xos) was metabolized to a greater extent by b. lactis 8:8, b. lactis jcm 10602, b. pseudocatenulatum jcm 1200 and b. longum 6:18 (prebiotic score >50%). all strains exhibited extracellular antimicrobial activity (ama) against four cd strains including the cd nap1/027. ama of b. breve 46, b. lactis 8:8 and b. lactis jcm 10602 strains was mainly ascribed to a combined action of organic acids and heat stable, protease sensitive antimicrobial peptides when cells were grown in mrsc broth with glucose and by acids when grown with five different prebiotic-non-digestible oligosaccharides (ndos). none of c. difficile strains degraded five prebiotic-ndos. whole cells of b. breve 46 and b. lactis 8:8 and their supernatants inhibited the growth and toxin production of the cd nap1/027 strain.
immunostimulatory effect of faecal bifidobacterium species of breast-fed and formula-fed infants in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell/caco-2 co-culture system.
bifidobacterium spp. typical of the human intestinal microbiota are believed to influence the balance of immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different bifidobacterial species and their mixtures in in vitro experiments with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and caco-2 cells. bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. infantis, b. longum and two combinations of these bifidobacteria simulating the species composition found in faecal samples from breast-fed (bf) and formula-fed (ff) infants were used. the levels of several cytokines were measured by direct stimulation of pbmc and by stimulation of a caco-2/pbmc co-culture with bifidobacteria. b. catenulatum and b. breve were the strongest enhancers of interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) production by direct stimulation of pbmc. b. longum was the highest inducer of il-10 and the lowest tnf-alpha stimulus. in the caco-2/pbmc system, b. breve was the highest inducer of il-8 production by caco-2 cells, significantly different from b. infantis, b. adolescentis and the ff mixture (p < 0.05). ifn-gamma produced by pbmc stimulated with the bf mixture (containing 22 % b. breve, compared with 7 % in the ff mixture) was significantly higher compared with b. adolescentis, b. infantis and b. longum. b. adolescentis also inhibited ifn-gamma production compared with the ff mixture and b. longum. the proportion of different bifidobacterium strains seems to be an important determinant of the cytokine balance in the simulated intestinal environment studied. b. breve and the combination of the bifidobacterium species typically found in the microbiota of bf infants have shown the most significant effects.
chemical characterization of tomato juice fermented with bifidobacteria.
the objective of this research was to characterize the chemical properties of tomato juice fermented with bifidobacterial species. tomato juice was prepared from fresh tomatoes and heated at 100 degrees c prior to fermentation. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium infantis were inoculated in tomato juice and kept at 35 to 37 degrees c for up to 6 h. fructooligosaccharide (fos) was added to tomato juice prior to fermentation. the analyses for brix, total titratable acidity (tta), ph, color, and lycopene content were conducted to characterize tomato juices fermented with bifidobacterial species. heat treatment of tomato juice did not cause any significant changes in brix, ph, and tta. only the redness of tomato juice was significantly increased, as the heating time increased to 30 min. the tomato juices fermented with b. breve and b. longum exhibited significant decreases in ph (3.51 and 3.80, respectively) and significant increases in tta (13.50 and 12.50, respectively) (p < 0.05). b. infantis did not cause any significant change in the chemical properties of tomato juice. the addition of fos further improved the fermentation of tomato juice by bifidobacterial species. the lycopene contents of tomato juice were significantly increased from 88 to 113 microg/g by heat treatment at 100 degrees c (p < 0.05), however did not exhibit any significant change after fermentation with bifidobacterial species.
interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be influenced by the individual's microbiota.
anti-inflammatory effects of the genus bifidobacterium on macrophages by modification of phospho-i kappab and socs gene expression.
although beneficial roles of probiotics for inflammatory bowel diseases have been reported, their direct action on immune cells has not been elucidated. in this study, we investigated how three species of bifidobacterium and enterococcus faecalis differentially modulate production of cytokines from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated macrophages in vitro using raw264.7 cells. the mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased after exposure to lps, e. faecalis alone and lps combined with e. faecalis. in contrast, il-10 mrna levels were significantly decreased after exposure to e. faecalis compared with exposure to bifidobacterium species. when cells were exposed to bifidobacterium species combined with lps, mrna levels of il12p40 were decreased by co-culture with b. breve and b. longum, il-1 beta mrna levels were decreased by b. breve and b. adorescentis and tnf-alpha mrna levels were decreased by b. adolescentis compared with lps alone. the three species of bifidobacterium significantly inhibited phosphorylation of i kappab-alpha induced by lps. the mrna levels of socs1 and socs3 were increased by exposure to lps alone; however, the mrna levels of socs1 or socs3 were increased more by exposure to bifidobacterium species combined with lps. conversely, e. faecalis combined with lps induced significantly lower levels of socs mrna than those induced by bifidobacterium species combined with lps. these results indicated that certain species of genus bifidobacterium could negatively modulate mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines produced from lps-stimulated raw264.7 cells, which is possibly related to inhibition of i kappab-alpha phosphorylation and stimulation of socs signalling.
oral administration of bifidobacterium longum prevents gut-derived pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis in mice.
aims: the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics on gut-derived sepsis caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa in immunocompromised mice. methods and results: after oral inoculation of p. aeruginosa, mice were treated with cyclophosphamide to induce leucopenia and translocation of the intestinal p. aeruginosa into blood, thereby producing gut-derived sepsis. in this model, administration of 1 x 10(9) cfu of bifidobacterium longum strain bb536 for 10 days significantly (p < 0.01) increased the survival rate compared with groups of mice administered either with bifidobacterium breve strain atcc 15700 or excipients contained in the probiotic bacterial powder. administration of b. longum significantly decreased viable counts of p. aeruginosa in the liver and blood compared with other groups. culture of intestinal contents revealed a significantly lower viable count of p. aeruginosa in the jejunum of b. longum-treated mice compared with other groups of mice. furthermore, in vitro data demonstrated that b. longum possessed apparently higher adherent activity to caco-2 cell monolayers and significantly suppressed the adherence of p. aeruginosa to the monolayers of cells compared with other groups. conclusion: oral administration of b. longum protects mice against gut-derived sepsis caused by p. aeruginosa, and the effect may be due to interference of p. aeruginosa adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. significance and impact of this study: this study demonstrated that oral administration of b. longum bb536 is effective to protect against opportunistic infection with drug-resistant bacteria such as p. aeruginosa. the results suggest that probiotics may play an important role even in the immunocompromised patients.
establishment and follow-up of bifidobacterial species in the gut of healthy bottle-fed infants of 1-4 months age.
twenty-one healthy bottle-fed infants were screened monthly (1-4 months) for bifidobacteria in their stools. bifidobacteria were detected by culture and isolates specified by pcr. alternatively, direct pcr in undiluted fecal suspensions was carried out for detection of bifidobacteria under the cultural detection level. all infants harbored cultivable bifidobacteria throughout the study period. beerens medium was shown to permit a better recovery of bifidobacteria than mrs and horse blood columbia agar. direct pcr detection proved valuable in detecting species for which no cultural isolate could be recovered since the species were under the cultural detection level. b. bifidum, b. longum-infantis and b. breve were confirmed as dominant and stable species in infant stools while b. adolescentis and b. catenulatum group exhibited unstable colonization profiles. a trend towards b. breve decrease began at month 3 while carriage of the b. catenulatum group and b. adolescentis was rising. this observation warrants further analysis to assess a possible switch occurring at month 3 in bottle-fed infants, between so-called infant and adult bifidobacterial species.
antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2 to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on a more limited number of strains.
cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
[the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b. longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.
[the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.
