antimicrobial efficacy of denture adhesives on some oral malodor-related microbes.
the objective of the study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of three denture adhesives toward streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum. adhesives used were corega ultra((r)), fixodent pro original((r)) and biotene((r)) denture grip. for streptococcus oralis and streptococcus mutans, four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml and 1 g denture of adhesive were used. in addition four tubes of trypticase soy broth 10 ml without any denture adhesive was employed as control. for prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum, four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml and 1 g denture adhesive were used for each one, while four tubes of thioglycolate 10 ml without adhesive served as control. all samples were incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees c. after 48 h, the number of colonies was counted and the mean was extracted as cfu/ml. the results were evaluated with anova on ranked data and tukey's post hoc test at alpha = 0.05. streptococcus oralis, mutans, prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum showed decreased number of colonies for each denture adhesive compared to the control. under the conditions of this in vitro study, all the tested denture adhesives showed antimicrobial efficacy. however, in contrast to the hypothesis, there were differences among them. corega ultra((r)) and biotene((r)) denture grip were more effective for all the tested oral malodor-related microbes than fixodent pro original((r)).
characterization of a novel n-acetylneuraminic acid-specific fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 adhesin.
fusobacterium nucleatum has been identified as significantly associated with sites with active periodontal disease and, as a group, the oral fusobacteria coaggregate with members of all oral bacteria genera tested. monoclonal antibodies were prepared and used in conjunction with other potential inhibitors, such as simple sugars and amino acids, to characterize coaggregation interactions, of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique monoclonal antibodies, 5h11, 14c7, 19f2 and 29c12, were obtained by their ability to inhibit coaggregation of f. nucleatum pk1594 with actinomyces israelii pk16. they were also capable of inhibiting other coaggregations including streptococcus oralis h1, s. oralis j22, capnocytophaga ochracea atcc33596, prevotella denticola pk1277 and prevotella intermedia pk1511. all of these interactions were completely inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid. neither n-acetylneuraminic acid nor monoclonal antibody 5h11 had any inhibitory effect on other f. nucleatum pk1594 interactions, including all galactose-inhibitable coaggregations. the results indicate that f. nucleatum pk1594 expresses upon its surface a distinct type of adhesin that mediates coaggregation interactions that are inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid.
comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.
