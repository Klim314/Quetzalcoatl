TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of propolis and other substances against selected endodontic pathogens.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ethanol extract of propolis (eep) and intracanal medicaments calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol by means of the macrodilution method using the reinforced clostridial medium (rcm) and brucella and brain heart infusion media. study design: the antimicrobial agents were sequentially diluted  and tested against anaerobic bacteria prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, and clostridium perfringens and against enterococcus faecalis, with the 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml standardized inocula. the tubes  were anaerobically incubated and the minimum inhibitory concentration was detected. blood agar rcm subcultures were performed to provide minimum bactericidal concentration. the results were analyzed by analysis of variance test. results: all drugs were effective against all tested strains, without statistical differences. e. faecalis was the less susceptible strain, and rcm broth promoted faster bacterial growth, but there were no significant differences in these results. ethanol did not influence the antimicrobial effect of eep.

TI  == activity of endodontic antibacterial agents against selected anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of substances used as antibacterial agents (solutions  of 10% calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol - pmcc, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate and 10% castor oil plant detergent) on anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, prevotella nigrescens atcc 33563, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124 and bacteroidesfragilis atcc 25285), using a broth dilution technique, was evaluated in vitro. for determination of minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericide concentrations (mic and mbc), two culture broths, reinforced clostridial medium (rcm) and supplemented brucella, standardized inoculum and serially diluted solutions were used. all antibacterial agents presented antimicrobial activity that varied for different bacteria. there were no differences in the performance of the two broths. chlorhexidine digluconate was the most effective, with the lowest mics, followed by castor oil  detergent, pmcc and calcium hydroxide. c. perfringens and b. fragilis were the most resistant bacteria to all agents.

TI  == in vitro effect of intracanal medicaments on strict anaerobes by means of the broth dilution method.
AB  == the determination of bacterial susceptibility to intracanal medicaments is a necessity. nevertheless, few studies utilize the proper methodology to carry out  that evaluation with anaerobes. in this study, the steps of a broth dilution method, carried out in microplates (microdilution) and tubes (macrodilution), to  test the effect of traditional intracanal medicaments on anaerobic bacteria are described. the results are presented as values of minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (mic and mbc). standardized inocula of the anaerobic  bacteria prevotella nigrescens (atcc 33563), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 25586) and clostridium perfringens (atcc 13124), in reinforced clostridium medium (rcm)  and supplemented brucella broth, were submitted to different concentrations of calcium hydroxide, chlorhexidine digluconate, camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol solutions. the drugs were diluted in the same culture broths, in  microplates and tubes, and were then incubated in anaerobiosis jars at 37 degrees c for 48 or 96 hours. the determination of mics was carried out through visual and spectrophotometric readings, and the determination of mbcs, through the plating of aliquots on rcm-blood agar. for that kind of study, the macromethod with spectrophotometric reading should be the natural choice. mics and mbcs obtained with the macromethod were compatible with the known clinical performance of the studied medications, and the values varied according to the bacteria and culture media employed. rcm was the most effective medium and c. perfringens, the most resistant microorganism.
