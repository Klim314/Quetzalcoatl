TI  == presence of zoonotic agents in engorged ticks and hedgehog faeces from erinaceus  europaeus in (sub) urban areas.
AB  == background: european hedgehogs (erinaceus europaeus) are hosts for ixodes hexagonus and i. ricinus ticks, which are vectors for zoonotic microorganisms. in addition, hedgehogs may carry several enteric zoonoses as well. it is unclear to  what extent a presence of pathogens in hedgehogs poses a risk to public health, as information on the presence of zoonotic agents in hedgehogs in urban areas is  relatively scarce. methods: engorged ticks and hedgehog faeces were collected from rehabilitating hedgehogs. ticks were screened individually for presence of borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, b. miyamotoi, anaplasma phagocytophilum, and candidatus neoehrlichia mikurensis using pcr-based assays. faecal samples were screened for presence of campylobacter, salmonella, giardia, cryptosporidium, and extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant-escherichia coli (esc)-resistant e. coli, using both culture-based and pcr-based methods. results: anaplasma phagocytophilum and borrelia genospecies b. afzelii, b. spielmanii, b. garinii, and b. burgdorferi sensu stricto were detected in both i. hexagonus and i. ricinus ticks. despite their widespread distribution in the netherlands, b. miyamotoi and candidatus n. mikurensis were not detected in collected ticks. analysis of hedgehog faecal samples revealed the presence of salmonella enterica  subspecies enterica and campylobacter jejuni. in addition, esc-resistant e. coli  were observed in high prevalence in faecal samples, but no shiga-toxin producing-e.coli were detected. finally, potentially zoonotic protozoan parasites were observed in hedgehog faecal samples as well, including giardia duodenalis assemblage a, cryptosporidium parvum subtypes iiaa17g1r1 and iica5g3, and c. hominis subtype iba10g2. conclusions: european hedgehogs in (sub)urban areas harbor a number of zoonotic agents, and therefore may contribute to the spread and transmission of zoonotic diseases. the relatively high prevalence of b. burgdorferi s.l. and a. phagocytophilum in engorged ticks, suggests that hedgehogs contribute to their enzootic cycles in (sub)urban areas. to what extent can hedgehogs maintain the enteric zoonotic agents in natural cycles, and the role of (spill-back from) humans remains to be investigated.

TI  == [etiology of diarrheal diseases in immunocompetent and hiv-positive patients].
AB  == in 1986 and 1987 the stool samples of 206 patients of the medical outpatient clinic basel were examined prospectively for bacteria, protozoa and worms. clinical data of the patients were recorded by questionnaire. the patient group comprised 63 immunocompetent patients as well as 23 hiv-infected patients, all with symptoms of acute enteritis. the control group consisted of 120 healthy persons. pathogenic organisms were found in the stools of 17.5% of the immunocompetent patients with enteritis. the most common germs were campylobacter jejuni, giardia lamblia and salmonella enteritidis. isospora belli, found in 2 cases (8.7%), was the only pathogen found in hiv-infected patients. the most frequent pathogen found in 7.5% of the control group was giardia lamblia. the facultative pathogenic protozoon blastocystis hominis was found in 16.7-19.0% of  the 3 groups. there was no correlation between clinical symptoms and the results  of stool examinations. stool examinations in the immunocompetent patients corresponded to the known distribution of pathogenic germs in switzerland. the homogeneous distribution of blastocystis hominis in the 3 groups examined proves  the high rate of infection. there is no evidence of a significant correlation between clinical symptoms of enteritis and infection with blastocystis hominis in immunocompetent patients.
