TI  == diets that differ in their fodmap content alter the colonic luminal microenvironment.
AB  == objective: a low fodmap (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diet reduces symptoms of ibs, but reduction of potential prebiotic and fermentative effects might adversely affect the colonic microenvironment. the effects of a low fodmap diet with a typical australian diet on biomarkers of colonic health were compared in a single-blinded, randomised, cross-over trial. design: twenty-seven ibs and six healthy subjects were randomly allocated one of two 21-day provided diets, differing only in fodmap content (mean (95% ci) low 3.05 (1.86 to 4.25) g/day vs australian 23.7 (16.9 to 30.6) g/day), and then crossed over to the other diet with >/=21-day washout period. faeces passed over a 5-day run-in on their habitual diet and from day 17 to day 21 of the interventional diets were pooled, and ph, short-chain fatty acid concentrations and bacterial abundance and diversity were assessed. results: faecal indices were similar in ibs and healthy subjects during habitual diets. the low fodmap diet was associated with higher faecal ph (7.37 (7.23 to 7.51) vs. 7.16 (7.02 to 7.30); p=0.001), similar short-chain fatty acid concentrations, greater microbial diversity and reduced total bacterial abundance (9.63 (9.53 to  9.73) vs. 9.83 (9.72 to 9.93) log10 copies/g; p<0.001) compared with the australian diet. to indicate direction of change, in comparison with the habitual diet the low fodmap diet reduced total bacterial abundance and the typical australian diet increased relative abundance for butyrate-producing clostridium cluster xiva (median ratio 6.62; p<0.001) and mucus-associated akkermansia muciniphila (19.3; p<0.001), and reduced ruminococcus torques. conclusions: diets differing in fodmap content have marked effects on gut microbiota composition. the implications of long-term reduction of intake of fodmaps require elucidation. trial registration number: actrn12612001185853.

TI  == mucolytic bacteria with increased prevalence in ibd mucosa augment in vitro utilization of mucin by other bacteria.
AB  == objectives: mucosa-associated bacteria are increased in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), which suggests the possibility of an increased source of digestible endogenous mucus substrate. we hypothesized that mucolytic bacteria are increased in ibd, providing increased substrate to sustain nonmucolytic mucosa-associated bacteria. methods: mucolytic bacteria were characterized by the ability to degrade human secretory mucin (muc2) in pure and mixed anaerobic cultures. real-time pcr was used to enumerate mucosa-associated mucolytic bacteria in 46 ibd and 20 control patients. bacterial mucolytic activity was tested in vitro using purified human muc2. results: we confirm increased total mucosa-associated bacteria 16s rrna gene in macroscopically and histologically normal intestinal epithelium of both crohn's disease (cd) (mean 1.9-fold) and ulcerative colitis (uc) (mean 1.3-fold). we found a disproportionate increase in  some mucolytic bacteria. mean ruminococcus gnavus were increased >4-fold and ruminococcus torques approximately 100-fold in macroscopically and histologically normal intestinal epithelium of both cd and uc. the most abundantly detected mucolytic bacterium in controls, akkermansia muciniphila, was reduced many fold in cd and in uc. coculture of a. muciniphila with muc2 as the sole carbon source  led to reduction in its abundance while it augmented growth of other bacteria. conclusions: mucolytic bacteria are present in healthy humans, where they are an  integral part of the mucosa-associated bacterial consortium. the disproportionate increase in r. gnavus and r. torques could explain increased total mucosa-associated bacteria in ibd.
