TI  == scavenging iron: a novel mechanism of plant immunity activation by microbial siderophores.
AB  == siderophores are specific ferric iron chelators synthesized by virtually all microorganisms in response to iron deficiency. we have previously shown that they promote infection by the phytopathogenic enterobacteria dickeya dadantii and erwinia amylovora. siderophores also have the ability to activate plant immunity. we have used complete arabidopsis transcriptome microarrays to investigate the global transcriptional modifications in roots and leaves of arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) plants after leaf treatment with the siderophore deferrioxamine (dfo). physiological relevance of these transcriptional modifications was validated experimentally. immunity and heavy-metal homeostasis  were the major processes affected by dfo. these two physiological responses could be activated by a synthetic iron chelator ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid, indicating that siderophores eliciting activities rely on their strong iron-chelating capacity. dfo was able to protect arabidopsis against the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000. siderophore treatment caused local modifications of iron distribution in leaf cells visible by ferrocyanide and diaminobenzidine-h(2)o(2)  staining. metal quantifications showed that dfo causes a transient iron and zinc  uptake at the root level, which is presumably mediated by the metal transporter iron regulated transporter1 (irt1). defense gene expression and callose deposition in response to dfo were compromised in an irt1 mutant. consistently, plant susceptibility to d. dadantii was increased in the irt1 mutant. our work shows that iron scavenging is a unique mechanism of immunity activation in plants. it highlights the strong relationship between heavy-metal homeostasis and immunity.

TI  == top 10 plant pathogenic bacteria in molecular plant pathology.
AB  == many plant bacteriologists, if not all, feel that their particular microbe should appear in any list of the most important bacterial plant pathogens. however, to our knowledge, no such list exists. the aim of this review was to survey all bacterial pathologists with an association with the journal molecular plant pathology and ask them to nominate the bacterial pathogens they would place in a  'top 10' based on scientific/economic importance. the survey generated 458 votes  from the international community, and allowed the construction of a top 10 bacterial plant pathogen list. the list includes, in rank order: (1) pseudomonas  syringae pathovars; (2) ralstonia solanacearum; (3) agrobacterium tumefaciens; (4) xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae; (5) xanthomonas campestris pathovars; (6) xanthomonas axonopodis pathovars; (7) erwinia amylovora; (8) xylella fastidiosa;  (9) dickeya (dadantii and solani); (10) pectobacterium carotovorum (and pectobacterium atrosepticum). bacteria garnering honourable mentions for just missing out on the top 10 include clavibacter michiganensis (michiganensis and sepedonicus), pseudomonas savastanoi and candidatus liberibacter asiaticus. this  review article presents a short section on each bacterium in the top 10 list and  its importance, with the intention of initiating discussion and debate amongst the plant bacteriology community, as well as laying down a benchmark. it will be  interesting to see, in future years, how perceptions change and which bacterial pathogens enter and leave the top 10.

TI  == genome-wide identification of hrpl-regulated genes in the necrotrophic phytopathogen dickeya dadantii 3937.
AB  == background: dickeya dadantii is a necrotrophic pathogen causing disease in many plants. previous studies have demonstrated that the type iii secretion system (t3ss) of d. dadantii is required for full virulence. hrpl is an alternative sigma factor that binds to the hrp box promoter sequence of t3ss genes to up-regulate their expression. methodology/principal findings: to explore the inventory of hrpl-regulated genes of d. dadantii 3937 (3937), transcriptome profiles of wild-type 3937 and a hrpl mutant grown in a t3ss-inducing medium were examined. using a cut-off value of 1.5, significant differential expression was observed in sixty-three genes, which are involved in various cellular functions such as type iii secretion, chemotaxis, metabolism, regulation, and stress response. a hidden markov model (hmm) was used to predict candidate hrp box binding sites in the intergenic regions of 3937, including the promoter regions of hrpl-regulated genes identified in the microarray assay. in contrast to biotrophic phytopathgens such as pseudomonas syringae, among the hrpl up-regulated genes in 3937 only those within the t3ss were found to contain a hrp box sequence. moreover, direct binding of purified hrpl protein to the hrp box was demonstrated for hrp box-containing dna fragments of hrpa and hrpn using the  electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa). in this study, a putative t3ss effector dspa/e was also identified as a hrpl-upregulated gene, and shown to be translocated into plant cells in a t3ss-dependent manner. conclusion/significances: we provide the genome-wide study of hrpl-regulated genes in a necrotrophic phytopathogen (d. dadantii 3937) through a combination of transcriptomics and bioinformatics, which led to identification of several effectors. our study indicates the extent of differences for t3ss effector protein inventory requirements between necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens, and may allow the development of different strategies for disease control for these different groups of pathogens.
