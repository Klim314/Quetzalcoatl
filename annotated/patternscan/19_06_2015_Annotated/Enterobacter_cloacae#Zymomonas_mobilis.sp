TI  == applications of protein engineering to members of the old yellow enzyme family.
AB  == in the 20years since massey's initial report in 1995, interest in using alkene reductases to prepare chiral intermediates for synthesis has grown rapidly. while native alkene reductases often show very high stereoselectivities toward favorable substrates, these enzymes have somewhat size-restricted active sites that limit their substrate ranges to small alkenes. in addition, most alkene reductases have the same stereoselectivities, which makes it difficult to access  the "other" product enantiomers. protein engineering strategies have been used to address both of these issues and good progress has been made in several cases. this review summarizes published examples through late 2014 and focuses on studies of six enzymes: saccharomyces pastorianus oye 1, tomato opr1, zymomonas mobilis ncr, enterobacter cloacae pb2 petn reductase, bacillus subtilis yqjm and  pichia stipitis oye 2.6.

TI  == cellulosic ethanol production by recombinant cellulolytic bacteria harbouring pdc and adh ii genes of zymomonas mobilis.
AB  == the ethanol fermenting genes such as pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase ii (adh ii) were cloned from zymomonas mobilis and transformed into three different cellulolytic bacteria, namely enterobacter cloacae jv, proteus mirabilis jv and erwinia chrysanthemi and their cellulosic ethanol production capability was studied. recombinant e. cloacae jv was found to produce 4.5% and 3.5% (v/v) ethanol, respectively, when cmc and 4% naoh pretreated bagasse were used as substrates, whereas recombinant p. mirabilis and e. chrysanthemi with the same substrates could only produce 4%, 3.5%, 1%, and 1.5 % of ethanol, respectively. the recombinant e. cloacae strain produced twofold higher percentage of ethanol than the wild type. the recombinant e. cloacae strain could be improved further by increasing its ethanol tolerance capability through media  optimization and also by combining multigene cellulase expression for enhancing ethanol production from various types of lignocellulosic biomass so that it can be used for industrial level ethanol production.

TI  == modeling of pyruvate decarboxylases from ethanol producing bacteria.
AB  == pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) is a key enzyme in homoethanol fermentation process, which decarboxylates 2-keto acid pyruvate into acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. pdc enzymes from potential ethanol-producing bacteria such as zymomonas mobilis,  zymobacter palmae and sarcina ventriculi have different k(m) and k(cat) values for the substrate pyruvate at their respective optimum ph. in this study, the putative three-dimensional structures of pdc dimer of z. palmae pdc and s. ventriculi pdc were generated based on the x-ray crystal structures of z. mobilis pdc, saccharomyces cerevisiae pdc form-a and enterobacter cloacae indolepyruvate  decarboxylase in order to compare the quaternary structures of these bacterial pdcs with respect to enzyme-substrate interactions, and subunit-subunit interfaces that might be related to the different biochemical characteristics. the procheck scores for both models were within recommended intervals. the generated models are similar to the x-ray crystal structure of z. mobilis pdc in  terms of binding modes of the cofactor, the position of mg(2+), and the amino acids that form the active sites. however, subunit-subunit interface analysis showed lower h-bonding in both models compared with x-ray crystal structure of z. mobilis pdc, suggesting a smaller interface area and the possibility of conformational change upon substrate binding in both models. both models have predicted lower affinity towards branched and aromatic 2-keto acids, which correlated with the molecular volumes of the ligands. the models shed valuable information necessary for further improvement of pdc enzymes for industrial production of ethanol and other products.

TI  == cellulosic ethanol production by zymomonas mobilis harboring an endoglucanase gene from enterobacter cloacae.
AB  == enterobactercloacae was isolated from the gut of the wood feeding termite, heterotermes indicola, and a 2.25-kb fragment conferring cellulase activity was cloned in escherichia coli. the cloned fragment contained a 1083-bp orf which could encode a protein belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 8. the cellulase gene was introduced into zymomonas mobilis strain microbial type culture collection centre (mtcc) on a plasmid and 0.134 filter paper activity unit (fpu)/ml units of cellulase activity was observed with the recombinant bacterium. using carboxymethyl cellulose and 4% naoh pretreated bagasse as substrates, the recombinant strain produced 5.5% and 4% (v/v) ethanol respectively, which was threefold higher than the amount obtained with the original e.cloacae isolate. the recombinant z. mobilis strain could be improved further by simultaneous expression of cellulase cocktails before utilizing it for industrial level ethanol production.

TI  == studies on structure-function relationships of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from  enterobacter cloacae, a key enzyme of the indole acetic acid pathway.
AB  == enterobacter cloacae, isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumbers, produces large  amounts of indole-3-acetic acid. indolepyruvate decarboxylase, the key enzyme in  the biosynthetic pathway of indole-3-acetic acid, catalyses the formation of indole-3-acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide from indole-3-pyruvic acid. the enzyme requires the cofactors thiamine diphosphate and magnesium ions for catalytic activity. recombinant indolepyruvate decarboxylase was purified from the host escherichia coli strain jm109. specificity of the enzyme for the substrates indole-3-pyruvic acid, pyruvic acid, benzoylformic acid, and seven benzoylformic  acid analogues was investigated using a continuous optical assay. stopped-flow kinetic data showed no indication for substrate activation in the decarboxylation reaction of indole-3-pyruvic acid, pyruvic acid or benzoylformic acid. size exclusion chromatography and small angle x-ray solution scattering experiments suggested the tetramer as the catalytically active state and a ph-dependent subunit association equilibrium. analysis of the kinetic constants of the benzoylformic acid analogues according to hansch et al. [hansch, c., leo, a., unger, s.h., kim, k.h., nikaitani, d & lien, e.j. (1973) j. med. chem.16, 1207-1216] and comparison with indole-3-pyruvic acid conversion by pyruvate decarboxylases from saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymomonas mobilis provided some  insight into the catalytic mechanism of indolepyruvate decarboxylase.

TI  == crystal structure of thiamindiphosphate-dependent indolepyruvate decarboxylase from enterobacter cloacae, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid.
AB  == the thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase catalyses the formation of indoleacetaldehyde from indolepyruvate, one step in the indolepyruvate pathway of biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid. the crystal structure of this enzyme from enterobacter cloacae has been determined at 2.65 a resolution and refined to a crystallographic r-factor of 20.5% (rfree 23.6%). the subunit of indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains three domains of open alpha/beta topology, which are similar in structure to that of pyruvate decarboxylase. the tetramer has pseudo 222 symmetry and can be described as a dimer of dimers. it resembles the tetramer of pyruvate decarboxylase from zymomonas mobilis, but with a relative difference of 20 degrees in the angle between the two dimers. active site residues are highly conserved in indolepyruvate/pyruvate decarboxylase, suggesting that the interactions with the  cofactor thiamin diphosphate and the catalytic mechanisms are very similar. the substrate binding site in indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains a large hydrophobic pocket which can accommodate the bulky indole moiety of the substrate. in pyruvate decarboxylases this pocket is smaller in size and allows discrimination of larger vs. smaller substrates. in most pyruvate decarboxylases, restriction of cavity size is due to replacement of residues at three positions by large, hydrophobic amino acids such as tyrosine or tryptophan.

TI  == specific spoilage organisms in breweries and laboratory media for their detection.
AB  == the gram positive bacteria are generally regarded as the most hazardous beer spoilage organisms in modern breweries, especially the lactobacilli: l. brevis, l. lindneri, l. curvatus, l. casei, l. buchneri, l. coryneformis, l. plantarum, l. brevisimilis, l. malefermentans and l. parabuchneri and the pediococci: p damnosus, p. inopinatus and p. dextrinicus. micrococcus kristinae is the only species within the micrococci relevant to brewing. the gram negative strictly anaerobic bacteria are apparently increasing in importance and include pectinatus cerevisiiphilus, pectinatus frisingensis and selenomonas lacticifex, reported as  obligate beer spoilage organisms: zymophilus raffinosivorans as a potential beer  spoilage organism; megasphaera cerevisiae as an obligate spoilage organism of low alcohol beer and zymomonas mobilis as capable of spoiling primed beer. with improved process technology the importance of aerobic bacteria has decreased and  the same applies for the gram negative aerobic bacteria hafnia protea and enterobacter cloacae which are capable of surviving beer fermentation. beer spoilage organisms include several so-called wild yeasts, of which saccharomyces  species are generally considered the most important. even though the detection of beer spoilage organisms by cultivation in laboratory media does not always provide the specificity and the sensitivity required, the use of selective media  and incubation conditions still appears to be the method preferred by breweries.  the media used depend on the type of sample, the specificity required and, for detection of wild yeasts, to some extent, the characteristics of the culture yeast. among the media reported so far no single medium can be used to detect all members within a group of specific beer spoilage organisms and further work on the development of improved substrates are required both for bacteria and wild yeasts.

TI  == the role of residues glutamate-50 and phenylalanine-496 in zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase.
AB  == several enzymes require thiamine diphosphate (thdp) as an essential cofactor, and we have used one of these, pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc; ec 4.1.1.1) from zymomonas mobilis, as a model for this group of enzymes. it is well suited for this purpose because of its stability, ease of purification, homotetrameric subunit structure and simple kinetic properties. crystallographic analyses of three thdp-dependent enzymes [muller, lindqvist, furey, schulz, jordan and schneider (1993) structure 1, 95-103] have suggested that an invariant glutamate  participates in catalysis. in order to evaluate the role of this residue, identified in pdc from zymomonas mobilis as glu-50, it has been altered to glutamine and aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned gene. the mutant proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. here we demonstrate that substitution with aspartate yields an enzyme with 3% of the activity of the wild-type, but with normal kinetics for pyruvate. replacement of glu-50 with glutamine yields an enzyme with only 0.5% of the catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme. each of these mutant enzymes has a decreased affinity for both  thdp and mg2+. it has been reported that the binding of cofactors to apopdc quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence [diefenbach and duggleby (1991) biochem. j. 276, 439-445] and we have identified the residue responsible as trp-487 [diefenbach, candy, mattick and duggleby (1992) febs lett. 296, 95-98]. although this residue is some distance from the cofactor binding site, it lies in the dimer interface, and the proposal has been put forward [dyda, furey, swaminathan, sax, farrenkopf and jordan (1993) biochemistry 32, 6165-6170] that alteration of ring stacking with phe-496 of the adjacent subunit is the mechanism of fluorescence quenching when cofactors bind. the closely related enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase (from enterobacter cloacae) has a leucine residue at the position corresponding to phe-496 but shows fluorescence quenching properties that are similar to those of pdc. this suggests that the fluorescence quenching is due to some perturbation of the local environment of trp-487 rather than to a  specific interaction with phe-496. this latter hypothesis is supported by our data: mutation of this phenylalanine to leucine, isoleucine or histidine in pdc does not eliminate the fluorescence quenching upon addition of cofactors.

TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of rpoh genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mrna and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  == the rpoh genes encoding homologs of escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): enterobacter cloacae (gamma), serratia marcescens (gamma), proteus mirabilis (gamma), agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and zymomonas mobilis (alpha). comparison of these and three known genes from e.coli (gamma), citrobacter freundii (gamma) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. both the sequence complementary to part of 16s rrna (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mrna secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in e.coli were found for the rpoh genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues q(r/k)(k/r)lffnlr, designated the 'rpoh box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in dnak/dnaj chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. in addition, a putative sigma e (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoh genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. these results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in e.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.

TI  == molecular cloning and sequence analysis of an azospirillum brasilense indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase gene.
AB  == azospirillum brasilense isolated from the rhizosphere of different plants has the ability to excrete indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) into the culture media. cosmid p0.2, isolated from an a. brasilense sp245 genome library in plafr1, complements  the tn5-induced mutant spm7918 of a. brasilense sp6 which excretes reduced amounts of iaa. restriction mapping and gene expression studies identified a bglii-ecori 4.3 kb fragment of p0.2 sufficient for the restoration of high levels of iaa production in mutant spm7918. tn5 mutagenesis localized the gene responsible on a 1.8 kb smai fragment. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains one complete open reading frame. the predicted protein sequence shows extensive homology with the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase of enterobacter cloacae and the pyruvate decarboxylases of saccharomyces cerevisiae  and zymomonas mobilis. the a. brasilense mutant sp245a, constructed by homogenotization of a tn5 insertion derivative of the 1.8 kb smai fragment, also  displayed reduced iaa production. introduction of the cloned wild-type gene into  rhizobium meliloti 1021 resulted in increased iaa production. cell-free extracts  prepared from r. meliloti and a. brasilense transconjugants harboring this gene could convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol. these results clearly demonstrate that iaa production in a. brasilense is mediated by indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase.

TI  == molecular cloning of the gene for indolepyruvate decarboxylase from enterobacter  cloacae.
AB  == although indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) is a well-known plant hormone, the main iaa biosynthetic pathway from l-tryptophan (trp) via indole-3-pyruvic acid (ipya) has yet to be elucidated. previous studies have suggested that iaa is produced by enterobacter cloacae isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumbers and its biosynthetic pathway may possibly be the same as that in plants. to elucidate this pathway, the iaa biosynthetic gene was isolated from a genomic library of e. cloacae by assaying for the ability to convert trp to iaa. dna sequence analysis  showed that this gene codes for only one enzyme and its predicted protein sequence has extensive homology with pyruvate decarboxylase in yeast and zymomonas mobilis. cell-free extracts prepared from escherichia coli harboring this gene could convert ipya to indole-3-acetaldehyde (iaald). these results clearly show that this pathway is mediated only by indolepyruvate decarboxylase,  which catalyzes the conversion of ipya to iaald.
