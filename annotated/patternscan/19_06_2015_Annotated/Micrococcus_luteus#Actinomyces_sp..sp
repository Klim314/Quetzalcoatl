TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == an indirect fluorescent antibody technique for detection of anti-dermatophilus congolensis antibodies in sheep.
AB  == an indirect fluorescent antibody (ifa) technique has been developed for detection of anti-dermatophilus antibodies in sheep. sera from 25 bacteriologically confirmed clinically affected sheep and from 10 negative non affected lambs were  used. whole cell antigen from brain heart infusion cultures of d. congolensis was used and all sera were tested in the same way for cross-reactivity against antigens obtained from cultures of actinomyces viscosus, micrococcus luteus, nocardia asteroides, and corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. sera from dermatophilus-infected sheep gave positive results with d. congolensis antigen and negative results with the antigens from other bacteria. the whole cell antigens employed were simple to prepare and easy to recognise by microscopy. cross-reactivity was further tested using the d. congolensis culture whole cell antigen and 3 sera from sheep with bacteriologically confirmed natural infections due to corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, actinomyces pyogenes and nocardia asteroides. none of these sera showed positive reactions. the authors recommend this technique for serological surveys and research on dermatophilosis.

TI  == protein synthesis in vitro by micrococcus luteus.
AB  == bacillus subtilis and related gram-positive bacteria which have low to moderate genomic g + c contents are unable to efficiently translate mrna derived from gram-negative bacteria, whereas escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria are able to translate mrna from both types of organisms. this phenomenon has been termed translational species specificity. ribosomes from the low-g + c-content group (low-g + c group) of gram-positive organisms (b. subtilis and relatives) lack an equivalent to escherichia ribosomal protein s1. the requirement for s1 for translation in e. coli (g. van dieijen, p. h. van knippenberg, j. van duin, b. koekman, and p. h. pouwels, mol. gen. genet. 153:75-80, 1977) and its specific role (a.r. subramanian, trends biochem. sci. 9:491-494, 1984) have been proposed. the group of gram-positive bacteria characterized by high genomic g + c content (formerly actinomyces species and relatives) contain s1, in contrast to the low-g + c group (k. mikulik, j. smardova, a. jiranova, and p. branny, eur. j. biochem.  155:557-563, 1986). it is not known whether members of the high-g + c group are translationally specific, although there is evidence that one genus, streptomyces, can express escherichia genes in vivo (m. j. bibb and s. n. cohen,  mol. gen. genet. 187:265-277, 1985; j. l. schottel, m. j. bibb, and s. n. cohen,  j. bacteriol. 146:360-368, 1981). in order to determine whether the organisms of  this group are translationally specific, we examined the in vitro translational characteristics of a member of the high-g + c group, micrococcus luteus, whose genomic g + c content is 73%. a semipurified coupled transcription-translation system of m. luteus translates escherichia mrna as well as bacillus and micrococcus mrna. therefore, m. luteus is translationally nonspecific and resembles e. coli rather than b. subtilis in its translational characteristics.

TI  == [studies of antigens related to metabolic and growth inhibitions of staphylococcus aureus l-form].
AB  == metabolic and growth inhibiting activities in immunoglobulin (of anti-s. aureus l-form serum and anti-s. aureus coccal form serum) could be absorbed by cell membranes of s. aureus l-form and its coccal form, respectively. these activities could not be absorbed by cell membrane of micrococcus luteus, streptococcus pyogenes or actinomyces viscosus. these findings suggested the existence of species-specific antigens of cell membrane. the membrane antigens of l-form related to the metabolic and growth inhibiting activities were stable to trypsin, heating and periodate, and were not solubilized by trypsin. a large part of the antigen in a typsin-insoluble membrane precipitate of l-form could be extracted by acetone and the subsequent use of chloroform-methanol (2: 1). a fractionation  study of chloroform-methanol extract by using silicic acid calum indicated that more than two components were involved in metabolic and growth inhibiting activities.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
