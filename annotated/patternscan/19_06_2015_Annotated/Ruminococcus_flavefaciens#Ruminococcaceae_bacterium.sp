TI  == diversity of butyrivibrio group bacteria in the rumen of goats and its response to the supplementation of garlic oil.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the diversity of the butyrivibrio group bacteria  in goat rumen and its response to garlic oil (go) supplementation as revealed by  molecular analysis of cloned 16s rrna genes. six wethers fitted with ruminal fistulas were assigned to two groups for a cross-over design with 28-d experimental period and 14-d interval. goats were fed a basal diet without (control) or with go ruminal infusion (0.8 g/d). ruminal contents were used for dna extraction collected before morning feeding on d 28. a total bacterial clone  library was firstly constructed by nearly full-length 16s rrna gene cloned sequences using universal primers. the resulting plasmids selected by butyrivibrio-specific primers were used to construct a butyrivibrio group-specific bacterial clone library. butyrivibrio group represented 12.98% and 10.95% of total bacteria in control and go group, respectively. in libraries, clones were classified to the genus pseudobutyrivibrio, butyrivibrio and others within the family lachnospiraceae. additionally, some specific clones were observed in go group, being classified to the genus ruminococcus and others within the family ruminococcaceae. based on the criterion that the similarity was 97% or greater with database sequences, there were 29.73% and 18.42% of clones identified as known isolates (i.e. b. proteoclasticus and ps. ruminis) in control and go groups, respectively. further clones identified as b. fibrisolvens (5.41%) and r. flavefaciens (7.89%) were specifically found in control and go groups, respectively. the majority of clones resembled ps. ruminis (98% to 99% similarity), except for lachnospiraceae bacteria (87% to 92% similarity) in the two libraries. the two clone libraries also appeared different in shannon diversity index (control 2.47 and go group 2.91). our results indicated that the  butyrivibrio group bacteria had a complex community with considerable unknown species in the goat rumen.

TI  == probiotic dosing of ruminococcus flavefaciens affects rumen microbiome structure  and function in reindeer.
AB  == highly cellulolytic bacterial species such as ruminococcus flavefaciens are regarded essential for the microbial breakdown of cellulose in the rumen. we have investigated the effect of ruminal dosing of r. flavefaciens strain 8/94-32 during realimentation of starved reindeer (males, n = 3). microbiome function measured as in situ digestion of cellulose and food pellets (percent dmd; dry matter disappearance) decreased after probiotic dosing. microbial community analyses (>100,000 16s rdna gene sequences for 27 samples) demonstrated that ruminal dosing influenced the microbiome structure; reflected by increased phylogenetic distances from background samples (unweighted unifrac analysis) and  reduced species diversity and evenness. despite the inability to detect strain 8/94-32 post-dosing, the relative abundance of its affiliate family ruminococcaceae remained consistent throughout the trial, whilst a dominant peak  in the genus prevotella and decline in uncharacterized bacteroidetes (ubacnr) were observed in treatment samples. no clear relationships were observed between  the relative abundance of ruminococcaceae, prevotella and ubacnr with cellulose dmd; however, prevotella (negative) and ubacnr (positive) exhibited relationships with pellet dmd. these unexpected effects of ruminal dosing of a cellulolytic bacterium on digestibility are relevant for other studies on rumen manipulation.

TI  == populations of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen of sheep and  the effect of diets and ruminal fractions.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the importance of select cultured and uncultured bacteria in the rumen by quantifying their populations and the effect  of diets and ruminal fractions. full-length 16s rrna gene (rrs) sequences were recovered from rumen samples using specific primers designed from partial sequences recovered previously. five uncultured bacterial operational taxonomic units (otus) were quantified using specific quantitative pcr (qpcr) in fractionated ruminal samples from sheep fed either hay alone or hay plus corn. species fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus albus, r. flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, selenomonas ruminantium, and mitsuokella multacida and  genera butyrivibrio and prevotella were also quantified as comparison. the full-length rrs sequence improved taxonomic assignments of partial rrs sequences. genus prevotella had the greatest abundance. of the three major cultured cellulolytic species, r. flavefaciens was most abundant, followed by r. albus and f. succinogenes. the five uncultured bacterial otus, classified to genus acetivibrio, genus allobaculum, family ruminococcaceae, order clostridiales, or class clostridia, had abundance comparable to that of the above species of genera except prevotella. corn supplementation and fractions affected distribution of the rumen bacteria, but to a limited extent. when compared to the qpcr data, sequence frequencies in the rrs clone libraries tended to overestimate the abundance of the bacteria represented. this study showed that abundance and population dynamics of uncultured bacteria can be quantified by specific qpcr, which complements the results of rrs clone libraries. this study also revealed that some uncultured bacteria might be as important as some of the well-characterized bacteria in the rumen. the approach used should be applicable  to assess the abundance and potential importance of uncultured bacteria in other  environments.

TI  == ruminococcus champanellensis sp. nov., a cellulose-degrading bacterium from human gut microbiota.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic, cellulolytic strain, designated 18p13(t), was isolated from a human faecal sample. cells were gram-positive non-motile cocci. strain 18p13(t) was able to degrade microcrystalline cellulose but the utilization of soluble sugars was restricted to cellobiose. acetate and succinate were the major end products of cellulose and cellobiose fermentation. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate belonged to the genus ruminococcus of the family ruminococcaceae. the closest phylogenetic relative was the ruminal cellulolytic strain ruminococcus flavefaciens atcc 19208(t) (<95% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity). the dna g+c content of strain 18p13(t) was 53.05+/-0.7 mol%. on the basis of phylogenetic analysis, and morphological and physiological  data, strain 18p13(t) can be differentiated from other members of the genus ruminococcus with validly published names. the name ruminococcus champanellensis  sp. nov. is proposed, with 18p13(t) (=dsm 18848(t)=jcm 17042(t)) as the type strain.
