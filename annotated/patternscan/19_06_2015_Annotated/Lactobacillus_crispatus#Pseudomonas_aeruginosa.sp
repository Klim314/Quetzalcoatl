TI  == protease-sensitive inhibitory activity of cell-free supernatant of lactobacillus  crispatus 156 synergizes with ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and streptomycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa: an in vitro study.
AB  == ciprofloxacin and streptomycin are frequently prescribed for the treatment of medical conditions originating due to infection by pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, fluoroquinolone administration has been linked to the outgrowth of clostridium difficile pathogen, especially in immunocompromised patients. secondly, frequent administration of antibiotics may lead to development of resistance in the pathogens. thus, there is a need to explore innovative adjunct  therapies to lower the therapeutic doses of the antibiotics. herein, we evaluated the synergism, if any, between conventional antibiotics and the cell-free supernatant (cfs) of vaginal lactobacillus crispatus 156 against p. aeruginosa mtcc 741. l. crispatus 156 was isolated from the human vaginal tract, and its cfs had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against various gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including p. aeruginosa. the inhibitory substance present in the cfs completely lost its activity after treatment with proteinases  and was resistant to temperatures up to 80 degrees c and ph ranging from 2 to 6.  the cumulative production of the inhibitory substance in cfs was studied, and it  showed that the secretion of the inhibitory substance was initiated in middle log phase of growth and peaked in late log phase. further, cfs synergized the activities of ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and streptomycin as evaluated in terms of checkerboard titrations. it lowered the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of ciprofloxacin by almost 30 times and mic of both moxifloxacin and streptomycin by 8 times. interestingly, pepsin treatment of cfs caused the complete abrogation of its synergistic effect with all the three antibiotics. thus, from the study, it can be concluded that probiotic-based alternative therapeutic regimen can be designed for the treatment of p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms and hydrogen peroxide production of indigenous lactobacilli isolated from vagina of chinese pregnant women.
AB  == objective: to investigate the indigenous lactobacilli from the vagina of pregnant women and to screen the isolates with antagonistic potential against pathogenic microorganisms. methods: the strains were isolated from pregnant women's vagina and identified using the api50ch system. the ability of the isolates to produce hydrogen peroxide was analyzed semi-quantitatively using the tmb-hrp-mrs agar. the antagonistic effects of the isolates on pathogenic microorganisms were determined with a double layer agar plate. results: one hundred and three lactobacilli strains were isolated from 60 samples of vaginal secretion from healthy pregnant women. among them, 78 strains could produce hydrogen peroxide, in which 68%, 80%, 80%, and 88% had antagonistic effects against candida albicans cmcc98001, staphylococcus aureus cmcc26003, escherichia coli cmcc44113, and pseudomonas aeruginosa cmcc10110, respectively. conclusion: the recovery of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli decreases with the increasing pregnant age and time. the most commonly isolated species from vagina of chinese pregnant  women are lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus crispatus. most of l. acidophilus and l. crispatus produce a high h2o2 level.

TI  == assessment of the capacity of lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == to gain insight into the mechanisms by which lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. lactobacilli from hemagglutination group iii, identified as lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups ii and i (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa pa5 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and staphylococcus aureus sa11 and proteus mirabilis pm1 were the most resistant. lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). p. aeruginosa pa5 was the most inhibited, and enterococcus species e15 was the least inhibited. there is considerable variation among lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen  growth. although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.
