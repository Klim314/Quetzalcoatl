TI  == structural modelling, substrate binding and stability studies of endopectate lyase (pl1b) of family 1 polysaccharide lyase from clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == an endo-pectate lyase (pl1b) of family 1 polysaccharide lyase from clostridium thermocellum was structurally characterized and its stability under chaotropic agent was determined. the putative domain pl1b was identified from the protein sequence abn53381.1 belonging to superfamily 3 of pectate lyase. multiple sequence alignment of pl1b with other known pectate lyases revealed the conserved and semi-conserved residues. the secondary structure of pl1b predicted by psipred and confirmed by circular dichroism showed the presence of 2 alpha-helices (2.06%), 26 beta-strands (40.54%) and 29 random coils (57.4%). the modelled protein represented right handed parallel beta-helix structure, where three parallel beta-sheets linked by loops coils around to form the beta-helix core. quality assessment of energy minimized structure by ramachandran plot displayed 82.8% residues in favoured region. superposition of pl1b structure with bsp165-pela from bacillus sp. revealed the substrate binding cleft formed by the  amino acid residues from the loops and beta-sheet. molecular dynamic simulation of modelled pl1b structure inferred that it is quite stable and compact. docking  studies identified asp151, arg209, asn234, arg236, tyr271 and ser272 as the key residues of pl1b involved during catalysis. among them arg209 is responsible for  proton abstraction during beta-elimination. protein melting studies on pl1b showed that there was 12 degrees c shift of peak from 74 to 86 degrees c in presence of 0.6 mm ca(2+) ions, showing that they provide stability to the structure. the unfolding of pl1b by guhcl or urea by fluorescence study showed that the protein structure is stable and disintegrates at their higher concentrations.

TI  == microbiological contamination of dried and lyophilized garlic as a potential source of food spoilage.
AB  == garlic is valued more for its flavoring and used in a wide variety of foods. in food technology, fresh garlic is not used, but instead its processed forms, most  often dried and lyophilized, are utilized. the quality and safety of the final product largely depends on their microbiological quality. this research has provided information about effect of garlic fixation methods and provided information about effect of microbiological contamination of garlic used as a spice for quality of garlic mayonnaise sauce. the authors decided to undertake studies following a report from one of the manufacturers of garlic sauces on product defects which originated in dried garlic used in the production process.  samples of garlic (n = 26) were examinated using standard cultural methods (counts of fungi, lactic acid bacteria-lab, spore-producing bacillus sp. and the  presence of anaerobic saccharolytic and proteolytic clostridia), automated system tempo (total viable count, enterobacteriaceae), immunoenzymatic method using vidas tests (occurrence of salmonella sp. and listeria monocytogenes). the number of total viable count was ranged from 3.51 to 6.85 log cfu/g. enterobacteriaceae  were detected only in one sample. comparably low values were recorded for fungi (1.30 to 3.47 log cfu/g). the number of lab was ranged from 2.34 to 5.49 log cfu/g. clostridium sp. were detected in 22 samples. salmonella sp. and listeria monocytogenes were not detected. it was found that garlic, regardless of th preservation procedure, might be a source of contamination of garlic mayonnaise sauce especially with lactic acid bacteria and clostridium sp. spores.

TI  == a sequential statistical approach towards an optimized production of a broad spectrum bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium bacillus sp. yas 1 strain.
AB  == bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides, display potential applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. the present study highlights integral statistical optimization and partial characterization of a bacteriocin substance from a soil bacterium taxonomically affiliated as bacillus sp. yas 1 after biochemical and molecular identifications. a sequential statistical approach (plackett-burman and box-behnken) was employed to optimize bacteriocin (bac yas 1) production. using optimal levels of three key determinants (yeast extract (0.48% (w/v), incubation time (62 hrs), and agitation speed (207 rpm)) in peptone yeast beef based production medium resulted in 1.6-fold enhancement in bac yas 1 level (470 au/ml arbitrary units against erwinia amylovora). bac yas 1  showed activity over a wide range of ph (1-13) and temperature (45-80 degrees c). a wide spectrum antimicrobial activity of bac yas 1 against the human pathogens (clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus epidermidis, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus sp., proteus sp., klebsiella sp., and salmonella typhimurium), the plant pathogen (e. amylovora), and the food spoiler  (listeria innocua) was demonstrated. on top and above, bac yas 1 showed no antimicrobial activity towards lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. lactis, and l. reuteri). promising characteristics of bac yas 1 prompt  its commercialization for efficient utilization in several industries.

TI  == spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-clostridium activity from actinomadura sp. 2eps.
AB  == the rare actinomycetes strain 2eps was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell  wall, and 16s rrna gene sequence indicates that 2eps belongs to genus actinomadura. in addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the  relationships of this strain to other members of actinomadura. a butanol extract  with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. the structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)h-nmr and (13)c-nmr) and mass spectrometric analysis (hr-tof-ms). compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the japanese patent number jp 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are be-45722a (1), be-45722b (2) and be-45722c (3), respectively. all compounds were active against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, and b. subtilis atcc 6633) with low mic values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar mic values, against clostridium perfringens s107 at 0.63 microg/ml and c. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. these results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of clostridium infections. overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == characterization of rumen bacterial strains isolated from enrichments of rumen content in the presence of propolis.
AB  == propolis presents many biological properties, including antibacterial activities, and has been proposed as an additive in ruminant nutrition. twenty bacterial strains, previously isolated from enrichments of brazilian cow rumen contents in  the presence of different propolis extracts (llos), were characterized using phenotyping and 16s rrna identification. seven strains were assigned to streptococcus sp., most likely s. bovis, and were all degrading starch. one amylolytic lactate-utilizing strain of selenomonas ruminantium was also found. two strains of clostridium bifermentans were identified and showed proteolytic activity. two strains were assigned to mitsuokella jalaludinii and were saccharolytic. one strain belonged to a bacillus species and seven strains were affiliated with escherichia coli. all of the 20 strains were able to use many sugars, but none of them were able to degrade the polysaccharides carboxymethylcellulose and xylans. the effect of three propolis extracts (llos b1, c1 and c3) was tested on the in vitro growth of four representative isolates  of s. bovis, e. coli, m. jalaludinii and c. bifermentans. the growth of s. bovis, e. coli and m. jalaludinii was not affected by the three propolis extracts at 1 mg ml(-1). c. bifermentans growth was completely inhibited at this llos concentration, but this bacterium was partially resistant at lower concentrations. llos c3, with the lower concentration of phenolic compounds, was  a little less inhibitory than b1 and c1 on this strain.

TI  == effect of feeding bacillus subtilis natto on hindgut fermentation and microbiota  of holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the effect of bacillus subtilis natto on hindgut fermentation and microbiota of early lactation holstein dairy cows was investigated in this study. thirty-six holstein dairy cows in early lactation were randomly allocated to three groups: no b. subtilis natto as the control group, b. subtilis natto with 0.5x10(11) cfu  as dmf1 group and b. subtilis natto with 1.0x10(11) cfu as dmf2 group. after 14 days of adaptation period, the formal experiment was started and lasted for 63 days. fecal samples were collected directly from the rectum of each animal on the morning at the end of eighth week and placed into sterile plastic bags. the ph, nh3-n and vfa concentration were determined and fecal bacteria dna was extracted  and analyzed by dgge. the results showed that the addition of b. subtilus natto at either treatment level resulted in a decrease in fecal nh3-n concentration but had no effect on fecal ph and vfa. the dgge profile revealed that b. subtilis natto affected the population of fecal bacteria. the diversity index of shannon-wiener in dfm1 decreased significantly compared to the control. fecal alistipes sp., clostridium sp., roseospira sp., beta proteobacterium were decreased and bifidobacterium was increased after supplementing with b. subtilis  natto. this study demonstrated that b. subtilis natto had a tendency to change fecal microbiota balance.

TI  == composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts of some acinos miller species.
AB  == gc and gc/ms analyses of the methanol extracts obtained from the aerial parts of  six acinos miller species from serbia and montenegro were performed. seventy-four constituents, accounting for 84.9-99.0% of the total composition of the extracts, were identified. the common feature of the a. suaveolens, a. majoranifolius and a. alpinus methanol extracts was the high content of monoterpenes, while the common feature of the a. graveolens, a. arvensis and a. hungaricus methanol extracts was the prevalence of sesquiterpenes. the total flavonoids, polyphenols  and tannins content, as well as antioxidant activity (frap and dpph assay) of the methanolic extracts were investigated. the highest antioxidant activity was observed in the extract of a. alpinus which had high levels of all polyphenol classes examined. a disk diffusion method was used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activities of the extracts against a panel of microorganisms (bacteria: bacillus subtilis, clostridium pyogenes, enterococcus sp., micrococcus flavus, sarcina lutea, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli; fungi: aspergillus niger, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae). the preliminary bioassay results indicated that the methanol extract of a. alpinus could be a possible source of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  == calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in astragali radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. however, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria  to metabolize calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, five strains including bacteroides  sp.13, and sp.58, clostridium sp.21-2, veillonella sp.43-1, and bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to  convert calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. a total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (uplc-q-tof-ms). the results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. on the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus, bifidobacterium were less severely affected. this indicates that calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-o-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.

TI  == the influence of fat and monoacylglycerols on growth of spore-forming bacteria in processed cheese.
AB  == highly undesirable microbial contaminants of processed cheese are endospore-forming bacteria of the genera bacillus and clostridium. survival of bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, clostridium butyricum and c. sporogenes was examined in model processed cheese samples supplemented with monoacylglycerols. in processed cheese samples, monoacylglycerols of undecanoic, undecenoic, lauric  and adamantane-1-carboxylic acid at concentration of 0.15% w/w prevented the growth and multiplication of both bacillus species throughout the storage period. the two species of clostridium were less affected by monoacylglycerols in processed cheese samples and only partial inhibition was observed. the effect of  milk fat content on microbial survival in processed cheese was also evaluated. the growth of bacillus sp. was affected by the fat level of processed cheese while population levels of clostridium sp. did not differ in processed cheese samples with 30, 40 and 50% fat in dry matter.

TI  == effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  == licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional chimese medicines. however, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate  to exert physiological effects. therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. finally, six strains, comprising bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, bacillus sp. 46 and clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. a total  of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. the results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin.  on the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an emax precision microplate reader. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as enterobacter, enterococcus, clostridium and  bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as lactobacillus and bifidobacterium was less severely affected.  our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == degradation of lignocelluloses in rice straw by bmc-9, a composite microbial system.
AB  == to evaluate the potential utility of pretreatment of raw biomass with a complex microbial system, we investigated the degradation of rice straw by bmc-9, a lignocellulose decomposition strain obtained from a biogas slurry compost environment. the degradation characteristics and corresponding changes in the bacterial community were assessed. the results showed that rapid degradation occurred from day 0 to day 9, with a peak total biomass bacterium concentration of 3.3 x 10(8) copies/ml on day 1. the ph of the fermentation broth declined initially and then increased, and the mass of rice straw decreased steadily. the  highest concentrations of volatile fatty acid contents (0.291 mg/l lactic acid, 0.31 mg/l formic acid, 1.93 mg/l acetic acid, and 0.73 mg/l propionic acid) as well as the highest xylanse activity (1.79 u/ml) and carboxymethyl cellulase activity (0.37 u/ml) occurred on day 9. the greatest diversity among the microbial community also occurred on day 9, with the presence of bacteria belonging to clostridium sp., bacillus sp., and geobacillus sp. together, our results indicate that bmc-9 has a strong ability to rapidly degrade the lignocelluloses of rice straw under relatively inexpensive conditions, and the optimum fermentation time is 9 days.

TI  == dynamics of hydrogen-producing bacteria in a repeated batch fermentation process  using lake sediment as inoculum.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of lake sediment as inoculum for hydrogen production through dark fermentation in a repeated batch process. in addition, we investigated the effect of heat treatment, applied to enrich hydrogen-producing bacteria, on the bacterial composition and metabolism. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and molecular cloning, both performed using the 16s rdna gene as target gene, were used to monitor the structure of the bacterial community. hydrogen production and bacterial metabolism were analysed via gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. both treated and non-treated inocula were able to produce high amounts of hydrogen. however, statistical analysis showed a clear difference in their bacterial composition and metabolism. the heat treatment favoured the growth of different clostridia sp., in particular of clostridium bifermentans, allowing the production of a constant  amount of hydrogen over prolonged time. these cultures showed both butyrate and ethanol fermentation types. absence of heat treatment allowed species belonging to the genera bacillus, sporolactobacillus and massilia to outgrow clostridia sp. with a reduction in hydrogen production and a significant metabolic change. our data indicate that lake sediment harbours bacteria that can efficiently produce hydrogen over prolonged fermentation time. moreover, we could show that the heat  treatment stabilizes the bacterial community composition and the hydrogen production.

TI  == [key enzymes in butanol fermentation by a facultative anaerobe bacillus sp. tsh1].
AB  == bacillus sp. tsh1 is a butanol-producing microorganism newly isolated in our laboratory; it can grow and ferment under facultative anaerobic conditions, while sharing similar fermentation pathways and products with clostridium acetobutylicum. to illustrate the relationships between the products and the enzyme activities in bacillus sp. tsh1, key butanol- and ethanol-forming enzymes  were studied, including butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, butanol dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. the activities of the three enzymes increased rapidly after the initiation of fermentation. activities of three enzymes peaked before 21 h, and simultaneously, product concentrations also began to increase gradually. the maximum activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was 0.054 u/mg at 12 h,  butyraldehyde dehydrogenase 0.035 u/mg at 21 h and butanol dehydrogenase 0.055 u/mg at 15 h. the enzyme activities then decreased, but remained constant at a low level after 24 h, while the concentrations of butanol, acetone, and ethanol continued increasing until the end of the fermentation. the results will attribute to the understanding of the butanol metabolic mechanism, and provide a  reference for further study of a facultative bacillus metabolic pathway.

TI  == co-culturing a novel bacillus strain with clostridium tyrobutyricum atcc 25755 to produce butyric acid from sucrose.
AB  == background: currently, the most promising microorganism used for the bio-production of butyric acid is clostridium tyrobutyricum atcc 25755t; however, it is unable to use sucrose as a sole carbon source. consequently, a newly isolated strain, bacillus sp. sgp1, that was found to produce a levansucrase enzyme, which hydrolyzes sucrose into fructose and glucose, was used in a co-culture with this strain, permitting c. tyrobutyricum atcc 25755t to ferment sucrose to butyric acid. results: b. sp. sgp1 alone did not show any butyric acid production and the main metabolite produced was lactic acid. this allowed c. tyrobutyricum atcc 25755t to utilize the monosaccharides resulting from the activity of levansucrase together with the lactic acid produced by b. sp. sgp1 to generate butyric acid, which was the main fermentative product within the co-culture. furthermore, the final acetic acid concentration in the co-culture was significantly lower when compared with pure c. tyrobutyricum atcc 25755t cultures grown on glucose. in fed-batch fermentations, the optimum conditions for the production of butyric acid were around ph 5.50 and a temperature of 37 degrees c. under these conditions, the final butyrate concentration was 34.2+/-1.8 g/l with yields of 0.35+/-0.03 g butyrate/g sucrose and maximum productivity of 0.3+/-0.04 g/l/h. conclusions: using this co-culture, sucrose can be utilized as a carbon source for butyric acid production at a relatively high yield. in addition, this co-culture offers also the benefit of a greater selectivity, with butyric acid constituting 92.8% of the acids when the fermentation was terminated.

TI  == spoiva and sipl are clostridium difficile spore morphogenetic proteins.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen whose infections are difficult to treat because of their frequent recurrence. the spores of c. difficile are responsible for these clinical features, as they resist common disinfectants and antibiotic treatment. although spores are the major transmissive form of c. difficile, little is known about their composition or morphogenesis. spore morphogenesis has been well characterized for bacillus sp.,  but bacillus sp. spore coat proteins are poorly conserved in clostridium sp. of the known spore morphogenetic proteins in bacillus subtilis, spoiva is one of the mostly highly conserved in the bacilli and the clostridia. using genetic analyses, we demonstrate that spoiva is required for proper spore morphogenesis in c. difficile. in particular, a spoiva mutant exhibits defects in spore coat localization but not cortex formation. our study also identifies sipl, a previously uncharacterized protein found in proteomic studies of c. difficile spores, as another critical spore morphogenetic protein, since a sipl mutant phenocopies a spoiva mutant. biochemical analyses and mutational analyses indicate that spoiva and sipl directly interact. this interaction depends on the  walker a atp binding motif of spoiva and the lysm domain of sipl. collectively, these results provide the first insights into spore morphogenesis in c. difficile.

AB  == the phylogenetic diversity of the bacteria in hot composting samples collected from three spatial locations was investigated by molecular tools in order to determine the influence of gradient effect on bacterial communities during the thermophilic phase of composting swine manure with rice straw. total microbial dna was extracted and bacterial near full-length 16s rrna genes were subsequently amplified, cloned, restriction fragment length polymorphism-screened and sequenced. the superstratum sample had the highest microbial diversity among the  three samples which was possibly related to the surrounding conditions of the sample resulting from the location. the results showed that the sequences related to bacillus sp. were most common in the composts. in superstratum sample, 45 clones (33%) and 36 clones (27%) were affiliated with the bacillus sp. and clostridium sp., respectively; 74 clones (58%) were affiliated with the clostridium sp. in the middle-level sample; 52 clones (40%) and 29 clones (23%) were affiliated with the clostridium sp. and bacillus sp. in substrate sample, respectively. it indicated that the microbial diversity and community in the samples were different for each sampling site, and different locations of the same pile often contained distinct and different microbial communities.

TI  == production of xynx, a large multimodular protein of thermoanaerobacterium sp., by protease-deficient bacillus subtilis strains [corrected].
AB  == xynx of thermoanaerobacterium sp. [corrected] is a large, multimodular xylanase of 116 kda. an escherichia coli transformant carrying the entire xynx produced three active truncated xylanase species of 105, 85, and 64 kda intracellularly. the bacillus subtilis wb700 transformant with the xynx, a strain deficient in seven proteases including vpr, secreted two active truncated xylanase species of  65 and 44 kda. the b. subtilis wb800 transformant with xynx, a strain deficient in eight proteases including vpr and wpra, secreted more active enzymes, 8.46 u ml(-1), mostly in the form of 105 and 85 kda, than the wb700 transformant, 6.93 u ml(-1). this indicates that the additional deletion of wpra enabled the wb800 to  secrete xynx in its intact form. b. subtilis wb800 produced more total enzyme activity than e. coli (1,692 +/- 274 u vs. 141.9 +/- 27.1 u), and, more importantly, secreted almost all the enzyme activity. the results suggest the potential use of b. subtilis wb800 as a host system for the production of large multimodular proteins.

TI  == the genomic basis for the evolution of a novel form of cellular reproduction in the bacterium epulopiscium.
AB  == background: epulopiscium sp. type b, a large intestinal bacterial symbiont of the surgeonfish naso tonganus, does not reproduce by binary fission. instead, it forms multiple intracellular offspring using a process with morphological features similar to the survival strategy of endospore formation in other firmicutes. we hypothesize that intracellular offspring formation in epulopiscium evolved from endospore formation and these two developmental programs share molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the observed morphological similarities. results: to test this, we sequenced the genome of epulopiscium sp.  type b to draft quality. comparative analysis with the complete genome of its close, endospore-forming relative, cellulosilyticum lentocellum, identified homologs of well-known sporulation genes characterized in bacillus subtilis. of the 147 highly conserved b. subtilis sporulation genes used in this analysis, we  found 57 homologs in the epulopiscium genome and 87 homologs in the c. lentocellum genome. conclusions: genes coding for components of the central regulatory network which govern the expression of forespore and mother-cell-specific sporulation genes and the machinery used for engulfment appear best conserved. low conservation of genes expressed late in endospore formation, particularly those that confer resistance properties and encode germinant receptors, suggest that epulopiscium has lost the ability to form a mature spore. our findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of a novel form of cellular reproduction.

TI  == culture-based and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the bacterial community structure from the intestinal tracts of earthworms(eisenia fetida).
AB  == the bacterial communities in the intestinal tracts of earthworm were investigated by culture-dependent and - independent approaches. in total, 72 and 55 pure cultures were isolated from the intestinal tracts of earthworms under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. aerobic bacteria were classified as aeromonas (40%), bacillus (37%), photobacterium (10%), pseudomonas (7%), and shewanella (6%). anaerobic bacteria were classified as aeromonas (52%), bacillus (27%), shewanella (12%), paenibacillus (5%), clostridium (2%), and cellulosimicrobium (2%). the dominant microorganisms were aeromonas and bacillus species under both  aerobic and anaerobic conditions. in all, 39 dna fragments were identified by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analysis. aeromonas sp. was the dominant microorganism in feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms. the dgge band intensity of aeromonas from feeds, intestinal tracts, and casts of earthworms was 12.8%, 14.7%, and 15.1%, respectively. the other strains identified were bacillus, clostridium, enterobacter, photobacterium, pseudomonas, shewanella, streptomyces, uncultured chloroflexi bacterium, and uncultured bacterium. these results suggest that pcr-dgge analysis was more efficient than the culture-dependent approach for the  investigation of bacterial diversity and the identification of unculturable microorganisms.

TI  == effects of stimulation of copper bioleaching on microbial community in vineyard soil and copper mining waste.
AB  == long-term copper application in vineyards and copper mining activities cause heavy metal pollution sites. such sites need remediation to protect soil and water quality. bioremediation of contaminated areas through bioleaching can help  to remove copper ions from the contaminated soils. thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of different treatments for copper bioleaching in two diverse copper-contaminated soils (a 40-year-old vineyard and a copper mining waste) and to evaluate the effect on microbial community by applying denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s ribosomal dna amplicons and dna sequence analysis. several treatments with hcl, h(2)so(4), and feso(4) were evaluated by stimulation of bioleaching of copper in the soils. treatments and extractions using feso(4) and h(2)so(4) mixture at 30 degrees c displayed more copper leaching than extractions with deionized water at room temperature. treatment with h(2)so(4) supported bioleaching of as much as 120 mg kg(-1) of copper from vineyard soil after 115 days of incubation. dgge analysis of the treatments revealed that some treatments caused greater diversity of microorganisms in the vineyard soil compared to the copper mining waste. nucleotide blast of pcr-amplified fragments of 16s rrna gene bands from dgge indicated the presence of rhodobacter sp., silicibacter sp., bacillus sp., paracoccus sp., pediococcus sp., a myxococcales, clostridium sp., thiomonas sp.,  a firmicute, caulobacter vibrioides, serratia sp., and an actinomycetales in vineyard soil. contrarily, sphingomonas was the predominant genus in copper mining waste in most treatments. paracoccus sp. and enterobacter sp. were also identified from dgge bands of the copper mining waste. paracoccus species is involved in the copper bioleaching by sulfur oxidation system, liberating the copper bounded in the soils and hence promoting copper bioremediation. results indicate that stimulation of bioleaching with a combination of feso(4) and h(2)so(4) promoted bioleaching in the soils and can be employed ex situ to remediate copper-impacted soils.

TI  == caloramator boliviensis sp. nov., a thermophilic, ethanol-producing bacterium isolated from a hot spring.
AB  == a novel moderately thermophilic, anaerobic, ethanol-producing bacterial strain, 45b(t), was isolated from a mixed sediment water sample collected from a hot spring at potosi, bolivia. the cells were straight to slightly curved rods approximately 2.5 microm long and 0.5 microm wide. the strain was gram-stain-variable, spore-forming and monotrichously flagellated. growth of the  strain was observed at 45-65 degrees c and ph 5.5-8.0, with optima of 60 degrees  c and ph 6.5. the substrates utilized by strain 45b(t) were xylose, cellobiose, glucose, arabinose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, fructose, galactose, mannose, glycerol, xylan, carboxymethylcellulose and yeast extract. the main fermentation  product from xylose and cellobiose was ethanol (0.70 and 0.45 g ethanol per gram  of consumed sugar, respectively). acetate, lactate, propionate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen were also produced in minor quantities. 1,3-propanediol was produced when glycerol-containing medium was supplemented with yeast extract. the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-c(15:0), c(16:0), iso-c(16:0), c(15:1), iso-c(14:0), c(13:0) and c(14:0). the polar lipids diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, an aminoglycolipid and 15 other unidentified lipids were predominant. the dna g+c content of strain 45b(t) was 32.6 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequence similarity revealed that strain 45b(t) is located within the gram-type positive bacillus-clostridium branch of the phylogenetic tree. on the basis of morphological and physiological properties and phylogenetic analysis, strain 45b(t) represents a novel species, for which the name caloramator boliviensis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is 45b(t) (=dsm 22065(t)=ccug 57396(t)).

TI  == characterization of a microbial consortium capable of degrading lignocellulose.
AB  == a microbial consortium, designated wcs-6, was established by successive subcultivation in the presence of rice straw under static conditions. the degradation efficiencies of wsc-6 for 0.5 g filter paper, cotton and rice straw after 3 days of cultivation were 99.0+/-0.7%, 76.9+/-1.5% and 81.3+/-0.8%, respectively as determined by gravimetrical methods. nine bacterial isolates were obtained from wcs-6 plated under aerobic conditions, and sequencing of their 16s  rdna indicated that these bacteria were related to bacillus thermoamylovorans bta, paenibacillus barengoltzii safn-016, proteobacterium s072, pseudoxanthomonas taiwanensis cb-226, rhizobiaceae str. m100, bacillus sp. e53-10, beta proteobacterium hmd444, petrobacter succinimandens 4bon, and tepidiphilus margaritifer n2-214. dgge (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and sequencing of 16s rdna sequences amplified from total consortium dna revealed the presence of sequences related to those of ureibacillus thermosphaericus, uncultured bacterium clone gc3, uncultured clostridium sp. clone a1-3, clostridium thermobutyricum, and clostridium thermosuccinogenes in addition to the sequences identified from the cultured bacteria. the microbial community identified herein is a potential candidate consortium for the degradation of waste lignocellulosic biomass.

TI  == fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in crude oil contaminated wetland ultisol.
AB  == the effect of crude oil on the growth of legumes (calopogonium muconoides and centrosema pubescens) and fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in wetland ultisol was investigated using standard cultural techniques. the results revealed observable  effects of oil on soil physico-chemistry, plant growth and nodulation as well as  on densities of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic and nitrogen fixing bacteria.  the effects however varied with different levels (0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of pollution. ammonium and nitrate levels were high in the unpolluted soil but decreased with increase in pollution levels. nitrite was not detected in contaminated soil probably due to the reduction in numbers of nitrogen fixers, from 5.26 +/- 0.23 x l0(6)cfu/g in unpolluted soil to 9.0 +/- 0.12 x 10(5) and 2.2 +/- 0.08 x l0(5) cfu/g in soils with 5% and 20% levels of pollution respectively. the contaminated soil also exhibited gross reduction in the nodulation of legumes. a range of 13-57 nodules was observed in legumes from polluted soil against 476 nodules recorded for plants cultured on unpolluted soil. the heterogeneity of the microbial loads between oil-polluted and unpolluted soil were statistically significant (p < 0.05, anova). positive significant relationships were observed between the levels of hydrocarbons and the densities of heterotrophic bacteria (r = 0.91) and that of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (r = 0.86). on the other hand, relationships between the densities of nitrogen fixing bacteria and total hydrocarbons content was negative (r = -0.30) while positive relationships were recorded between the densities of different microbial groups and treatment periods except at 15% and 20% pollution  levels. the lsd tests revealed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in the  physiological groups of soil microorganisms at all levels of pollution. the results imply that crude oil seriously affects rhizosphere microbial growth in legumes. among the bacterial species isolated, clostridium pasteurianum, bacillus polymyxa and pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited greater ability to degrade hydrocarbons than azotobacter sp, klebsiella pneumoniae and derxia gummusa while  nitrosomonas and nitrobacter had the least degradability. a continuous monitoring of the environment is advocated to prevent extinction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and total loss of soil fertility attributable to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the niger delta ultisol.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == global and grain-specific accumulation of glycoside hydrolase family 10 xylanases in transgenic maize (zea mays).
AB  == in planta expression of cell wall degrading enzymes is a promising approach for developing optimized biomass feedstocks that enable low-cost cellulosic biofuels  production. transgenic plants could serve as either an enzyme source for the hydrolysis of pretreated biomass or as the primary biomass feedstock in an autohydrolysis process. in this study, two xylanase genes, bacillus sp. ng-27 bsx and clostridium stercorarium xynb, were expressed in maize (zea mays) under the control of two different promoters. severe phenotypic effects were associated with xylanase accumulation in maize, including stunted plants and sterile grains. global expression of these xylanases from the rice ubiquitin 3 promoter (rubi3) resulted in enzyme accumulation of approximately 0.01 mg enzyme per gram dry weight, or approximately 0.1% of total soluble protein (tsp). grain-specific expression of these enzymes from the rice glutelin 4 promoter (glub-4) resulted in higher-level accumulation of active enzyme, with bsx and xynb accumulating up  to 4.0% tsp and 16.4% tsp, respectively, in shriveled grains from selected t0 plants. these results demonstrate the potential utility of the glub-4 promoter for biotechnological applications. the phenotypic effects of xylanase expression  in maize presented here demonstrate the difficulties of hemicellulase expression  in an important crop for cellulosic biofuels production. potential alternate approaches to achieve xylanase accumulation in planta without the accompanying negative phenotypes are discussed.

TI  == evaluation of methods for preparing hydrogen-producing seed inocula under thermophilic condition by process performance and microbial community analysis.
AB  == five methods for preparation of hydrogen-producing seeds (base, acid, 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid (besa), load-shock and heat shock treatments) as well  as an untreated anaerobic digested sludge were compared for their hydrogen production performance and responsible microbial community structures under thermophilic condition (60 degrees c). the results showed that the load-shock treatment method was the best for enriching thermophilic hydrogen-producing seeds from mixed anaerobic cultures as it completely repressed methanogenic activity and gave the a maximum hydrogen production yield of 1.96 mol h(2) mol(-1) hexose  with an hydrogen production rate of 11.2 mmol h(2) l(-1)h(-1). load-shock and heat-shock treatments resulted in a dominance of thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum with acetic acid and butyric acid type of fermentation while base- and acid-treated seeds were dominated by clostridium sp. and besa-treated seeds were dominated by bacillus sp. the comparative experimental results from hydrogen production performance and microbial community analysis showed that the load-shock treatment method was better than the other four methods for enriching thermophilic hydrogen-producing seeds from anaerobic digested sludge. load-shock treated sludge was implemented in palm oil mill effluent (pome) fermentation and was found to give maximum hydrogen production rates of 13.34 mmol h(2) l(-1)h(-1) and resulted in a dominance of thermoanaerobacterium spp. load-shock treatment is an easy and practical method for enriching thermophilic hydrogen-producing bacteria from anaerobic digested sludge.

TI  == adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  == a wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have  been described with several neonatal infections. we studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. the infections diagnosed included neisseria meningitidies, group a streptococcus, rickettsia rickettsii, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ehrlichia sp., bacillus anthracis, leptospira sp., clostridium sp., klebsiella sp., legionella sp., yersinia pestis, and treponema pallidum. bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with n. meningitidis, four with r. rickettsii, four with s. pneumoniae, three with group a streptococcus, two with s. aureus, two with b. anthracis, one with t. pallidum, and one with legionella sp. bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. although n. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.

TI  == high-level secretion of a chimeric thermostable lichenase from bacillus subtilis  by screening of site-mutated signal peptides with structural alterations.
AB  == a chimeric gene mhg (669 bp) was constructed by substitution of clostridium thermocellum zjl4 lichenase (cg) n-terminal fragment (except its signal sequence) for the counterpart of bacillus sp. a3 lichenase (bg). to acquire high-level secretion of the chimeric lichenase (mhg) in bacillus subtilis, a series of site-mutated signal peptides were designed. the activity of mhg, which was directed by an artificial hydrophobic signal peptide h1 (mmarkiagmatsllvifsssava) from cytoplasm into growth medium, reached 80.56 u/ml after 22-h incubation, indicating that signal peptide hydrophobicity appears to be critical for early stages in mhg export. by purification of the mhg (approximately 25.3 kda) from cultures of b. subtilis (pbsg-h1), enzymatic property assays showed that the common optima for mhg were 70 degrees c and ph 5.0. the residual activity of mhg  at 90 degrees c for 10 min was 83.45% of its maximum activity, which was almost similar to that of cg (90 degrees c, 10 min, 84.33%). this constructed shuttle expression vector with a novel signal peptide exhibited its applicability for high-level production of heterologous proteins from b. subtilis. moreover, the high-level secreted mhg with relatively high thermostability could be a potential candidate for feed industrial applications.

TI  == dominance of endospore-forming bacteria on a rotating activated bacillus contactor biofilm for advanced wastewater treatment.
AB  == the bacterial diversity inherent to the biofilm community structure of a modified rotating biological contactor wastewater treatment process, referred to as the rotating activated bacillus contactor (rabc) process, was characterized in this study, via both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. on the basis of culture-dependent methods, bacillus sp. were found to exist in large numbers on the biofilm (6.5% of the heterotrophic bacteria) and the microbial composition of the biofilms was quite simple. only three phyla were identified-namely, the proteobacteria, the actinobacteria (high g+c gram-positive bacteria), and the firmicutes (low g+c gram-positive bacteria). the culture-independent partial 16s  rdna sequence analysis revealed a considerably more diverse microbial composition within the biofilms. a total of eight phyla were recovered in this case, three of which were major groups: the firmicutes (43.9%), the proteobacteria (28.6%), and  the bacteroidetes (17.6%). the remaining five phyla were minor groups: the planctomycetes (4.4%), the chlorobi (2.2%), the actinobacteria (1.1%), the nitrospirae (1.1%), and the verrucomicrobia (1.1%). the two most abundant genera  detected were the endospore-forming bacteria (31.8%), clostridium and bacillus, both of which are members of the firmicutes phylum. this finding indicates that these endospore-forming bacteria successfully colonized and dominated the rabc process biofilms. many of the colonies or clones recovered from the biofilms evidenced significantly high homology in the 16s rdna sequences of bacteria stored in databases associated with advanced wastewater treatment capabilities, including nitrification and denitrification, phosphorus accumulation, the removal of volatile odors, and the removal of chlorohydrocarbons or heavy metals. the microbial community structures observed in the biofilms were found to correlate nicely with the enhanced performance of advanced wastewater treatment protocols.

TI  == catabacter hongkongensis gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from blood cultures of patients from hong kong and canada.
AB  == four bacterial isolates were recovered from the blood cultures of four patients,  two of whom were from hong kong and two of whom were from canada. the two hong kong strains were isolated from a 48-year-old man with intestinal obstruction and secondary sepsis (strain hku16t) and from a 39-year-old man with acute appendicitis (strain hku17), while the two canadian strains were isolated from a  74-year-old man with biliary sepsis (strain ca1) and from a 66-year-old woman with metastatic carcinoma and sepsis (strain ca2). while the first three patients survived, the last patient died 2 weeks after the episode of bacteremia. all four isolates are strictly anaerobic, nonsporulating, gram-positive coccobacilli that  were unidentified by conventional phenotypic tests and commercial identification  systems. they grow on sheep blood agar as nonhemolytic pinpoint colonies after 48 h of incubation at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic environment. all are catalase positive and motile, with flagella. they produce acid from arabinose, glucose, mannose, and xylose. they do not produce indole or reduce nitrate. they are sensitive to penicillin, vancomycin, and metronidazole but resistant to cefotaxime. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis showed 16.0%, 16.8%, and 21.0% base differences from clostridium propionicum, clostridium neopropionicum, and atopobium minutum, respectively. the g+c content of strain hku16t is 40.2% +/- 2.2%. based on their phylogenetic affiliation, unique g+c content, and phenotypic characteristics, we propose a new genus and species, catabacter hongkongensis gen. nov., sp. nov., to describe the bacterium, for which hku16 is the type strain, and suggest that it be assigned to a new family, catabacteriaceae. the gastrointestinal tract was probably the source of the bacterium for at least three of the four patients. the isolation of a catalase-positive, motile, nonsporulating, anaerobic gram-positive bacillus in clinical laboratories should  raise the possibility of c. hongkongensis. further studies should be performed to ascertain the epidemiology and other disease associations of this bacterium.

TI  == immunohistochemical evidence of clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, and group  a streptococcus in severe soft tissue infections related to injection drug use.
AB  == severe soft tissue infections are caused by either single or multiple microorganisms. we performed a retrospective immunohistochemical (ihc) study on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded soft tissue samples from 20 injection drug users who were part of a cluster of severe illness and death after skin and soft  tissue infections in scotland and ireland in 2000. the ihc assays used antibodies against clostridium sp, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci, and bacillus anthracis. intact bacilli and granular clostridium antigen staining in areas with necrosis, edema, and inflammation were observed in skin, fascia, or muscle samples of 12 (60%) patients. a variety of clostridia were isolated from affected soft tissues in 10 ihc-positive cases. staphylococcus aureus antigens were observed in 3 cases including 1 where s aureus was isolated, 1 with negative cultures, and 1 where mixed cultures were obtained. group a streptococcal antigens were observed in 1 case in which streptococcus pyogenes and s aureus were isolated. by using ihc, we detected different bacteria in archival soft tissue samples from patients with severe skin and soft tissue infections. immunohistochemical assays can be of great diagnostic value, particularly for bacteria such as clostridium sp, which are difficult to isolate because of their  anaerobic fastidious growth requirements.

TI  == essential cysteine residues in bacillus subtilis spore photoproduct lyase identified by alanine scanning mutagenesis.
AB  == endospore-forming bacteria (bacillus and clostridium spp.) are highly ultraviolet (uv) resistant and repair uv-induced dna damage in part using the spore-specific  dna repair enzyme spore photoproduct (sp) lyase. sp lyase in all known sporeformers contains four conserved cysteine residues; three absolutely conserved residues are located at the "radical sam" consensus (c91xxxc95xxc98), which presumably participates in [4fe-4s] cluster formation. a fourth conserved cysteine, the function of which is unknown, is located at c141 in sp lyase from all bacillus spp. sequenced to date. to probe the function of the fourth cysteine, each conserved cysteine in the b. subtilis sp lyase was systematically  altered to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. uv-visible spectroscopy of wild-type and mutant sp lyases indicated that c141 does not participate in [4fe-4s] formation and redox chemistry; however, in vivo sp lyase activity was abolished in all mutants, indicating an essential role for c141 in sp lyase activity.

TI  == shuttleworthia satelles gen. nov., sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  == nine strains of anaerobic, non-spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli, isolated from the human oral cavity and provisionally identified as belonging to the genus eubacterium, were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genetic tests. biochemically, they were found to comprise a homogeneous group, and phylogenetic analysis of their 16s rrna sequences indicated that they constitute  a unique branch within the clostridium-bacillus subphylum of the phylum firmicutes. all of the isolates displayed an unusual colonial morphology after extended incubation. this resembled a contaminated culture in that small, secondary colonies were seen to arise around and from within the primary colony form, and a third, independent, colony type was also seen. however, inspection of the colonies by gram-staining and scanning electron microscopy together with protein profile analysis and 16s rrna gene sequence comparison of the two independent colony types revealed that only a single organism was present. a new  genus, shuttleworthia, and the species shuttleworthia satelles gen. nov., sp. nov., are proposed. the cells are saccharolytic, and acetate, butyrate and lactate are produced as end products of glucose fermentation. aesculin is hydrolysed and indole is produced. the g+c content of the dna of the type strain  is 51 mol%. the type strain is strain dsm 14600t (= ccug 45864t = vpi d143k-13t).

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == caloramator viterbensis sp. nov., a novel thermophilic, glycerol-fermenting bacterium isolated from a hot spring in italy.
AB  == a moderately thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium, strain jw/ms-vs5t, was isolated from a mixed sediment/water sample of a hot spring at bagnaccio (near viterbo, italy). the cells of this organism were straight to slightly curved rods, 0.4-0.6 x 2.03.0 microm in dimension. cells occurred singly and stained gram-positive. the temperature range for growth at ph(25c) 6.0 was 33-64 degrees c, the optimum  being 58 degrees c. the ph(25c) range for growth was from 5.0 to 7.8, the optimum being 6.0-6.5. the substrates utilized included glycerol, glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, sucrose, cellobiose, lactose, starch and yeast extract. acetate and 1,3-propanediol were the only detectable organic products of glycerol fermentation; significant amounts of h2 were produced during growth. the strain was unable to grow autotrophically in the presence of h2 and co2. the main products of glucose fermentation were co2, h2, acetate and ethanol. single amino  acids, including serine, glutamine, threonine, leucine, methionine, aspartate, valine and histidine (but not arginine), served as carbon sources. growth was completely inhibited by ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, rifampicin and kanamycin at 100 microg ml(-1) and was retarded by streptomycin and tetracycline. the g+c content of the dna was 32 mol% (hplc). according to 16s rdna sequence analysis, the isolate is located within the gram-type positive bacillus-clostridium branch of the phylogenetic tree. on the basis of physiological properties and phylogenetic analysis, it is proposed that strain jw/ms-vs5t (the only, and type, strain) (= dsm 13723t = atcc pta 584t), constitutes the new species caloramator viterbensis.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in latin american patients with reactive arthritis by  polymerase chain reaction and sequencing analysis.
AB  == objective: bacteria and/or their antigens are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (rea). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using the 16s ribosomal rna-pcr method was used to identify bacterial dna in synovial fluid (sf) and tissue (st) in a well defined group of patients with chronic rea.  in addition, species found were identified by means of sequence analysis. methods: we examined 15 st and 5 sf samples of 15 patients with rea, 5 st samples of 5 patients with osteoarthritis (oa), and 8 sf from 8 patients with closed traumatic knee injuries using a nested pcr with universal 16s rrna primers. in addition, a nested pcr was developed to detect dna sequences of salmonella sp. and mycoplasma sp. automated sequencing and comparative data analysis (genbank) were also performed to identify the species. results: bacterial dna was identified in 8 cases, 5 st and 3 sf; chlamydia trachomatis (n = 2), pseudomonas  sp. (n = 3), and bacillus cereus (n = 2) were the most common microorganisms identified. a variety of microorganisms including clostridium sp., lactobacillus  sp., pseudomonas migulae, p. fluorescens, and p. putida, and neisseria meningitidis serogroup b were also identified. in half of the cases (4/8) 2 to 3  bacterial antigens were identified simultaneously. conclusion: bacterial dna is present in the joints in patients with chronic rea. a wide spectrum of bacteria including some not previously associated with rea were identified. further studies are needed to establish their exact role in the pathogenesis of rea and related arthritides.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in human tungiasis.
AB  == tungiasis is caused by penetration of the female sand flea tunga penetrans into the epidermis of its host. it is endemic in many countries in latin america, the  caribbean and sub-saharan africa. although superinfection is a common clinical observation, the frequency and the pattern of bacterial pathogens associated with tungiasis have never been investigated systematically. we conducted a prospective clinico-bacteriological study with patients living in a shantytown in fortaleza,  capital of ceara state (northeast brazil), where tungiasis is hyperendemic. swabs were taken from 78 patients with multiple lesions after surgical extraction of the parasite, and the specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. ninety-nine specimens were investigated for aerobic bacteria, from which 146 pathogens were identified. the most common species were staphyloccous aureus (35.5%) and various enterobacteriaceae (29.5%). bacillus sp., enteroccous faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas sp. were also isolated. eighty-four anaerobic cultures yielded 20 pathogens: in eight cases we  detected peptostreptococcus sp., in seven cases clostridium sp., and in five cases non-identifiable gram-negative bacilli. these results show that secondary infection is very common in tungiasis, and caused by a variety of highly pathogenic microorganisms. it is proposed that t. penetrans acts as a foreign body facilitating biofilm formation within the epidermis. to prevent spreading of pathogens to the surrounding tissue and/or the systemic circulation, sand fleas should be surgically extracted immediately after penetration.

TI  == a thermostable collagenolytic protease with a very large molecular mass produced  by thermophilic bacillus sp. strain mo-1.
AB  == a collagenolytic protease was purified to homogeneity from thermophilic bacillus  sp. strain mo-1. the protease from strain mo-1 showed high activity toward type i and iv collagens and gelatin. however, peptide substrates (4-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl-pro-leu-gly-pro-arg and 2-furylacryloyl-leu-gly-pro-ala) for collagenases were inert as substrates. the collagenolytic protease cleaved oxidized insulin b-chain at 11 sites and degraded type i and iv collagens into anonymous small pieces, suggesting that the protease digests collagens at multiple sites. the collagenolytic protease was far more thermostable than a mesophilic clostridium histolyticum collagenase. the collagenolytic protease possesses two salient features: (1) it has a very large molecular mass, 210 kda, and consists of two, identical 105-kda subunits; (2) it  belongs to a serine protease group. the high molecular mass is unique among serine proteases but common for collagenases. the features of the enzyme from strain mo-1 suggest that it is a new collagenolytic protease which is distinct from previously reported collagenases and serine proteases.

TI  == comparative genomics and evolution of genes encoding bacterial (p)ppgpp synthetases/hydrolases (the rel, rela and spot proteins).
AB  == in the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli, the effector molecule of the stringent response, (p)ppgpp, is synthesized by two different enzymes, rela and spot, whereas in the gram-positive model organism bacillus subtilis only one  enzyme named rel is responsible for this activity. rel and spot also possess (p)ppgpp hydrolase activity. blast searches were used to identify orthologous genes in databases. the construction and bootstrapping of phylogenetic trees allowed classification of these orthologs. four groups could be distinguished: with the exception of neisseria and bordetella (beta subdivision), the rela and spot groups are exclusively found in the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria. two rel groups representing the actinobacterial and the bacillus/clostridium group were also identified. the spot proteins are related to the gram positive rel proteins. rela proteins carry substitutions in the hd domain (aravind and koonin, 1998, tibs 23: 469-472) responsible for ppgpp degradation. a theory for the evolution of the specialized, paralogous rela and spot genes is presented: after  gene duplication of an ancestral rellike gene, the spot and rela genes evolved from the duplicated genes. the distribution pattern of the paralogous rela and spot proteins supports a new model of linear bacterial evolution (gupta, 2000, fems microbiol. rev. 24: 367-402). this model postulates that the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria represents the most recently evolved bacterial lineage. however, two paralogous, closely related genes of porphyromonas gingivalis (cytophaga-flavobacterium-bacteroides phylum) encoding proteins with functions probably identical to the rela and spot proteins do not fit in this model. completely sequenced genomes of several obligately parasitic organisms (treponema pallidum, chlamydia species, rickettsia prowazekii) and the obligate aphid symbiont buchnera sp. aps as well as archaea do not contain rel-like genes  but they are present in the arabidopsis genome. in crosslinking experiments using different analogs of ppgpp as crosslinking reagents and rna polymerase preparations of escherichia coli, binding of ppgpp to distinct regions at the c-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpob gene product) and/or at the n-terminus of the beta subunit (the rpoc gene product) was observed previously. rpob and rpoc sequences of the species which do not possess a rel like gene do not exhibit specific insertions or deletions in the ppgpp binding regions.

TI  == expression of bacterial beta-glucuronidase in human bile: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: bacterial beta-glucuronidase causes deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide resulting in the precipitation of calcium bilirubinate, which contributes to biliary sludge and stone formation. this process is attributed to  enzyme activity produced by the aerobic enterobacteriaceae such as escherichia coli and klebsiella sp. the presence of clostridium sp. was detected in 48 of 56  intrahepatic stones by using polymerase chain reaction techniques and cultured clostridium perfringens from 14 of 18 unblocked biliary stents. such bacteria are reported to produce beta-glucuronidase activity. the aim of this study was to determine the proportion of biliary bacteria isolated from pigment stones and stents that produce beta-glucuronidase and to compare the enzyme activity expressed by the different bacteria in human bile. methods: a total of 202 bacteria were isolated from blocked and unblocked biliary stents and pigment ductal stones recovered from patients. of these, 61 bacteria expressed beta-glucuronidase activity in brain heart infusion broth. these 61 bacteria were subsequently grown in human bile under aerobic or anaerobic conditions to the early stationary phase and assayed for beta-glucuronidase activity by using rho-nitrophenyl beta-d glucuronide as substrate. results were normalized and reported as units of enzyme activity per milligram protein of the bacteria. results: c. perfringens produced beta-glucuronidase enzyme activity that was 34-fold higher than that for e coli, staphylococcus, corynebacterium sp., bacillus sp., enterococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., streptococcus sp., and klebsiella sp. conclusion: c. perfringens with its higher enzyme activity is more important in the deconjugation of bilirubin diglucuronide than e coli and klebsiella sp.

AB  == sucrose laurates, sucrose palmitate, sucrose stearates, and monolaurin (lauricidin) were evaluated for inhibitory effects against spores of bacillus sp., clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and alicyclobacillus sp. in a model agar system. the combined treatment of sucrose laurate, high hydrostatic pressure, and mild heat was evaluated on spores of bacillus and alicyclobacillus in foods. the  minimum inhibitory concentrations of the sucrose esters were higher than that of  lauricidin for all spores tested in the model agar system, but lauricidin was not the most readily suspended in the test media. the sucrose laurates and sucrose palmitate were more effective and more readily suspended than the sucrose stearates. a combined treatment of sucrose laurate (<1.0%), 392 megapascals (mpa) at 45 degrees c for 10 to 15 min provided 3- to 5.5-log10 cfu/ml reductions from  initial populations of 10(6) cfu/ml for bacillus subtilis 168 in milk, bacillus cereus 14579 in beef, bacillus coagulans 7050 in tomato juice (ph 4.5), alicyclobacillus sp. n1089 in tomato juice (ph 4.5), and alicyclobacillus sp. n1098 in apple juice. the most notable change in the appearance of the products was temporary foaming during mixing of the sucrose laurate in the foods. the effect of sucrose laurate appeared to be inhibitory rather than lethal to the spores. the inhibitory effects observed on bacillus and alicyclobacillus spores by the combined treatment of pressure, mild heat, and sucrose laurate appear promising for food applications where alternatives to high heat processing are desired.

TI  == the role of probiotic cultures in the control of gastrointestinal health.
AB  == the use of probiotics to enhance intestinal health has been proposed for many years. probiotics are traditionally defined as viable microorganisms that have a  beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of specific pathologic conditions when they are ingested. there is a relatively large volume of literature that supports the use of probiotics to prevent or treat intestinal disorders. however, the scientific basis of probiotic use has been firmly established only recently, and sound clinical studies have begun to be published. currently, the best-studied probiotics are the lactic acid bacteria, particularly lactobacillus sp. and bifidobacterium sp. however, other organisms used as probiotics in humans include escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., enterococcus sp., bacteroides sp., bacillus sp., propionibacterium sp. and various fungi. some probiotic preparations contain mixtures of more than one bacterial strain. probiotics have been examined for their effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal disorders such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea (including clostridium difficile-associated intestinal disease), infectious bacterial and viral diarrhea (including diarrhea  caused by rotavirus, shigella, salmonella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, vibrio cholerae and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency disorder, enteral feeding diarrhea, helicobacter pylori gastroenteritis, sucrase maltase deficiency, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and lactose intolerance. probiotics have been found to inhibit intestinal bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of colonic carcinogens. there are many mechanisms by which probiotics enhance intestinal health, including stimulation of immunity, competition for limited nutrients, inhibition of epithelial and mucosal adherence, inhibition of epithelial invasion and production of antimicrobial substances. probiotics represent an exciting prophylactic and therapeutic advance, although additional investigations must be  undertaken before their role in intestinal health can be delineated clearly.

TI  == [development from actions of bacterial phospholipases c on eucaryotic plasma membranes to molecular biology of gpi-anchored proteins].
AB  == bacterial phospholipases c are known to act on biomembranes, since they can cleave the phosphodiester linkage between the polar head and the hydrophobic moiety of each phospholipid in these membranes. these enzymes have been classified into three groups; phosphatidylcholine (pc)-, sphingomyelin (sm)- and  phosphatidylinositol (pi)-degrading phospholipases c. enzymatic properties and toxicities of these phospholipases c are reviewed, in relation to author's research. studies on the hemolytic phospholipases of clostridium sp., bacillus cereus etc., revealed that hydrolysis of choline-containing phospholipids such as pc and sm was responsible for the hemolysis of mammalian erythrocytes by these enzymes in the presence of ca2+ and/or mg2+. also, the studies on a structure-activity correlation of sm-hydrolyzing phospholipase c from b. cereus disclosed the similarity of active sites between this enzyme and bovine pancreatic dnase i. by action of pi-degrading phospholipases c, several membrane  proteins such as alkaline phosphatase, 5'-nucleotidase, vsg (protozoal surface glycoprotein) etc., were shown to be released from the plasma membranes of eucaryotic cells. from structural analysis, these proteins have been revealed to  be glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins bound to the plasma membranes with carboxyl terminal-attached glycolipid. biochemistry and molecular  biology of gpi-anchored proteins, including the structures and biosynthetic routes of gpi glycolipids as well as the process of gpi attachment to proteins, requirements of c-terminal signal peptide for the protein modification by gpi, and distribution of gpi-anchored proteins in living world, are described in relation to our studies.

AB  == a novel extremely thermophilic bacterium was isolated from the world's deepest sea-floor, the mariana trench challenger deep at a depth of 10,897 m. cells were  gram-reaction variable, non-spore-forming and non-motile rods without flagella. growth was observed between 50 and 80 degrees c (optimum: 74-76 degrees c; 90 min doubling time), ph 5.4 and 9.5 (optimum: ph 7.0-7.5) and 0.5 and 5% sea salts (optimum: 2% sea salts). the isolate was a strictly aerobic heterotroph capable of utilizing as sole energy and carbon source: yeast extract, peptone, cellulose, starch, chitin, casein, casamino acids, a variety of sugars, carboxylic acids and amino acids. the g + c content of the genomic dna was 72.5 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna sequences placed this aerobic, high-g + c-content bacterium among the members of the gram-positive, low-g + c-content anaerobic thermophilic bacteria within the bacillus-clostridium subphylum. on the basis of  the physiological and molecular properties of the new isolate, the name thermaerobacter marianensis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain 7p75at = jcm 10246t) is proposed.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic studies indicate the existence of a cell shape preserving cytoskeleton in prokaryotes.
AB  == immunoelectron microscopic studies of prokaryotes were performed with anti-actin  antibodies directed against the c terminus of actin. studies on ultrathin sections revealed high proportions of the overall label close to the cell periphery in escherichia coli, ralstonia eutropha, thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes, t. thermosaccharolyticum, and methanococcus jannaschii. substantial label also in the cytoplasm was observed in bacillus sp., methanococcus voltae, and methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. only very minor amounts of label were found in the nucleoid region of the cells. whole-mount immunogold studies, combined with negative staining, revealed the existence of an intracellular network of fibrils which could be labeled by anti-actin antibodies. this network is assumed to be located below the cytoplasmic membrane all around the cytoplasm. it appears to have properties that would allow its function as a cytoskeleton-like structure preserving cell shape.

TI  == isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of lactobacillus acidophilus lf221.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the  antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology  was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.

TI  == isolation of a beta-galactosidase-encoding gene from bacillus licheniformis: purification and characterization of the recombinant enzyme expressed in escherichia coli.
AB  == the bacillus licheniformis beta-galactosidase gene, lacbl, was cloned on a 5.8-kb hindiii fragment into pbr322 and expressed by its own promoter in escherichia coli. deletion and complementation analysis showed that the enzyme-encoding region was located on a 4. 1-kb hindiii-clai fragment. the transcription region for the lacbl was identified on this fragment with promoter- and terminator-probe plasmids. the deduced sequence of 149 aa of the n-terminal part of lacbl showed aa sequence homology with beta-gal from b. stearothermophilus, b. circulans, haloferax alicantei, clostridium perfringens, arthrobacter sp.. no significant homology was shared with those found in the lacz and lacs families. the recombinant beta-galactosidase (lacb1) was purified by fplc. the molecular mass of the enzyme (80 kda) and its optimal ph (5.7) and temperature (45 degrees c) were determined.

TI  == studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  == the specific growth rates of brochothrix thermosphacta, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the food micromodel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a  td, r = specific growth rate; t = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). the exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. a microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. the d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. the temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for b. thermosphacta and y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as b. cereus, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and s. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the  d-value of c. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. the values of parameter a of  the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. for all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. the lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. the change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. the influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in  chinese sausages. the d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from mrs cultures was 2.36. in refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. in this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.

TI  == isolation of nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants of nitroreductase-producing clostridium sp. strains from the human intestinal tract.
AB  == five spontaneous nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants (one each of clostridium leptum, clostridium paraputrificum, two other clostridium spp. strains from the human intestinal microflora, and clostridium perfringens atcc 3626) were selected by growth on a nitrofurantoin-containing medium. all of the clostridium wild-type and mutant strains produced nitroreductase, as was shown by the conversion of 4-nitrobenzoic acid to 4-aminobenzoic acid. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) analysis of the mutants during incubation with 50 microg of nitrofurantoin per ml showed the gradual disappearance of the nitrofurantoin peak. the nitrofurantoin peak also disappeared when cell-free supernatants instead of cultures of each of the resistant and wild-type bacteria were used, but it persisted if the cell-free supernatants had been inactivated by heat. at least two of the mutants converted nitrofurantoin to metabolites without antibacterial activity, as was shown by a bioassay with a nitrofurantoin-susceptible bacillus sp. strain. nitrofurantoin at a high concentration (50 microg/ml) continued to exert some toxicity, even on the resistant strains, as was evident from the longer lag phases. this study indicates that clostridium strains can develop resistance to nitrofurantoin while retaining the ability to produce nitroreductase; the mutants metabolized nitrofurantoin to compounds without antibacterial activity.

TI  == new aerobic ammonium-dependent obligately oxalotrophic bacteria: description of ammoniphilus oxalaticus gen. nov., sp. nov. and ammoniphilus oxalivorans gen. nov., sp. nov.
AB  == the genus ammoniphilus is proposed for aerobic endospore-forming gram-variable rod-shaped bacteria, which are ammonium-dependent, obligately oxalotrophic and haloalkalitolerant, oxidase- and catalase-positive, mesophilic and motile by peritrichous flagella. cell wall contained two electron-dense layers. the external layer consists of a chain of electron-dense granules morphologically resembling the cellulosomes of clostridium thermocellum. two species are described, ammoniphilus oxalaticus gen. nov., sp. nov. and ammoniphilus oxalivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strains of these species are strains raox-1 (= dsm 11538) and raox-fs (= dsm 11537), respectively. ammoniphilus strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of sorrel (rumex acetosa) and from decaying wood. the strains require a high concentration of ammonium ions and use  oxalate as the sole organic source of carbon and energy for growth; no growth factors were required. growth occurred at ph 6.8-9.5. the optimum temperature and ph for growth were 28-30 degrees c and 8.0-8.5. all strains grew in a saturated solution of ammonium oxalate, and tolerated 3% nacl. whole-cell hydrolysates contain meso-diaminopimelic acid and glucose. the menaquinone of the strains was  mk 7, and the major cellular fatty acids were 12-methyl tetradecanoic, cis-hexadec-9-enoic and hexadecanoic acids. the g + c content of the dna was 45-46 mol% for a. oxalaticus and 42 mol% for a. oxalivorans. the almost complete  16s rdna sequence of three strains of the two species of ammoniphilus shows that  the genus falls into the radiation of the clostridium-bacillus subphylum of gram-positive bacteria. the closest phylogenetic neighbour of ammoniphilus is oxalophagus oxalicus. the dna-dna hybridization value between strains raox-1 and  raox-fs was 39.7%.

TI  == amino acid sequence and stereoselective hydrolytic reaction of an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase from a bacillus strain.
AB  == bacillus sp. ksm-522 produces three different extracellular endo-1,4-beta-glucanases [egs; okoshi et al., agric. biol. chem., 54, 83-89 (1990)]. here, we report the molecular cloning and sequencing of the gene for the fourth eg (eg-iv) of the organism and the mechanism of its hydrolytic reaction. the structural gene contained an open reading frame of 1911 bp, corresponding to  636 amino acids, the amino acid sequence of which was very close to that of an eg of clostridium cellulovorans, belonging to the cellulase family e2. the molecular mass of the extracellular mature enzyme (ser26 through lys636) was calculated to  be 69,076 da, a value close to the 69.2 kda measured for the recombinant eg-iv expressed in bacillus subtilis. the optimum ph and temperature for activity of the recombinant enzyme were ph 8.0 and 50 degrees c, respectively. by 1h-nmr spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl beta-d-cellotrioside by eg-iv proceeded with inversion of the anomeric configuration.

AB  == a thermophilic, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium (strain jw/as-y6t) was isolated from a mixed sediment-water sample from a hot spring (calcite spring area) at yellowstone national park. the vegetative cells of this organism were straight rods, 0.4 to 0.6 by 3.0 to 6.5 microns. cells occurred singly and exhibited a slight tumbling motility. they formed round refractile endospores in  terminal swollen sporangia. cells stained gram positive. the temperature range for growth at ph 6.8 was 43 to 65 degrees c, with optimum growth at 58 degrees c. the range for growth at 60 degrees c (ph60c; with the ph meter calibrated at 60 degrees c) was 5.9 to 7.8, with an optimum ph60c of 6.3 to 6.5. the substrates utilized included glycerol, glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, xylose, lactate, glycerate, pyruvate, and yeast extract. in the presence of co2, acetate  was the only organic product from glycerol and carbohydrate fermentation. no h2 was produced during growth. the strain was not able to grow chemolithotrophically at the expense of h2-co2; however, suspensions of cells in the exponential growth phase consumed h2. the bacterium reduced fumarate to succinate and thiosulfate to elemental sulfur. growth was inhibited by ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, rifampin, and tetracycline, but not by streptomycin. the g+c content of the dna was 54.5 mol% (as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography). the 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis placed the isolate in the gram type-positive bacillus-clostridium subphylum. on the basis of physiological properties and phylogenetic analysis we propose that the isolated strain constitutes a new species, moorella glycerini; the type strain is jw/as-y6 (= dsm 11254 = atcc 700316).

(type strain jw/as-y7t; dsm 11255), was isolated from hot springs in yellowstone national park and new zealand. the gram-positive-staining cells occurred singly or in pairs as straight to slightly curved rods, 0.3 to 0.4 by 1.6 to 2.7 microns, with rounded ends and  exhibited a tumbling motility. spores were not observed. the temperature range for growth was 50 to 74 degrees c with an optimum at 65 degrees c. the ph range for growth at 65 degrees c was from 5.5 to 7.6, with an optimum at 6.0 to 6.2. the organism coupled the oxidation of glycerol to reduction of amorphous fe(iii)  oxide or fe(iii) citrate as an electron acceptor. in the presence as well as in the absence of fe(iii) and in the presence of co2, glycerol was metabolized by incomplete oxidation to acetate as the only organic metabolic product; no h2 was  produced during growth. the organism utilized glycerol, lactate, 1,2-propanediol, glycerate, pyruvate, glucose, fructose, mannose, and yeast extract as substrates. in the presence of fe(iii) the bacterium utilized molecular hydrogen. the organism reduced 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonic acid, fumarate (to succinate), and thiosulfate (to elemental sulfur) but did not reduce mno2, nitrate, sulfate,  sulfite, or elemental sulfur. the g + c content of the dna was 41 mol% (as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography). the 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis placed the isolated strain as a member of a new genus within the gram-type-positive bacillus-clostridium subphylum.

AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

TI  == acetogenesis from dichloromethane by a two-component mixed culture comprising a novel bacterium.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic two-component culture able to grow exponentially with a doubling time of 20 h on a medium containing dichloromethane as the carbon and energy source was characterized. on a medium without sulfate, we observed (per mol of dichloromethane) a mass balance of 2 mol of chloride, 0.26 mol of acetate, 0.05 mol of formate, and 0.25 mol of carbon in biomass. one component of the culture, strain dmb, was identified by a 16s ribosomal dna analysis as a desulfovibrio sp. the other component, the gram-positive organism strain dmc, could not be isolated. it was possible, however, to associate strain dmc on a medium containing dichloromethane in a coculture with acetobacterium woodii or methanospirillum hungatei. coculture of strain dmc with the archaeon m. hungatei  allowed us to specifically amplify by pcr the 16s rrna gene of strain dmc. a phylogenetic analysis of the 16s ribosomal dna sequence revealed that this organism groups within the radiation of the clostridium-bacillus subphylum and exhibits the highest levels of sequence similarity (89%) with desulfotomaculum orientis and desulfitobacterium dehalogenans. since the novel organism strain dmc was able to grow acetogenically with dichloromethane when it was associated with  one of three metabolically different partners and since, in contrast to strain dmb, strain dmc contained carbon monoxide dehydrogenase activity, this bacterium  is responsible for both the dehalogenation of dichloromethane and the acetogenesis observed in the original two-component culture. the obligatory dependence of strain dmc on a partner during growth with dichloromethane is thought to stem from the need for a growth factor produced by the associated organism.

AB  == cell walls from various gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. after renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) triton x-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. one to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls  incorporated into gels. crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various gram-positive bacteria such as clostridium perfringens (15 bands), micrococcus luteus (1 band), bacillus megaterium (4 bands), bacillus sp. (6 bands), b. cereus (3 bands), b. subtilis (7 bands), staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and strep. pyogenes (5 bands). molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kda. lytic activities against cell walls of corynebacterium sepedonicum (clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of strep. pyogenes (45.7 kda), strep. faecalis (67 kda), b. megaterium (67 kda), and staph. aureus (67 kda).

TI  == some factors affecting isolation of clostridium tetani from human and animal stools.
AB  == clostridium tetani was isolated from human and animal stools at the following rates [95% confidence interval (ci)]: human, 0% (1.5-0); horse, 1% (5-0); cow in  cowshed, 4% (10-1); cow in pasture, 8.3% (17-1), calf in pasture, 0% (7-0); dog,  2% (11-0) and sheep in pasture, 25% (44-14). quantification of c. tetani in 16 animal stools positive for the bacillus was impossible in most cases, as the number of tetanus bacilli present was not large enough for this purpose. contaminating anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in human and animal stools, i.e., c. perfringens and streptococcus sp., group g, inhibited isolation  of c. tetani from these materials, particularly at the step of isolation employing its swarming character.

TI  == heterologous hybridization of bacterial dna to the endoglucanases a and b structural genes cela and celb of clostridium thermocellum.
AB  == dna from various cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic bacteria was found to hybridize to clostridium thermocellum ncib10682 dna fragments carrying the structural genes cela and celb which code for endoglucanases a and b. homology to cela was detected in agrobacterium rhizogenes, azospirillum brasilense, bacillus  subtilis, cellulomonas sp., clostridium stercorarium, erwinia chrysanthemi, pseudomonas solanacearum and streptomyces griseus. homology to celb was detected  only in b. subtilis, c. stercorarium and e. chrysanthemi. no homology to cela or  celb was detected in agrobacterium tumefaciens, rhizobium japonicum, rhizobium meliloti, rhizobium ors571 and trichoderma reesei. hybridization performed with the homologous strain ncib10682 and with c. thermocellum lqri suggested that the  two strains were identical in terms of cel genes. in addition, it is likely that  the c. thermocellum cel genes, whose number is presently estimated to be at least ten, do not belong to a gene family, since heterologous hybridization was observed only to a single small ecori or hindiii fragment homologous to celb.

TI  == nitrous oxide production by organisms other than nitrifiers or denitrifiers.
AB  == heterotrophic bacteria, yeasts, fungi, plants, and animal breath were investigated as possible sources of n(2)o. microbes found to produce n(2)o from no(3) but not consume it were: (i) all of the nitrate-respiring bacteria examined, including strains of escherichia, serratia, klebsiella, enterobacter, erwinia, and bacillus; (ii) one of the assimilatory nitrate-reducing bacteria examined, azotobacter vinelandii, but not azotobacter macrocytogenes or acinetobacter sp.; and (iii) some but not all of the assimilatory nitrate-reducing yeasts and fungi, including strains of hansenula, rhodotorula, aspergillus, alternaria, and fusarium. the no(3)-reducing obligate anaerobe clostridium kdhs2 did not produce n(2)o. production of n(2)o occurred only in stationary phase. the nitrate-respiring bacteria produced much more n(2)o than the other organisms, with yields of n(2)o ranging from 3 to 36% of 3.5 mm no(3).  production of n(2)o was apparently not regulated by ammonium and was not restricted to aerobic or anaerobic conditions. plants do not appear to produce n(2)o, although n(2)o was found to arise from some damaged plant tops, probably due to microbial growth. concentrations of n(2)o above the ambient level in the atmosphere were found in human breath and appeared to increase after a meal of high-nitrate food.

TI  == biosynthesis of vitamin b12. different pathways in some aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.
AB  == radioactivity from [1'-14c]riboflavin was incorporated into the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety of vitamin b12 in the aerobes bacillus megaterium, nocardia rugosa and streptomyces sp. as well as in the aerotolerant anaerobe propionibacterium freudenreichii, but not in the anaerobe eubacterium limosum. as recently published for e. limosum, also in the anaerobe clostridium barkeri radioactivity from [1-14c]glycine and [2-14c]glycine was found in the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety, but not in the corrin moiety. the addition of l-[methyl-14c]methionine to c. barkeri led to the labeling of the corrin moiety and the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety, showing that the seven "extra" methyl groups in the corrin ring as well as the two methyl groups of the base part originate from this precursor. in clostridium thermoaceticum, forming the vitamin b12 analog 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide, [1-14c]glycine and [2-14c]glycine were also incorporated into the 5-methoxybenzimidazole moiety, but not into the corrin ring. in e. limosum l-[u-14c]glutamate led to the labeling of the corrin ring of vitamin b12, but not of its base moiety. these results together with data from the literature indicate that a common biosynthetic pathway might exist for the corrinoid biosynthesis in aerobic microorganisms, and in those aerotolerant anaerobes like the propionibacteria, which form the 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole moiety of vitamin b12 only under aerobic conditions. they also show that this pathway differs from the pathway found in anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == the gradostat: a bidirectional compound chemostat and its application in microbiological research.
AB  == a multistage continuous culture system is described in which solutes are transferred between vessels in opposite directions simultaneously. the system, called a gradostat, produces opposing solute gradients and is a good laboratory model of many natural microbial ecosystems in which solute gradients are important. theoretical predictions concerning solute transfer were confirmed under steady-state and non steady-state conditions, using a coloured dye. paracoccus denitrificans grew anaerobically in the gradostat at the intersection  between opposing gradients of succinate and nitrate. opposing gradients of glucose and oxygen separated the growth of a bacillus sp. (a facultative anaerobe) and clostridium butyricum (an obligate anaerobe). viable counts for both species fell exponentially away from their growth positions at the ends of the gradostat. the potential value of the gradostat and possible alternative conformations are discussed.

TI  == pectinase activity of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria associated with soft rot of yam (diascorea rotundata).
AB  == anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria associated with soft rot of yam (diascorea rotundata) were isolated by the looping-out method and found to consist of clostridium (three isolates), corynebacterium (three isolates), vibrio (one isolate), and bacillus lentus (one isolate). enzyme assay for hydrolase, lyase, and pectinesterase activities by the cup-plate method showed that except for vibrio sp., b. lentus, and two isolates of corynebacterium no pectinase activity could be detected for organisms cultured on pectin medium. most of the cultures on yam tissue, however, showed activities for the three enzymes. the viscometric assay for hydrolase and lyase enzymes indicated a significant level of hydrolase activity (a 40.90% decrease in viscosity for vibrio sp. and corynebacterium spp.), but no lyase activity for most of the isolates. two isolates of corynebacterium and b. lentus caused changes in fresh yams suggestive of soft rot.

TI  == dinitrogen-fixing bacteria: computer-assisted identification of soil isolates.
AB  == dinitrogen-fixing (acetylene-reducing) bacteria may be readily isolated from soils but extensive biochemical or immunobiological testing, or both, are required to identify them absolutely. a computer-assisted scheme for identification of nine genera of dinitrogen-fixing bacteria was developed and tested. the computer program is based on interpretation of the 70 biochemical tests of the api 20e and 50e, supplemented with tests for acetylene reduction, nitrate and nitrite reduction, catalase, oxidase, motility, and growth on macconkey's bile salt medium. dinitrogen-fixing enterobacteriaceae (klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and erwinia herbicola) were accurately identified using the data base in the api analytical profile index. nonenteric dinitrogen-fixing bacteria (azotobacter spp., azospirillum spp., derxia sp., rhodospirillum sp., clostridium sp., and bacillus spp.) were subjected to these tests to form a new data base for these bacteria. the api tests agreed with standard biochemical tests commonly used to identify these bacteria, were reproducible with time, and were sufficiently unique to permit accurate identification of each species. the use of the api 20e and 50e tests plus the additional seven tests with these known data bases permitted rapid and precise identification of acetylene reducing bacteria from various agricultural ecosystems.

TI  == microbial activity of trench leachates from shallow-land, low-level radioactive waste disposal sites.
AB  == trench leachate samples collected anoxically from shallow-land, low-level radioactive waste disposal sites were analyzed for total aerobic and anaerobic populations, sulfate reducers, denitrifiers, and methanogens. among the several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated, only bacillus sp., pseudomonas sp., citrobacter sp., and clostridium sp. were identified. mixed bacterial cultures isolated from the trench leachates were able to grow anaerobically in trench leachates, which indicates that the radionuclides and organic chemicals present were not toxic to these bacteria. changes in concentrations of several of the organic constituents of the waste leachate samples were observed due to anaerobic microbial activity. growth of a mixed culture of trench-water bacteria in media containing a mixture of radionuclides, 60co, 85sr, and 134,137cs, was not affected at total activity concentrations of 2.6 x 10(2) and 2.7 x 10(3) pci/ml.

TI  == controlled cell disruption: a comparison of the forces required to disrupt different micro-organisms.
AB  == a cell disrupter has been developed which can measure the forces required to disrupt both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. it operates a continuous process and will disrupt both large and small volumes. shear forces are set up when a suspension under laminar flow conditions is released under high pressure through  a short orifice. if the applied pressure is altered, the shear forces are simultaneously changed so that the amount of cell disruption can be compared under different known and repeatable conditions. the disrupter is now manufactured and supplied by stansted fluid power limited, stansted, england. phase-contrast microscopy has shown that the disrupter will break a variety of organisms including chlorella, aspergillus fumigatis, fusarium sp., saccharomyces cerevisiae, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus zooepidermicus and staphylococcus aureus. the cells are not all broken at one pressure but a certain pressure must be applied before disruption starts which will then increase rapidly as the applied pressure is increased. the applied pressure required to disrupt half the population in a culture is different from one species to another, rods being disrupted more easily than spheres. the case of disruption seems to be related to the shape and chemical composition of the cell wall. furthermore, the disrupting process, in an unsynchronized culture is not random and may be related to the statistical size distribution of the cells.

TI  == production of an antibiotic substance by bacillus licheniformis within the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == in monoxenic mice, vegetative cells and spores of bacillus licheniformis were enumerated and in vivo antibiotic production was measured at various levels of the digestive tract and in the feces. the apparent independence of vegetative cell and spore populations in the cecum and feces, as well as the marked fluctuations of these two populations in the stomach and small intestine, suggested that sporulation of b. licheniformis and production of antibiotic occur only in the upper levels of the digestive tract. study of dixenic models wherein  b. licheniformis was inoculated after clostridium perfringens or lactobacillus sp. or before lactobacillus sp. revealed the simultaneous disappearance of b. licheniformis from the stomach and antibiotic from the feces. this strain persisted in the cecum, but only in the form of vegetative cells. these models demonstrate that the activity of the microflora in the upper segments can affect  the equilibrium of the microflora throughout the digestive tract.

TI  == a special report: four-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency maintained in strict reverse isolation from birth.
AB  == a 4-year study of a boy with combined immune deficiency is presented, and the impact of this disease on various aspects of his growth and development is examined. there is no evidence of immune deficiency in either parent or in the genetic background on the maternal side. three children of a brother of the mother's father may have had immune deficiencies but two have grown to be teenagers with no problems. another died. at autopsy, however, lymph nodes appeared normal. the deceased older brother had severe combined immune deficiency (scid). the autopsy findings showed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia to be the direct cause of death and these findings contributed to the diagnosis of scid. after a successful germ-free birth, the male infant (dv) was placed in the isolator. laboratory tests were normal except that the x-rays showed no thymic shadow, his absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 399-440/mm and the lymphocytes  showed no proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (pha). specific tests showed the antibody-producing immune system and the cell-mediated immune system to be severely defective. the patient's lymphocytes elicited positive responses by lymphocytes from father, mother, and sister. subsequent search in national and international tissue-typing laboratories has shown four hla matches but none has  been nonreactive in mixed lymphocyte culture (mlc). therefore, this patient has remained in isolation to the present; now he is 4 years old. approximately 35 species of microorganisms, mostly transient contaminants, have been isolated, taking into account that the same organism may have been identified under different names in different laboratories. those isolated frequently and in sufficiently high concentration to indicate colonization have been speciated as follows: anaerobes-propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus catenaforme (disappeared spontaneously), bacteroides oralis ss. elongatus, clostridium (perenne, hastiforme, bifermentans), bacteroides clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis; aerobes-alcaligenes faecalis (eradicated by antibiotics), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter agglomerans, microcossu sp. subgroup 1,  bacillus pulvifaciens (disappeared spontaneously); yeasts-candida (tropicalis, parapsilosis). seven are considered to be probable components of the current autoflora: p. acnes, c. bifermentans, b. clostridiiformis ss. clostridiiformis, s. epidermidis, micrococcus sp. subgroup 1, e. agglomerans, c. parapsilosis. no viruses or protozoa have been isolated. at age 3 years, the mean quantitation of  anaerobic cells was 7.9 x 10(7) viable cells/g feces; this falls short of the mean anaerobic load from normal children. the mean aerobic concentration was 1.2  x 10(8) viable cells/g feces, not unlike normal children. qualitatively his flora has abnormally few species and lacks those most common in normal subjects. this child has had no evidence of infection and has always been in excellent health even though some organisms which could be pathogenic under some circumstances have been isolated...

AB  == we have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "l.n.", reared in a plastic isolator. eight bacterial strains were studied. seven had been fortuitously introduced: acinetobacter lwoffi ln1, staphylococcus epidermidis ln2, clostridium perfringens ln3, plectridium anatum ln4, streptococcus bovis ln5, enterobacter cloacae ln6, corynebacterium sp ln7. the eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. this strain is bacillus licheniformis fd1. the gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child l.n. in addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of b. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.

AB  == the sporicidal properties of hydrogen peroxide were evaluated at concentrations of 10 to 41% and at temperatures of 24 to 76 c. the organisms tested and their relative resistance at 24 c to 25.8% h(2)o(2) were: bacillus subtilis sa 22 > b.  subtilis var. globigii > b. coagulans > b. stearothermophilus > clostridium sp. putrefactive anaerobe 3679 > s. aureus, with "d" values of 7.3, 2, 1.8, 1.5, 0.8., and 0.2 min, respectively. heat shocking spores prior to hydrogen peroxide  treatment decreased their resistance. wet spores were more resistant than dry spores when good mixing was achieved during hydrogen peroxide treatment. inactivation curves followed first-order kinetics except for a lag period where the inactivation rate was very slow. increasing the h(2)o(2) concentration and the temperature reduced the lag period.
