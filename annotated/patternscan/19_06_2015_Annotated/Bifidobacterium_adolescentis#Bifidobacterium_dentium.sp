TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of fecal bifidobacterium species in centenarians living in bama, guangxi, china.
AB  == centenarians constitute a significant subpopulation in the bama county of guangxi province in china. the beneficial effects of intestinal microbiota, especially bifidobacteria of centenarians, have been widely accepted; however, knowledge about bifidobacterium species in centenarians is not adequate. the aim of this study was to investigate the quantity and prevalence of fecal bifidobacterium in  healthy longevous individuals. fecal samples from eight centenarians from bama (aged 100 to 108 years), eight younger elderlies from bama (aged 80 to 99 years), and eight younger elderlies from nanning (aged 80 to 99 years) were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, species-specific clone library, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology (qpcr). a total of eight different bifidobacterium species were detected. b. dentium, b. longum, b. thermophilum, b. pseudocatenulatum/b. catenulatum, and b. adolescentis were common in fecal of centenarians and young elderly. b. minimum, b. saecularmay/b.  pullorum/b. gallinarum, and b. mongoliense were found in centenarians but were absent in the younger elderlies. in addition, bifidobacterium species found in centenarians were different from those found in bama young elderly and nanning young elderly, and the principal differences were the significant increase in the population of b. longum (p < 0.05) and b. dentium (p < 0.05) and the reduction in the frequency of b. adolescentis (p < 0.05), respectively. centenarians tend to have more complex fecal bifidobacterium species than young elderlies from different regions.

TI  == predicting fecal sources in waters with diverse pollution loads using general and molecular host-specific indicators and applying machine learning methods.
AB  == in this study we use a machine learning software (ichnaea) to generate predictive models for water samples with different concentrations of fecal contamination (point source, moderate and low). we applied several mst methods (host-specific bacteroides phages, mitochondrial dna genetic markers, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium dentium markers, and bifidobacterial host-specific qpcr), and general indicators (escherichia coli, enterococci and somatic coliphages) to evaluate the source of contamination in the samples. the results provided data to the ichnaea software, that evaluated the performance of  each method in the different scenarios and determined the source of the contamination. almost all mst methods in this study determined correctly the origin of fecal contamination at point source and in moderate concentration samples. when the dilution of the fecal pollution increased (below 3 log10 cfu e. coli/100 ml) some of these indicators (bifidobacterial host-specific qpcr, some mitochondrial markers or b. dentium marker) were not suitable because their concentrations decreased below the detection limit. using the data from source point samples, the software ichnaea produced models for waters with low levels of fecal pollution. these models included some mst methods, on the basis of their best performance, that were used to determine the source of pollution in this area. regardless the methods selected, that could vary depending on the scenario, inductive machine learning methods are a promising tool in mst studies and may represent a leap forward in solving mst cases.

TI  == biosynthesis and cellular content of folate in bifidobacteria across host species with different diets.
AB  == background: bifidobacteria, one of the most common bacteria of the intestinal tract, help establish balance in the gut microbiota and confer health benefits to the host. one beneficial property is folate biosynthesis, which is dependent on species and strains. it is unclear whether the diversity in folate biosynthesis is due to the adaptation of the bifidobacteria to the host diet or whether it is  related to the phylogeny of the animal host. to date, folate production has been  studied in the bifidobacteria of omnivorous, and a few herbivorous, non-primate hosts and humans, but not in carnivores, non-human primates and insects. in our study we screened folate content and composition in bifidobacteria isolated from  carnivores (dog and cheetah), hominoidea omnivorous non-human primates (chimpanzee and orangutan) and nectarivorous insects (honey bee). results: bifidobacterium pseudolongum subsp. globosum, a species typically found in non-primates, was isolated from dog and cheetah, and bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium dentium, species typically found in humans, were respectively obtained from orangutan and chimpanzee. evidence of folate biosynthesis was found in bifidobacteria isolated from non-human primates, but not from the bifidobacteria of carnivores and honey-bee. on comparing species from different hosts, such as poultry and herbivorous/omnivorous non-primates, it would appear that folate production is characteristic of primate (human and non-human) bifidobacteria but not of non-primate. isolates from orangutan and chimpanzee had a high total folate content, the mean values being 7792 mug/100 g dry matter (dm) for chimpanzee and 8368 mug/100 g dm for orangutan. the tetrahydrofolate (h4folate) and 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-ch3-h4folate) distribution varied in  the bifidobacteria of the different animal species, but remained similar in the strains of the same species: b. dentium chz9 contained the least 5-ch3-h4folate (3749 mu/100 g dm), while b. adolescentis org10 contained the most (8210 mug/100  g dm). conclusion: our data suggest a correlation between phylogenetic lineage and capacity of folate production by bifidobacteria, rather than with dietary type of the host.

TI  == tolerance of bifidobacterium human isolates to bile, acid and oxygen.
AB  == bifidobacteria are part of the human gastrointestinal microbiota and are used as  probiotics in functional food products because of their health promoting properties. however, only few data are available on the phenotypic characteristics displayed by human bifidobacteria strain populations. in this study we compared the in vitro tolerance to acid, bile and oxygen of the largest  number of independent human intestinal strains. bile and acid tolerance varied among species and independent strains within a species: b. adolescentis strains were the most tolerant to bile followed by bifidobacterium longum and b. breve; b. longum, b. breve and b. dentium showed the highest viability levels after exposure to acid ph. oxygen tolerance was largely distributed among intestinal bifidobacteria: b. longum, b. breve and b. bifidum showed the highest oxygen tolerance. b. adolescentis showed the highest susceptibility to acid and oxygen stresses. the present study gave us the opportunity to update our knowledge about the phenotypic characteristics of human intestinal bifidobacteria. b. longum and  b. breve harboured the best tolerance to oxygen, bile and acid stresses. based on such biological characters, b. longum and b. breve species showed the highest interest in terms of potential selection of human probiotics.

TI  == isolation of a bifidogenic peptide from the pepsin hydrolysate of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein found in the milk of most mammals for which various biological functions have been reported, such as antimicrobial activity and bifidogenic activity. in this study, we compared the bifidogenic activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf) and pepsin hydrolysate of blf (blfh), isolated bifidogenic peptide from blfh, and investigated the bifidogenic spectra  of blf, blfh, and its active peptide against 42 bifidobacterial strains comprising nine species. against bifidobacterium breve atcc 15700(t), minimal effective concentrations of blf and blfh were 300 and 10 mug/ml. against bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis atcc 15697(t), the minimal effective concentration of blfh was 30 mug/ml, and blf did not show bifidogenic activity within 300 mug/ml. as an active peptide, a heterodimer of a(1)-w(16) and l(43)-a(48) linked by a disulfide bond was isolated. previously, this peptide was identified as having antibacterial activity. an amino acid mixture with the same  composition as this peptide showed no bifidogenic activity. the strains of each species whose growth was highly promoted (>150%) by this peptide at 3.75 mum were as follows: b. breve (7 out of 7 strains [7/7]), b. longum subsp. infantis (5/5), bifidobacterium bifidum (2/5), b. longum subsp. longum (1/3), bifidobacterium adolescentis (3/6), bifidobacterium catenulatum (1/4), bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum (0/4), bifidobacterium dentium (0/5), and bifidobacterium angulatum (0/3). growth of none of the strains was highly promoted by blf at 3.75 mum. we demonstrated that blfh showed stronger bifidogenic activity than natural  blf, especially against infant-representative species, b. breve and b. longum subsp. infantis; furthermore, we isolated its active peptide. this is the first report about a bifidogenic peptide derived from blf.

TI  == bifidobacterial succession and correlation networks in a large unselected cohort  of mothers and their children.
AB  == bifidobacteria are a major microbial component of infant gut microbiota, which is believed to promote health benefits for the host and stimulate maturation of the  immune system. despite their perceived importance, very little is known about the natural development of and possible correlations between bifidobacteria in human  populations. to address this knowledge gap, we analyzed stool samples from a randomly selected healthy cohort of 87 infants and their mothers with >90% of vaginal delivery and nearly 100% breast-feeding at 4 months. fecal material was sampled during pregnancy, at 3 and 10 days, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years after birth. stool samples were predicted to be rich in the species bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, b. breve, and b. longum. due to high variation, we did not identify a clear age-related structure at the individual level. within the population as a whole, however, there were clear age-related successions. negative correlations between the b. longum group and b. adolescentis were detected in adults and in 1- and 2-year-old children, whereas negative correlations between b. longum and b. breve were characteristic for newborns and 4-month-old infants. the highly structured age-related development of and correlation networks between bifidobacterial species during the first 2 years of life mirrors their different or competing nutritional requirements, which in turn may be associated with specific biological functions in the development of healthy gut.

TI  == quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by use of quantitative real-time pcr analysis targeting the groel gene.
AB  == quantitative real-time pcr assays targeting the groel gene for the specific enumeration of 12 human fecal bifidobacterium species were developed. the housekeeping gene groel (hsp60 in eukaryotes) was used as a discriminative marker for the differentiation of bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. animalis, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. gallicum, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. pseudolongum, and b. thermophilum. the bifidobacterial chromosome contains a single copy of the groel gene, allowing the determination of the cell number by quantification of the groel copy number. real-time pcr assays were validated by comparing fecal samples spiked with known  numbers of a given bifidobacterium species. independent of the bifidobacterium species tested, the proportion of groel copies recovered from fecal samples spiked with 5 to 9 log(10) cells/g feces was approximately 50%. the quantification limit was 5 to 6 log(10) groel copies/g feces. the interassay variability was less than 10%, and variability between different dna extractions  was less than 23%. the method developed was applied to fecal samples from healthy adults and full-term breast-fed infants. bifidobacterial diversity in both adults and infants was low, with mostly </=3 bifidobacterium species and b. longum frequently detected. the predominant species in infant and adult fecal samples were b. breve and b. adolescentis, respectively. it was possible to distinguish b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum. we conclude that the groel gene is a suitable molecular marker for the specific and accurate quantification of human fecal bifidobacterium species by real-time pcr.

TI  == effects of administration of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis gcl2505 on defecation frequency and bifidobacterial microbiota composition in humans.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in endogenous bifidobacteria and administered bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (b. lactis) gcl2505 (gcl2505) in the intestine after administration of gcl2505 by means of a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross-over study. an increase in the number of total bifidobacteria (the sum of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. longum subsp. longum, b. adolescentis, b. anglatum, b. catenulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. dentium, b. longum subsp. infantis and b. lactis) in the feces were observed after administration of gcl2505 using species- and subspecies-specific real-time  polymerase chain reaction analysis. however, the number of endogenous bifidobacteria species (excluding b. lactis) remained unchanged. b. lactis also became the predominant bifidobacterial species. taking into account the number of gcl2505 administered, the findings further suggested that gcl2505 proliferated in the intestine. in addition, the defecation frequency increased during gcl2505 administration compared with the placebo. moreover, a single administration study (n=17) clearly demonstrated that gcl2505 successfully reached the intestine before proliferating at least 10-fold. this is the first report to show an increase in intestinal bifidobacteria, with no changes to the endogenous species, and improvements in constipation following proliferation of administered bifidobacteria.

TI  == genetic analysis and morphological identification of pilus-like structures in members of the genus bifidobacterium.
AB  == background: cell surface pili in gram positive bacteria have been reported to orchestrate the colonization of host tissues, evasion of immunity and the development of biofilms. so far, little if any information is available on the presence of pilus-like structures in human gut commensals like bifidobacteria. results and discussion: in this report, atomic force microscopy (afm) of various  bifidobacterial strains belonging to bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis revealed the existence of appendages resembling pilus-like structures. interestingly, these microorganisms harbour two to six predicted pilus gene clusters in their genome, with each organized in an operon encompassing the major pilin subunit-encoding gene (designated fima or fimp) together with one or two minor pilin subunit-encoding genes (designated as  fimb and/or fimq), and a gene encoding a sortase enzyme (stra). quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr analysis and rt-pcr experiments revealed a polycistronic mrna, encompassing the fima/p and fimb/q genes, which are differentially expressed upon cultivation of bifidobacteria on various glycans.

TI  == molecular indicators used in the development of predictive models for microbial source tracking.
AB  == a number of chemical, microbial, and eukaryotic indicators have been proposed as  indicators of fecal pollution sources in water bodies. no single one of the indicators tested to date has been able to determine the source of fecal pollution in water. however, the combined use of different indicators has been demonstrated to be the best way of defining predictive models suitable for determining fecal pollution sources. molecular methods are promising tools that could complement standard microbiological water analysis. in this study, the feasibility of some proposed molecular indicators for microbial source tracking (mst) was compared (names of markers are in parentheses): host-specific bacteroidetes (hf134, hf183, cf128, and cf193), bifidobacterium adolescentis (ado), bifidobacterium dentium (den), the gene esp of enterococcus faecium, and host-specific mitochondrial dna associated with humans, cattle, and pigs (humito, bomito, and pomito, respectively). none of the individual molecular markers tested enabled 100% source identification. they should be combined with other markers to raise sensitivity and specificity and increase the number of sources that are identified. mst predictive models using only these molecular markers were developed. the models were evaluated by considering the lowest number of molecular indicators needed to obtain the highest rate of identification of fecal sources. the combined use of three molecular markers (ado, bomito, and pomito) enabled correct identification of 75.7% of the samples, with differentiation between human, swine, bovine, and poultry sources. discrimination between human and nonhuman fecal pollution was possible using two markers: ado and pomito (84.6% correct identification). the percentage of correct identification increased with the number of markers analyzed. the best predictive model for distinguishing human from nonhuman fecal sources was based on 5 molecular markers (hf134, ado, den, bomito, and pomito) and provided 90.1% correct classification.

TI  == distribution of in vitro fermentation ability of lacto-n-biose i, a major building block of human milk oligosaccharides, in bifidobacterial strains.
AB  == this study investigated the potential utilization of lacto-n-biose i (lnb) by individual strains of bifidobacteria. lnb is a building block for the human milk  oligosaccharides, which have been suggested to be a factor for selective growth of bifidobacteria. a total of 208 strains comprising 10 species and 4 subspecies  were analyzed for the presence of the galacto-n-biose/lacto-n-biose i phosphorylase (glnbp) gene (lnpa) and examined for growth when lnb was used as the sole carbohydrate source. while all strains of bifidobacterium longum subsp.  longum, b. longum subsp. infantis, b. breve, and b. bifidum were able to grow on  lnb, none of the strains of b. adolescentis, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. angulatum, b. animalis subsp. lactis, and b. thermophilum showed any growth. in addition, some strains of b. pseudocatenulatum, b. animalis subsp. animalis, and  b. pseudolongum exhibited the ability to utilize lnb. with the exception for b. pseudocatenulatum, the presence of lnpa coincided with lnb utilization in almost  all strains. these results indicate that bifidobacterial species, which are the predominant species found in infant intestines, are potential utilizers of lnb. these findings support the hypothesis that glnbp plays a key role in the colonization of bifidobacteria in the infant intestine.

TI  == the persistence of bifidobacteria populations in a river measured by molecular and culture techniques.
AB  == aims: to determine relative to faecal coliforms (fc) and sulfite-reducing clostridia (src), the environmental persistence of natural populations of bifidobacterium spp. enumerated by culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr). methods and results: dialysis tubing containing river supplemented with overnight cultures of bifidobacterium adolescentis (ba) and bifidobacterium dentium (bd) or urban wastewater were suspended in a river for up to 10 days. at intervals, the contents of each dialysis tube were assayed using q-pcr assays for ba and bd, and selective culture media for fc, src, total bifidobacteria (tb), sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria (sfb) and cultivable ba.  mean summer t(90) values were 251 h for src, 92 h for fc, 48 h for ba and bd by q-pcr, and 9 h for tb. conclusions: bifidobacterium spp. was the population with  the lowest persistence, showing seasonal differences in t(90) when measured by culture techniques or by q-pcr. this difference in relative persistence is because of a longer persistence of molecular targets than cultivable cells. significance and impact of the study: the persistence of a viable bifidobacteria  cells is shorter, but the longest persistence of molecular targets. this factor could be used for origin the faecal pollution in water for the development of microbial source tracking (mst).

TI  == exploring the diversity of the bifidobacterial population in the human intestinal tract.
AB  == although the health-promoting roles of bifidobacteria are widely accepted, the diversity of bifidobacteria among the human intestinal microbiota is still poorly understood. we performed a census of bifidobacterial populations from human intestinal mucosal and fecal samples by plating them on selective medium, coupled with molecular analysis of selected rrna gene sequences (16s rrna gene and internally transcribed spacer [its] 16s-23s spacer sequences) of isolated colonies. a total of 900 isolates were collected, of which 704 were shown to belong to bifidobacteria. analyses showed that the culturable bifidobacterial population from intestinal and fecal samples include six main phylogenetic taxa,  i.e., bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium bifidum, and two species mostly detected in fecal samples, i.e.,  bifidobacterium dentium and bifidobacterium animalis subp. lactis. analysis of bifidobacterial distribution based on age of the subject revealed that certain identified bifidobacterial species were exclusively present in the adult human gut microbiota whereas others were found to be widely distributed. we encountered significant intersubject variability and composition differences between fecal and mucosa-adherent bifidobacterial communities. in contrast, a modest diversification of bifidobacterial populations was noticed between different intestinal regions within the same individual (intrasubject variability). notably, a small number of bifidobacterial isolates were shown to display a wide  ecological distribution, thus suggesting that they possess a broad colonization capacity.

TI  == isolation of bifidobacteria from breast milk and assessment of the bifidobacterial population by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative real-time pcr.
AB  == the objective of this work was to elucidate if breast milk contains bifidobacteria and whether they can be transmitted to the infant gut through breastfeeding. twenty-three women and their respective infants provided samples of breast milk and feces, respectively, at days 4 to 7 after birth. gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates from specific media with typical bifidobacterial shapes were identified to the genus level by f6ppk (fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase) assays and to the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bifidobacterial communities in breast milk were assessed by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), and their levels were estimated by quantitative real-time pcr (qrti-pcr). bifidobacteria were present in 8 milk samples and 21 fecal samples. bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, and b. bifidum were isolated from milk samples, while infant feces also contained b. longum and b. pseudocatenulatum. pcr-dgge revealed the presence of one to four dominant bifidobacterial bands in 22 milk samples. sequences with similarities above 98% were identified as bifidobacterium breve, b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. dentium. bifidobacterial dna was detected by qrti-pcr in the same 22 milk samples at a range between 40 and 10,000 16s rrna gene copies per ml. in conclusion, human milk seems to be a source of living bifidobacteria for the infant gut.

TI  == comparison of intestinal microflora in healthy infants and infants with allergic  colitis.
AB  == twenty-eight exclusively breast-fed healthy infants and 16 infants also exclusively breast-fed with allergic colitis (aged 85 +/- 60 and 98 +/- 58 d, respectively) were screened for differences in fecal flora. bifidobacteria were detected in 23 healthy infants and only in 4 fecal samples of infants with allergic colitis. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia using genus-specific fish probe. infants with allergy colitis possessed significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria and total anaerobes and significantly higher counts of clostridia in their feces. in healthy infants, bifidobacterium longum was the most frequently found species (54.5% of the samples), followed by b. adolescentis (20.0), b. breve (18.2), b. bifidum (16.4), b. dentium (10.9) and b. pseudocatenulatum (1.80). bifidobacterial isolates from  two babies with allergic colitis were identified as b. longum, one child from patients group contained species b. dentium and one baby b. adolescentis. our results suggest that there are significantly lower counts of bifidobacteria in infants with allergic colitis than in healthy infants.

TI  == effect of inulin on the human gut microbiota: stimulation of bifidobacterium adolescentis and faecalibacterium prausnitzii.
AB  == prebiotics are food ingredients that improve health by modulating the colonic microbiota. the bifidogenic effect of the prebiotic inulin is well established; however, it remains unclear which species of bifidobacterium are stimulated in vivo and whether bacterial groups other than lactic acid bacteria are affected by inulin consumption. changes in the faecal microbiota composition were examined by real-time pcr in twelve human volunteers after ingestion of inulin (10 g/d) for a 16-d period in comparison with a control period without any supplement intake. the prevalence of most bacterial groups examined did not change after inulin intake, although the low g+c % gram-positive species faecalibacterium prausnitzii exhibited a significant increase (10.3% for control period v. 14.5% during inulin intake, p=0.019). the composition of the genus bifidobacterium was studied in four of the volunteers by clone library analysis. between three and five bifidobacterium spp. were found in each volunteer. bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium longum were present in all volunteers, and bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium were also detected. real-time pcr was employed to quantify the four most prevalent bifidobacterium spp., b. adolescentis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum and b. bifidum, in ten volunteers carrying detectable levels of bifidobacteria. b. adolescentis showed the strongest response to inulin consumption, increasing from 0.89 to 3.9% of the total microbiota (p=0.001). b. bifidum was increased from 0.22 to 0.63% (p<0.001) for the five volunteers for whom this species was present.

TI  == evaluation of the pcr method for identification of bifidobacterium species.
AB  == aims: bifidobacterium species are known for their beneficial effects on health and their wide use as probiotics. although various polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods for the identification of bifidobacterium species have been published, the reliability of these methods remains open to question. methods and results: in this study, we evaluated 37 previously reported pcr primer sets designed to amplify 16s rdna, 23s rdna, intergenic spacer regions, or repetitive  dna sequences of various bifidobacterium species. conclusions: ten of 37 experimental primer sets showed specificity for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. pseudocatenulatum, b. breve, b. bifidum, b. longum, b. longum biovar infantis and b. dentium. significance and impact of the study: the results suggest that published bifidobacterium primer sets should be re-evaluated for both reproducibility and specificity for the identification of bifidobacterium species using pcr. improvement of existing pcr methods will be needed to facilitate identification of other bifidobacterium strains, such as b. animalis, b. catenulatum, b. thermophilum and b. subtile.

TI  == gnotobiotic mouse immune response induced by bifidobacterium sp. strains isolated from infants.
AB  == bifidobacterium, which is a dominant genus in infants' fecal flora and can be used as a probiotic, has shown beneficial effects in various pathologies, including allergic diseases, but its role in immunity has so far been little known. numerous studies have shown the crucial role of the initial intestinal colonization in the development of the intestinal immune system, and bifidobacteria could play a major role in this process. for a better understanding of the effect of bifidobacterium on the immune system, we aimed at  determining the impact of bifidobacterium on the t-helper 1 (t(h)1)/t(h)2 balance by using gnotobiotic mice. germfree mice were inoculated with bifidobacterium longum ncc2705, whose genome is sequenced, and with nine bifidobacterium strains  isolated from infants' fecal flora. five days after inoculation, mice were killed. transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), interleukin-4 (il-4), il-10, and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) gene expressions in the ileum and ifn-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, il-4, and il-5 secretions by splenocytes cultivated for 48 h with concanavalin a were quantified. two bifidobacterium species had no effect (b. adolescentis) or little effect (b. breve) on the immune system. bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  dentium, and one b. longum strain induced t(h)1 and t(h)2 cytokines at the systemic and intestinal levels. one b. longum strain induced a t(h)2 orientation  with high levels of il-4 and il-10, both secreted by splenocytes, and of tgf-beta gene expression in the ileum. the other two strains induced t(h)1 orientations with high levels of ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha splenocyte secretions. bifidobacterium's capacity to stimulate immunity is species specific, but its influence on the orientation of the immune system is strain specific.

TI  == bifidobacteria in feces and environmental waters.
AB  == bifidobacteria have been recommended as potential indicators of human fecal pollution in surface waters even though very little is known about their presence in nonhuman fecal sources. the objective of this research was to shed light on the occurrence and molecular diversity of this fecal indicator group in different animals and environmental waters. genus- and species-specific 16s rrna gene pcr assays were used to study the presence of bifidobacteria among 269 fecal dna extracts from 32 different animals. twelve samples from three wastewater treatment plants and 34 water samples from two fecally impacted watersheds were also tested. the species-specific assays showed that bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. dentium, and b. catenulatum had the broadest host distribution (11.9 to 17.4%), whereas b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were detected in fewer than 3% of all fecal samples. phylogenetic analysis of 356 bifidobacterial clones obtained from different animal feces showed that ca. 67% of all of the sequences clustered with cultured bifidobacteria, while the rest formed a supercluster with low sequence identity (i.e., <94%) to previously described bifidobacterium spp. the b. pseudolongum subcluster (>97% similarity) contained 53 fecal sequences from seven different animal hosts, suggesting the cosmopolitan distribution of members of this clade. in contrast, two clades containing b. thermophilum and b. boum clustered exclusively with 37 and 18 pig fecal clones, respectively, suggesting host specificity. using species-specific assays, bifidobacteria were detected in only two of the surface water dna extracts, although other fecal anaerobic bacteria were detected in these waters.  overall, the results suggest that the use of bifidobacterial species as potential markers to monitor human fecal pollution in natural waters may be questionable.

AB  == aims: to assess the possibility that bifidobacteria compete with porphyromonas gingivalis for their mutual growth factor vitamin k. this study also examined whether salivary bifidobacterium species decrease vitamin k concentration in the  growth medium. methods and results: sixty-five strains of bifidobacterium were obtained from 20 of 24 periodontally healthy subjects. bifidobacterium dentium was most frequently detected in the saliva of subjects, followed by bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, and bifidobacterium urinalis. the growth of most bifidobacterium isolates, except that of b. urinalis, was stimulated by vitamin k. moreover, the isolates were capable of decreasing vitamin k after incubation, which suggests that bifidobacteria compete with p. gingivalis for vitamin k. in a co-culture, a representative strain -b. adolescentis s2-1 - inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis if it was inoculated in the medium before p. gingivalis. conclusions: b. adolescentis s2-1 decreased vitamin k concentration and inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis by possibly competing for the growth factor. significance and impact of the study: salivary bifidobacteria may possess the potential to suppress the growth of p. gingivalis  by reducing the growth factor(s) in the environment.

TI  == qualitative and quantitative analyses of the bifidobacterial microbiota in the colonic mucosa of patients with colorectal cancer, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == aim: to characterize the bifidobacterial microbiota of the colonic mucosa in patients with colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticuitis. methods: a sample of the distal colonic mucosa was taken during surgery from a total of 34 patients, twenty-one with diagnosed colorectal cancer, nine with diverticulitis and four with inflammatory bowel disease, requiring surgery for their condition.  bacterial dna was extracted from the resected mucosal samples and bifidobacterial mucosa-associated microbiota was qualitatively and quantitatively determined by means of qualitative and quantitative pcr. results: bifidobacteria were found in  100% of the samples from patients with diverticulitis or ibd and a 76% of those suffering colon cancer. the species b. longum and b. bifidum were the most widely found, followed by b. animalis, b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis. b. breve, b.  dentium and b. angulatum were not detected in any sample. a significantly higher  occurrence of b. longum was observed in patients with diverticulitis than in those with colon cancer or ibd (100%, 62% and 75%, respectively, p < 0.05). similar results were obtained for b. animalis (56%, 0% and 25%, p < 0.05), while  b. adolescentis was only found in the mucosa from patients with colon cancer (5 out of 21, 24%). at the quantitative level, patients with colon cancer or ibd showed lower counts of total bifidobacterium (4.94 and 5.91 vs 6.96 log cells/sample, respectively, p < 0.05) and of the species b. longum (4.05 and 4.79 vs 6.76, p < 0.05) than those with diverticulitis. conclusion: aberrancies in mucosa associated microbiota are present in different intestinal diseases. this may indicate a role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

TI  == quantitative assessment of faecal bifidobacterial populations by real-time pcr using lanthanide probes.
AB  == aim: to develop real-time quantitative pcr methods, based on the use of probes labelled with a stable fluorescent lanthanide chelate, for the quantification of  different human faecal bifidobacterial populations. methods and results: the designed quantitative pcr assays were found to be specific for the corresponding  bifidobacterium species or groups (bifidobacterium longum group, bifidobacterium  catenulatum group, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium dentium).  the detection limits of the methodologies used ranged between 2 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(3) cells g(-1) of faeces. the applicability of the developed assays was tested by analysing 20 human faecal samples. bif. longum group was found to be the qualitatively and quantitatively predominant bifidobacterial group. conclusions:  the real-time pcr procedures developed here are specific, accurate, rapid and easy methods for the quantification of bifidobacterium groups or species in human faecal samples. significance and impact of the study: the developed procedures will facilitate rapid and objective counting of large numbers of samples increasing our knowledge on the role of gut bifidobacterial microbiota in health  and disease. this will contribute to the efficient use of intestinal bacterial assays in research, food and pharmaceutical development as well as in the assessment of dietary management of diseases.

TI  == population dynamics of bifidobacterium species in human feces during raffinose administration monitored by fluorescence in situ hybridization-flow cytometry.
AB  == the population dynamics of bifidobacteria in human feces during raffinose administration were investigated at the species level by using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) coupled with flow cytometry (fcm) analysis. although double-staining fish-fcm using both fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc) and indodicarbocyanine (cy5) as labeling dyes for fecal samples has been reported, the analysis was interfered with by strong autofluorescence at the fitc fluorescence region because of the presence of autofluorescence particles/debris  in the fecal samples. we circumvented this problem by using only cy5 fluorescent  dye in the fish-fcm analysis. thirteen subjects received 2 g of raffinose twice a day for 4 weeks. fecal samples were collected, and the bifidobacterial populations were monitored using the established fish-fcm method. the results showed an increase in bifidobacteria from about 12.5% of total bacteria in the prefeeding period to about 28.7 and 37.2% after the 2-week and 4-week feeding periods, respectively. bifidobacterium adolescentis, the bifidobacterium catenulatum group, and bifidobacterium longum were the major species, in that order, at the prefeeding period, and these bacteria were found to increase nearly in parallel during the raffinose administration. during the feeding periods, indigenous bifidobacterial populations became more diverse, such that minor species in human adults, such as bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium bifidum,  bifidobacterium dentium, and bifidobacterium angulatum, proliferated. four weeks  after raffinose administration was stopped, the proportion of each major bifidobacterial species, as well as that of total bifidobacteria, returned to approximately the original values for the prefeeding period, whereas that of each minor species appeared to differ considerably from its original value. to the best of our knowledge, these results provide the first clear demonstration of the population dynamics of indigenous bifidobacteria at the species level in response to raffinose administration.

TI  == integrated analysis of established and novel microbial and chemical methods for microbial source tracking.
AB  == several microbes and chemicals have been considered as potential tracers to identify fecal sources in the environment. however, to date, no one approach has  been shown to accurately identify the origins of fecal pollution in aquatic environments. in this multilaboratory study, different microbial and chemical indicators were analyzed in order to distinguish human fecal sources from nonhuman fecal sources using wastewaters and slurries from diverse geographical areas within europe. twenty-six parameters, which were later combined to form derived variables for statistical analyses, were obtained by performing methods that were achievable in all the participant laboratories: enumeration of fecal coliform bacteria, enterococci, clostridia, somatic coliphages, f-specific rna phages, bacteriophages infecting bacteroides fragilis ryc2056 and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ga17, and total and sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria; genotyping of f-specific rna phages; biochemical phenotyping of fecal coliform bacteria and enterococci using miniaturized tests; specific detection of bifidobacterium adolescentis and bifidobacterium dentium; and measurement of four fecal sterols. a number of potentially useful source indicators were detected (bacteriophages infecting b. thetaiotaomicron, certain genotypes of f-specific bacteriophages, sorbitol-fermenting bifidobacteria, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and epycoprostanol), although no one source identifier alone provided 100% correct classification of the fecal source. subsequently, 38 variables (both single and derived) were defined from the measured microbial and chemical parameters in order to find the best subset of variables to develop predictive models using the lowest possible number of measured parameters. to this end, several statistical or machine learning methods were evaluated and provided two successful predictive models based on just two variables, giving 100% correct classification: the ratio of the densities of somatic coliphages and phages infecting bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to the density of somatic coliphages and the ratio of the densities of fecal coliform bacteria and phages infecting bacteroides thetaiotaomicron to the density of fecal coliform bacteria. other models with high rates of correct classification were developed, but in these cases, higher numbers of variables were required.

TI  == [a molecular-and-genetic analysis of species and strain diversity of bifidobacteria in early childhood].
AB  == the species and strain composition of bifidobacteria in 29 children both sexes, aged 8 to 16 months, was studied. species-specific primers and pcr were used to determine to which species the predominant strains of bifidobacteria, isolated from feces by cultural methods, belonged. bifidobacteria were found in 28 (96.5%) children; their number was 10.2 +/- 0.7 ecu per a gram of the material. b. longum and b. bifidum were frequent (71.4 and 53.5%, respectively). the level of quantitative detection used in the study also allowed revealing of b. catenulatum (17.9%) and b. breve (14.4%). a high titer of b. dentium was found in one case (3.6%). b. adolescentis and b. angulatum were not found in any patient. the average number of species found in one child was 1.7 +/- 0.7. rapd-pcr and investigation of plasmid profile were used to determine possible belonging of the isolates to different strains. the average number of strains per one sample was 2.3 +/- 1.2. nine unique plasmid bifidobacterial strains were isolated from 7 children. in 3 children the intestinal tract was found to be colonized by both plasmid and non-plasmid-carrying strains of one bifidobacterial species.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr assays to identify and quantify fecal bifidobacterium  species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == a healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the  infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different bifidobacterium species. it has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific bifidobacterium species than healthy infants. for the accurate quantification of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium angulatum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples, duplex 5' nuclease assays  were developed. the assays, targeting rrna gene intergenic spacer regions, were validated and compared with conventional pcr and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods. the 5' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides (osf). a breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference. the results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria (54.8% +/- 9.8% to 73.4% +/- 4.0%) in infants receiving the prebiotic formula (osf), with a diversity of bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more b. catenulatum and b. adolescentis (2.71% +/- 1.92% and 8.11% +/- 4.12%, respectively, versus 0.15% +/- 0.11% and 1.38% +/- 0.98% for the osf group). in conclusion, the specific prebiotic infant  formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of  breast-fed infants also at the level of the different bifidobacterium species.

TI  == development of multi-color fish method for analysis of seven bifidobacterium species in human feces.
AB  == we have developed a multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) method  which detects, by a single reaction, all seven species of bifidobacterium (b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, and b. longum), the dominant bacteria in human feces. first, eight new types of oligonucleotide probe were designed, complementary with the 16s rrna sequence specific to genus bifidobacterium and each bifidobacterial species described above. using whole cell hybridization, the fluorescent intensity was measured against the bacterial species targeted by each probe, to show that each probe is  specific to the targeted bacteria and that the relative fluorescent intensity (rfi) as an indicator of probe accessibility is high at 61-117%. then, bacterial  species-specific probes were labeled with fluorochromes (fitc, tamra and cy5) in  seven different ways, singly or in combination. using these probes, seven species of bifidobacterium were differentially stained in mixed samples of cultured bacteria and feces from adult volunteers, proving the efficacy of this technique.

TI  == enumeration, isolation, and identification of bifidobacteria from infant feces.
AB  == thirty-three fully breast-fed infants aged between 1 and 12 weeks were screened for bifidobacteria in feces. bifidobacteria counts in most fecal samples determined both by tpy agar and fish procedure ranged from 10(8) to 10(11) cfu/g. three infants did not contain any bifidobacteria in their fecal samples. one child was delivered by caesarean section and the other two by normal vaginal delivery. all bifidobacteria-free infants possessed gram-positive regular rods as a major group of their fecal flora. these bacteria were identified as clostridia  using genus-specific fish probe. in bifidobacteria-positive samples, b. longum (57.9% of the samples) was the most frequently found species, followed by b. adolescentis (31.6%), b. bifidum (21.0%), b. breve (10.5%), b. pseudocatenulatum  (5.3%), and b. dentium (5.3%).

TI  == multiplex pcr with 16s rrna gene-targeted primers of bifidobacterium spp. to identify sources of fecal pollution.
AB  == bifidobacteria are one of the most common bacterial types found in the intestines of humans and other animals and may be used as indicators of human fecal pollution. the presence of nine human-related bifidobacterium species was analyzed in human and animal wastewater samples of different origins by using species-specific primers based on 16s rrna sequences. only b. adolescentis and b. dentium were found exclusively in human sewage. a multiplex pcr approach with strain-specific primers was developed. the method showed a sensitivity threshold  of 10 cells/ml. this new molecular method could provide useful information for the characterization of fecal pollution sources.

TI  == species specific identification of nine human bifidobacterium spp. in feces.
AB  == based on the 16s rdna sequences, species specific primers were designed for the rapid identification by dna amplification of nine human bifidobacterium spp., namely b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, b. catenulatum, b. dentium, b. infantis, b. longum, b. pseudocatenulatum. b. lactis currently included in dairy products was added to the series. the primers were designed to  target different positions of the 16s rdna, allowing the simultaneous identification of these ten species of bifidobacterium using two mixtures of primers. the identification procedure described in this paper was validated by establishing a correlation with an alui restriction pattern of the different full length amplified 16s rdna. this multiple primer dna amplification technique was applied for the identification of pure colonies of bifidobacterium spp. or directly from total bacteria recovered from human fecal samples. the technique was shown to be useful to detect dominant species and, when primers were used in  separate reactions, underrepresented species could be identified as well.

TI  == molecular microbial analysis of bifidobacterium isolates from different environments by the species-specific amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra).
AB  == one hundred and six isolates of the genus bifidobacterium, isolated from different environments (mainly gastrointestinal), were identified and classified  taxonomically to species level by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. two restriction endonucleases (sau3ai and bamhi) were chosen for aligning the 16s rrna sequences of 16 bifidobacterial species retrieved from various databases, to obtain species-specific restriction patterns. a rapid and accurate identification scheme was obtained by comparing the resulting 16s rdna digestion profiles of 16  bifidobacterium type-strains and 90 strains of various origins. all of the investigated strains were previously confirmed at the species level as belonging  to the genus bifidobacterium by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation and by polymerase chain reaction amplification with genus- and species-specific primers. the present work demonstrates that species-specific detection of bifidobacterium  adolescentis, bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium  breve, bifidobacterium catenulatum, bifidobacterium coryneforme, bifidobacterium  cuniculi, bifidobacterium dentium, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium suis, bifidobacterium magnum, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and bifidobacterium pullorum present in different micro-ecological environments (e.g. gastrointestinal tract) can be accomplished in a reliable, rapid and accurate manner, circumventing the recognised deficiencies of traditional identification techniques.

TI  == distribution of bifidobacterial species in human intestinal microflora examined with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers.
AB  == in order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract, a 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific pcr technique was developed and used with dnas extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants. to cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract, species-specific primers for bifidobacterium longum, b. infantis, b. dentium, and b. gallicum were developed and used with primers for b. adolescentis, b. angulatum, b. bifidum, b. breve, and the b. catenulatum group (b. catenulatum and b. pseudocatenulatum) that were developed in a previous study (t. matsuki, k. watanabe, r. tanaka, and h. oyaizu, fems microbiol. lett. 167:113-121, 1998). the specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by pcr, and the species-specific pcr method was found to be a useful means for identifying bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces. the results of an examination  of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the b. catenulatum group was  the most commonly found taxon (detected in 44 of 48 samples [92%]), followed by b. longum and b. adolescentis, in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and  that b. breve, b. infantis, and b. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants. the present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately.

TI  == isolation of a human intestinal anaerobe, bifidobacterium sp. strain sen, capable of hydrolyzing sennosides to sennidins.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic bacterium capable of metabolizing sennosides was isolated from human feces and identified as bifidobacterium sp., named strain sen. the bacterium hydrolyzed sennosides a and b to sennidins a and b via sennidin a and b 8-monoglucosides, respectively. among nine species of bifidobacterium having beta-glucosidase activity, only bifidobacterium dentium and b. adolescentis metabolized sennoside b to sennidin b, suggesting that the sennoside-metabolizing bacteria produce a novel type of beta-glucosidase capable of hydrolyzing sennosides to sennidins.

TI  == phenotypic differentiation of bifidobacteria of human and animal origins.
AB  == the phenotypes of 153 strains belonging or related to the genus bifidobacterium were studied. these organisms included 38 collection strains and 115 wild strains (41 strains of human origin, 56 strains of animal origin, and 18 strains obtained from rivers or sewage). our phenotypic analysis revealed seven main groups that were subdivided into 20 subgroups. seven subgroups contained no type or collection strain. among the human strains, the type strains of bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and b. catenulatum fell into group i, which contained the type  strains of b. adolescentis (subgroup ib), b. dentium (subgroup ic), and b. angulatum (ungrouped). the type strain of b. breve belonged to subgroup iiia1, and the type strains of b. infantis and b. longum fell into subgroup iiib1. group vii comprised only wild strains that were isolated from human infant feces. among the animal strains, group ii consisted mainly of bifidobacteria that were isolated from pig feces and contained the type strains of b. suis (subgroup iib), b. thermophilum (subgroup iif), b. choerinum, and b. boum (ungrouped). wild strains belonging to group v were isolated from pig, calf, cow, and chicken feces; this included the type strains of b. animalis (subgroup va), b. magnum (subgroup vb), b. pseudolongum, and b. globosum (subgroup vc). the strains of human origin (groups i, iii, and vii) were well separated from the animal strains (groups ii, iv, and v). it was not surprising that the wild strains isolated from surface water or sewage were distributed in the animal groups as well as the human groups. thus, bifidobacteria can be considered to be successful indicators  of human or animal fecal pollution when they are correctly classified. the acidification patterns were not adequate to differentiate bifidobacterium species, as determined previously by mitsuoka (bifidobacteria microflora 3:11-28, 1984) and scardovi (p. 1418-1434, in p. h. a. sneath, n. s. mair, m. e. sharpe, and j. g. holt, ed., bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology, vol. 2, 1986). however, enzymatic tests furnished new taxonomic criteria for the genus.
