TI  == subgingival microbiome in smokers and non-smokers in korean chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == smoking is a major environmental factor associated with periodontal diseases. however, we still have a very limited understanding of the relationship between smoking and subgingival microflora in the global population. here, we investigated the composition of subgingival bacterial communities from the pooled plaque samples of smokers and non-smokers, 134 samples in each group, in korean patients with moderate chronic periodontitis using 16s rrna gene-based pyrosequencing. a total of 17,927 reads were analyzed and classified into 12 phyla, 126 genera, and 394 species. differences in bacterial communities between  smokers and non-smokers were examined at all phylogenetic levels. the genera fusobacterium, fretibacterium, streptococcus, veillonella, corynebacterium, tm7,  and filifactor were abundant in smokers. on the other hand, prevotella, campylobacter, aggregatibacter, veillonellaceae gq422718, haemophilus, and prevotellaceae were less abundant in smokers. among species-level taxa occupying  > 1% of whole subgingival microbiome of smokers, higher abundance (>/= 2.0-fold compared to non-smokers) of seven species or operational taxonomic units (otus) was found: fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria sicca, neisseria oralis, corynebacterium matruchotii, veillonella dispar, filifactor alocis, and fretibacterium ay349371. on the other hand, lower abundance of 11 species or otus was found in smokers: neisseria elongata, six prevotella species or otus, fusobacterium canifelinum, aggregatibacter am420165, selenomonas otu, and veillonellaceae gu470897. species richness and evenness were similar between the  groups whereas diversity was greater in smokers than non-smokers. collectively, the results of the present study indicate that differences exist in the subgingival bacterial community between smoker and non-smoker patients with chronic moderate periodontitis in korea, suggesting that cigarette smoking considerably affects subgingival bacterial ecology.

TI  == microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by sanger sequencing.
AB  == background and objective: to examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty  subjects were assigned to a control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as  well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). in the test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. in both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results:  the phylogenetic identity of 1387 16s rrna gene clones was determined. healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of actinomyces, atopobium, gemella, kingella and rothia and lower levels of campylobacter, desulfobulbus, dialister,  eubacterium, filifactor, mitsukella, porphyromonas and pseudoramibacter (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). fusobacterium nucleatum, dialister invisus, streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (hot) 064, filifactor alocis and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while veillonella dispar, actinomyces meyeri, granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the  peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the control and test groups (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as f. alocis, d. invisus and mitsuokella sp. hot 131.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16s rrna gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16s rrna genes from dna isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), peptostreptococcus micros/peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone aj062/bs044/fg014, prevotella species, dialister species, mogibacterium species, lachnospiraceae oral clone 55a-34, filifactor alocis, megasphaera sp. oral clone cs025/bs073, and veillonella sp. oral clone bp1-85/veillonella dispar/v. parvula. bacteroides-like sp. oral clone x083/bacteroidales oral clone mce7_20 and dialister sp. oral clone bs016/mce7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. on the other hand, f. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, prevotella intermedia, dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.
