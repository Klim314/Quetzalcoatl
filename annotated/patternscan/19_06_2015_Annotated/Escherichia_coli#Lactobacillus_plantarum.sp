TI  == fermentation of table olives by oleuropeinolytic starter culture in reduced salt  brines and inactivation of escherichia coli o157:h7 and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the effect of an autochthonous starter culture developed by oleuropeinolytic strains belonging to the lactobacillus plantarum group on the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics and the biophenol content of table olives fermented under reduced salt conditions was studied. black (cv. kalamata) and green (cv. chalkidikis) olives were fermented in two different kinds of brine (brine a containing 2.3% nacl, 32.3mm ca-acetate and 33.9mm ca-lactate and brine  b containing 4% nacl, ph5.0 in both brines). the sensory attributes of olives fermented by oleuropeinolytic starter culture assessed by a trained panel did not differ significantly compared with industrial processing. it is possible to carry out significant changes in table olive processing applying a completely microbiological procedure using oleuropeinolytic strains of the l. plantarum group as both the debittering and the fermentation agent in order to achieve improved sensorial and nutritional characteristics of the final product. table olives processed by the suggested methodology may constitute a good source of biophenols in the diet, especially hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. the inactivation potential of escherichia coli o157 edl-932 and listeria monocytogenes scott a in  olives fermented by oleuropeinolytic starter culture was evaluated. the population of each pathogen in olive homogenates of both cultivars is inactivated by more than 6logcfu/ml in less than 24h. when whole fermented olives were submerged in peptone/saline (containing 6.7logcfu/ml of the relevant bacterial pathogen) for 30min followed by rinsing in distilled water, the population of viable foodborne pathogens dropped more than 4 logs in olive pulp. during subsequent storage at 22 or 4 degrees c the population of l. monocytogenes scott  a was further eliminated under the detection limit in both olive cultivars whereas the population of e. coli o157 edl-932 could be detected in olives stored in peptone/saline at 22 degrees c for 7days. the inhibitory effect of olives fermented by oleuropeinolytic starter culture in reduced salt brines on pathogens is due to the antimicrobial activity of the phenolic compounds and the antagonistic action of the associated microflora.

TI  == scaling up the production of recombinant antimicrobial plantaricin e from a heterologous host, escherichia coli.
AB  == enhanced production of heterologously expressed plantaricin (plne) from escherichia coli bl21 (de3) was achieved from a small- to large-scale batch culture. starting from a 15-ml shake-flask culture grown in luria-bertani (lb) broth, the protein expression could be scaled up using 50 ml, 100 ml, 1 l, and 2  l batch culture. using similar condition, plantaricin e (plne) was successfully expressed in a 30-l stirred fermenter. the protein was expressed as trx-(his)6-fusion protein and separated by ni2+ affinity chromatography. growth in two complex media, lb and terrific broth (tb), was optimized and compared for  the production of plne, which was higher in lb in comparison with that of tb. in  the fermenter, 140 and 180 mg of plne could be produced from 12 l of culture volume at 30 and 25 degrees c, respectively. the yield of heterologously purified plne was found to be 1.2-1.5 %, which was much higher in comparison with the plantaricins produced from the native strain of lactobacillus plantarum (0.3-0.7  %). overproduction of plne with the help of heterologous expression can overcome  the constraint of the low yield from producer strain and provides an easy and low-cost strategy for large-scale production.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == in vitro activity of a recombinant abc transporter protein in the processing of plantaricin e pre-peptide.
AB  == most bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria (lab) are initially synthesized as pre-peptides with an n-terminal extension (leader peptides). generally, the precursor peptides containing a double-glycine-type leader are processed by a dedicated atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter. the abc transporter and an accessory protein lead to the cleavage of inactive pre-peptide with the concomitant export of the mature peptide across the cytoplasmic membrane. plantaricins e, f, j, and k belong to class iib 2-peptide bacteriocins and are synthesized as pre-peptides containing n-terminal g-g leader peptide. in this study, the heterologous expression, purification, and characterization of plne pre-peptide, abc transporter (plng), and accessory protein (plnh) from lactobacillus plantarum lr/14 in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) strain were reported. an in vitro assay was conducted with the inactive plne pre-peptide, which after cleavage by the addition of abc transporter protein exhibited antimicrobial activity against some lab species. the activity of cleaved pre-peptide was comparable to the activity of mature peptide. accessory protein was also heterologously expressed and purified; however, no effect on processing  activity was detected by the addition of the accessory protein, which suggests that accessory protein is not involved in cleavage, but it might help in the transport of mature plantaricins across the membrane.

TI  == expression of heterologous sigma factors enables functional screening of metagenomic and heterologous genomic libraries.
AB  == a key limitation in using heterologous genomic or metagenomic libraries in functional genomics and genome engineering is the low expression of heterologous  genes in screening hosts, such as escherichia coli. to overcome this limitation,  here we generate e. coli strains capable of recognizing heterologous promoters by expressing heterologous sigma factors. among seven sigma factors tested, rpod from lactobacillus plantarum (lpl) appears to be able of initiating transcription from all sources of dna. using the promoter gfp-trap concept, we successfully screen several heterologous and metagenomic dna libraries, thus enlarging the genomic space that can be functionally sampled in e. coli. for an application, we show that screening fosmid-based lpl genomic libraries in an e. coli strain with  a chromosomally integrated lpl rpod enables the identification of lpl genetic determinants imparting strong ethanol tolerance in e. coli. transcriptome analysis confirms increased expression of heterologous genes in the engineered strain.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  == a total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. according to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences and reca gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these lab isolates were identified as five species: lactobacillus (l.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus mundtii, weissella cibaria and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two l. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains zzu 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited salmonella enterica atcc 43971(t), micrococcus luteus atcc 4698(t) and escherichia coli atcc 11775(t) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, ph and protease. cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees c), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees c for 15 min. the antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (ph 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (ph 7.0 to 9.0). in addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease k. these results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains zzu 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. the nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.

TI  == a novel method for screening of potential probiotics for high adhesion capability.
AB  == to screen for potential probiotics with high adhesion capability, a chemostat model-based cultured human feces and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis methods were applied, and the adhesion capability of the isolates was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. lactobacillus plantarum (hm218749), lactobacillus reuteri (eu547310), and enterococcus faecalis (hm218543) were isolated from the slime on  the chemostat wall, as these organisms could grow better at 37 degrees c in an anaerobic environment and could resist harsh conditions (ph 1.5 and 0.30% bile salt). lactobacillus plantarum, l. reuteri, and e. faecalis could adhere to ht-29 cells and reduce the adhesion of shigella dysenteriae 2457, staphylococcus cowan1, enterobacter sakazakii 45401, and escherichia coli 44102 to ht-29 cells.  moreover, the animal experiment showed that l. plantarum could adhere to mice intestine, increasing the number of lactobacilli and decreasing the number of enterococci.

TI  == a study of the effect of dietary fiber fractions obtained from artichoke (cynara  cardunculus l. var. scolymus) on the growth of intestinal bacteria associated with health.
AB  == the effect of different fractions enriched in soluble fiber obtained from artichoke using citric acid or citric acid/hemicellulase on the selective growth  of lactobacillus plantarum 8114 and bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 11863 was evaluated. gompertz modeling of lactobacillus plantarum 8114 growth showed a higher specific growth rate (mu: 0.16 h(-1)) in the presence of fractions isolated from stems using hemicellulase (fraction a) than in the presence of glucose (mu: 0.09 h(-1)). in the case of bifidobacterium bifidum 11863, the highest mu was obtained for the microorganism grown in the presence of fraction a and for the fraction isolated from stems without hemicellulase, their rate being  twice that observed for glucose (0.04 h(-1)). the positive prebiotic activity scores observed with respect to escherichia coli 25922 indicated that fibers assayed are metabolized as well as glucose by lactobacillus plantarum 8114 and bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 11863 and that they are selectively metabolized by these microorganisms. the potential capacity to selectively stimulate the growth  of intestinal bacteria associated with health shown by fraction a can be ascribed to its high inulin and low methylation degree pectin contents.

TI  == anti-inflammatory properties of fermented soy milk with lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis s-su2 in murine macrophage raw264.7 cells and dss-induced ibd model mice.
AB  == six lactic acid bacteria strains (four lactobacillus plantarum strains and one each of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and pediococcus pentosaceus) have been isolated and shown to possess anti-oxidant activity. in this study, we determined their acid, bile, salt resistance, and adhesion activity on human enterocyte-like ht-29-luc and caco-2 cells. an isolate lc. lactis s-su2 showed highest bile resistance and adhesion activity compared to type strains. s-su2 could ferment both 10% skimmed milk and soy milk while the type strain could not ferment soy milk. soy milk fermented with s-su2 showed an increased nitric oxide (no) secretion in the mouse macrophage raw264.7 cells without bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the fermented soy milk on escherichia coli o111 lps-induced no secretion were higher than those of fresh soy milk. inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) was induced in mice fed either 5% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (dss) in drinking water or 50% soy milk in drinking water. shortening of colon length, breaking of epithelial cells, lowering liver and thymus weights, and enlargement of spleen are some of the characteristics observed in the ibd, which were prevented by the use of soy milk  fermented with lc. lactis s-su2.

TI  == construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pjy33 from weissella cibaria 33.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid, pjy33, from weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pjy33 was  2365 bp in size with a gc content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (orfs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino  acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from w. cibaria  klc140. a weissella-escherichia coli shuttle vector, pjy33e (6.5 kb, em(r)), was  constructed by ligation of pjy33 with pbluescript ii sk(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (em(r)). pjy33e replicated in lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus plantarum, and weissella confusa. a  single-stranded dna intermediate was detected from lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pjy33e, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pjy33. most lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pjy33e after one week of daily culturing in mrs broth without em. an aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) from leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in lb. brevis 2.14 using pjy33e, and the highest level of alpha-gal activity (36.13 u/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
AB  == three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were  stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed  broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.

TI  == nitrate reduction to nitrite, nitric oxide and ammonia by gut bacteria under physiological conditions.
AB  == the biological nitrogen cycle involves step-wise reduction of nitrogen oxides to  ammonium salts and oxidation of ammonia back to nitrites and nitrates by plants and bacteria. neither process has been thought to have relevance to mammalian physiology; however in recent years the salivary bacterial reduction of nitrate to nitrite has been recognized as an important metabolic conversion in humans. several enteric bacteria have also shown the ability of catalytic reduction of nitrate to ammonia via nitrite during dissimilatory respiration; however, the importance of this pathway in bacterial species colonizing the human intestine has been little studied. we measured nitrite, nitric oxide (no) and ammonia formation in cultures of escherichia coli, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species grown at different sodium nitrate concentrations and oxygen levels. we found that the presence of 5 mm nitrate provided a growth benefit and induced both nitrite and ammonia generation in e.coli and l.plantarum bacteria grown at oxygen concentrations compatible with the content in the gastrointestinal tract.  nitrite and ammonia accumulated in the growth medium when at least 2.5 mm nitrate was present. time-course curves suggest that nitrate is first converted to nitrite and subsequently to ammonia. strains of l.rhamnosus, l.acidophilus and b.longum infantis grown with nitrate produced minor changes in nitrite or ammonia levels in the cultures. however, when supplied with exogenous nitrite, no gas was readily produced independently of added nitrate. bacterial production of lactic acid causes medium acidification that in turn generates no by non-enzymatic nitrite reduction. in contrast, nitrite was converted to no by e.coli cultures even at neutral ph. we suggest that the bacterial nitrate reduction to ammonia, as well as the related no formation in the gut, could be an important aspect of the overall mammalian nitrate/nitrite/no metabolism and is yet another way in which the microbiome links diet and health.

TI  == plectranthus amboinicus leaves stimulate growth of probiotic l. plantarum: evidence for ethnobotanical use in diarrhea.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: leaves of plectranthus amboinicus are consumed in india along with buttermilk (a probiotic source) during pathogen induced diarrhea. this treatment is known to reduce the number of episodes as well as duration of diarrhea. aim of the study: in the background of its ethnobotanical use, the present investigation was carried out to determine whether, apart from having an antimicrobial activity on pathogens, the leaves could possibly also have a positive effect on the beneficial microflora of the gut resulting in accelerated microbial ecological balance. materials and methods: the growth stimulating activity of the hot water extract (hwe) of p. amboinicus leaves on probiotic lactobacillus plantarum was determined by microbroth dilution technique and viable plate count method in selective medium (mrs) as well as in fermented milk. the ability of the bacteria to utilize the phytoconstituents of hwe primarily phenolic acids and sugars was determined by assaying for phenolic acid  decarboxylase by sds-page and beta-galactosidase activity by beta-gal onpg assay. results: hwe of p. amboinicus leaves inhibited growth of pathogens (escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium) while stimulated the growth of l. plantarum. sds-page gel showed the presence of phenolic acid decarboxylase enzyme induced in the presence of hwe in l. plantarum indicating the utilization of polyphenols by  the bacteria. cells grown on hwe also showed beta-galactosidase activity indicating their ability to utilize sugars present in hwe. conclusion: indian borage leaves have a prebiotic effect on the probiotic bacteria (l. plantarum) which utilizes the phytoconstituents of the leaves by producing necessary metabolic enzymes. this work provides evidence in the traditional use of the leaves in the alleviation of diarrhea by accelerating microbial gut balance during infection.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria: promising supplements for enhancing the biological activities of kombucha.
AB  == kombucha is sweetened black tea that is fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and  yeast embedded within a cellulose membrane. it is considered a health drink in many countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health  benefits. it has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in  that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. there are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. in this study, we examined the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented vietnamese food sources (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity  was assessed by the agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. four strains of food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, escherichia coli atcc 8739, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028 and bacillus cereus atcc 11778. our  findings showed that lactic acid bacteria strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of kombucha. this study illustrates the potential of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir as biosupplements for enhancing the bioactivities of kombucha.

TI  == cocktails of probiotics pre-adapted to multiple stress factors are more robust under simulated gastrointestinal conditions than their parental counterparts and  exhibit enhanced antagonistic capabilities against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: the success of the probiotics in delivery of health benefits depends  on their ability to withstand the technological and gastrointestinal conditions;  hence development of robust cultures is critical to the probiotic industry. combinations of probiotic cultures have proven to be more effective than the use  of single cultures for treatment and prevention of heterogeneous diseases. we investigated the effect of pre- adaptation of probiotics to multiple stresses on  their stability under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and the effect of their singular as well as their synergistic antagonistic effect against selected  enteric pathogens. methods: probiotic cultures were inoculated into mrs broth adjusted to ph 2 and incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees c. survivors of ph 2 were subcultured into 2% bile acid for 1 h at 37 degrees c. cells that showed growth after exposure to 2% bile acid for 1 h were finally inoculated in fresh mrs broth and incubated at 55 degrees c for 2 h. the cells surviving were then used as stress adapted cultures. the adapted cultures were exposed to simulated gastrointestinal conditions and their non- adapted counterparts were used to compare the effects of stress adaptation. the combination cultures were tested for their antipathogenic effects on escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. results: acid and bile tolerances of most of the stress-adapted cells were higher than of the non-adapted cells. viable counts of all the stress-adapted lactobacilli and bifidobacterium longum lmg 13197 were higher after sequential exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. however, for b. longum bb46  and b. bifidum lmg 13197, viability of non-adapted cells was higher than for adapted cells after exposure to these fluids. a cocktail containing l. plantarum  + b. longum bb46 + b. longum lmg 13197 best inhibited s. aureus while e. coli was best inhibited by a combination containing l. acidophilus la14 150b + b. longum bb46 + b. bifidum lmg 11041. a cocktail containing the six non- adapted cultures  was the least effective in inhibiting the pathogens. conclusion: multi-stress pre-adaptation enhances viability of probiotics under simulated gastrointestinal  conditions; and formulations containing a mixture of multi stress-adapted cells exhibits enhanced synergistic effects against foodborne pathogens.

TI  == first two domains at the lp_1643 protein n terminus inhibit pathogen adhesion to  porcine mucus in vitro.
AB  == gastrointestinal probiotics are important members of intestinal microflora in both healthy animals and human beings, and these bacteria may reduce the risk of  infection caused by certain opportunistic pathogens through exclusive inhibition, competition, and displacement. the lp_1643 protein on the cell surface of lactobacillus plantarum wcfsi was assumed to possess a mucus-binding capability.  this study aimed to determine if purified his-n2 protein exclusively inhibits pathogen adhesion to porcine mucus. the interaction of the his-n2 protein with porcine mucus was determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), and the adhesion was assessed by a traditional plating method to count the bacteria adhered to the porcine mucus. indirect elisa showed that his-n2 protein adhered to porcine mucus, and its interacting molecules existed. the his-n2 protein effectively inhibited the adhesion of escherichia coli dh5alpha, listeria monocytogenes cmcc54004, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, and shigella flexneri cmcc(b)51572 to porcine mucus. results showed that inhibition of pathogen adhesion to porcine mucus depended on dose and strain. the adhesion of l. monocytogenes cmcc54004, salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028, and s. flexneri cmcc(b)51572 was reduced by 95.7, 97.0, and 95.7%, respectively, by pre-adding 100 mul of 3.92 mg/ml of his-n2 protein, whereas that of e. coli dh5alpha was only 50.4%. the inhibition of adhesion of some pathogens by his-n2 was different  at ph 6.6 and 7.5. the inhibition of e. coli dh5alpha, l. monocytogenes cmcc54004, and salmonella typhimurium atcc 14028 at ph 6.6 was significantly higher than that at ph 7.5, whereas no statistically significant difference was observed in s. flexneri cmcc(b)51572. these results suggest that various types of inhibition mechanisms of his-n2 were involved in different pathogens.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from sorghum-based traditional fermented food.
AB  == sorghum-based traditional fermented food was screened for potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria. the isolates were identified by biochemical, physiological  and genetic methods. species identification was done by 16s rrna sequence analysis. the functional probiotic potential of the two lactobacillus species viz., lactobacillus plantarum (lact. plantarum) and lactobacillus pentosus (lact. pentosus) was assessed by different standard parameters. the strains were tolerant to ph 2 for 1 h and resistant to methicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin and  norfloxacin. two (lact. plantarum coorg-3 and lact. pentosus coorg-8) out of eight isolates recorded the cell surface hydrophobicity to be 59.12 and 64.06 %,  respectively. all the strains showed tolerance to artificial duodenum juice (ph 2) for 3 h, positive for bile salt hydrolase test and negative for haemolytic test. the neutralized cell-free supernatant of the strains lact. pentosus coorg-4, lact. plantarum coorg-1, lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-8 and lact. plantarum coorg-3 showed good antibiofilm activity. lact. pentosus coorg-8 exhibited 74 % activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa-mtcc 7903 and lact. plantarum coorg-7 showed 68 % inhibition of biofilm against klebsiella pneumonia mtcc 7407. three (lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-5 and lact. pentosus coorg 8) out of eight isolates exhibited a good antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and five isolates (lact. pentosus coorg 2, lact. plantarum coorg 1, lact. plantarum coorg 4, lact. pentosus coorg 3 and lact. plantarum coorg 6) are active against escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis. the study also evaluated the cholesterol lowering property of the lactobacillus strains using hen egg yolk as the cholesterol source. the cholesterol in hen egg yolk was assimilated by 74.12 and 68.26 % by lact. plantarum coorg 4 and lact. pentosus coorg 7, respectively. the results of the present study suggest that the lactobacillus strains isolated and characterized from sorghum-based fermented product may be used as probiotic strains for therapeutic applications.

TI  == induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression by escherichia coli and mycotoxin zearalenone contamination and protection by a lactobacillus mixture in porcine ipec-1 cells.
AB  == this work investigated the effect of escherichia coli k88 and zearalenone contamination on pro-inflammatory gene expression (toll like receptors, cytokines) and signalling molecules and the protective activity of a mixture of lactobacilli sp. (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidofilus and lactobacillus paracasei) in porcine intestinal epithelial cells as part of the local immune system. ipec-1 cell monolayer was exposed for 1 h to the individual  or combined action of e. coli, zearalenone and lactobacilli mixture. our results  showed that tlrs (1-10) and cytokine (il-1,-6,-8,-10, tnf-alpha, ifn-gamma) genes expressed early (after 1 h of culture) in ipec-1 cells. e. coli alone increased the tlrs mrna expression, especially tlr4 and the inflammatory cytokines while zea alone showed either no effect or a marginally effect on tlrs, cytokines, and  signalling genes when compared to untreated cells. the combined actions of the two contaminants lead to a synergistically up-regulation of key cytokines (ifn-gamma, il-10 and tnf-alpha) and tlrs (-2,-3,-4,-6, and -10). the live lactobacilli mixture was able to attenuate the pathogen and mycotoxin-induced response by downregulated the majority of inflammatory related genes suggesting that this mixture has an immunomodulatory potential and may be used to lower the  inflammatory response.

AB  == based on several randomised clinical studies indicating benefit from oral probiotic intake for the prevention of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients, this study aimed to explain the mechanism of action of probiotics for the prevention of lethal experimental infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr)  pseudomonas aeruginosa. experiments using an escherichia coli strain susceptible  to all antimicrobials were also conducted. c57bl/6 mice were pre-treated intraperitoneally with sterile water for injection or lactobacillus plantarum. survival was recorded and mice were sacrificed for measurement of apoptosis and tissue bacterial overgrowth and for isolation and culture of splenocytes for cytokine production. experiments were repeated after pre-treatment with a commercial preparation of four probiotics (l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, saccharomyces boulardii and bifidobacterium lactis; lactolevure((r))). peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) of healthy volunteers were stimulated by heat-killed p. aeruginosa following pre-treatment with medium or probiotics. pre-treatment with l. plantarum significantly prolonged survival after challenge by either mdr p. aeruginosa (66.7% vs. 31.3%;  p=0.026) or e. coli (56.0% vs. 12.0%, p=0.003). survival benefit was even more pronounced when mice were pre-treated with lactolevure((r)). tissue bacterial outgrowth and apoptosis of white blood cells and splenocytes were not altered. tnfalpha and il-10 production by splenocytes of mice pre-treated with probiotic was increased and ifngamma production was decreased. pre-treatment with lactolevure((r)) restored production of il-17. stimulation of human pbmcs after probiotic pre-treatment was accompanied by reduced gene expression of socs3. the  results suggest that the protective effect of probiotics is mediated through prevention of sepsis-induced immunosuppression.

TI  == novel method for screening microbes for application in microbial fuel cell.
AB  == the ability to produce and to transport exo-electrons by microbes either to external acceptors or to electrodes are reported in our study. all investigated microorganisms (exception of lactobacillus plantarum) exhibited strong iron-reducing capabilities in the absence of mediator meaning production and secretion of exo-electrons to the growth medium. l.plantarum, saccharomyces cerevisiae and escherichia coli need an electron shuttle molecule to reduce fe(3+) ion. significant correlation was observed between growth and iron-reducing capacity, as well as between initial cell counts and iron-reducing capacity. changes of bio-current generated in mfc and iron-reduction were experimentally monitored, and a mathematical model was established by regression analysis. based on these results, a novel and rapid screening method was developed for the selection of microorganisms for potential application in mfc. the method is based on the measurement of absorbance of bacterial and yeast cultures at 460 nm, providing a robust and high sample throughput approach.

TI  == characterization and bioactivities of an exopolysaccharide produced by lactobacillus plantarum yw32.
AB  == the exopolysaccharide (eps) produced by lactobacillus plantarum yw32 was purified and characterized, and the in vitro bioactivities of the purified eps were also evaluated. the eps had a molecular weight of 1.03x10(5) da, and it consisted of mannose, fructose, galactose and glucose in an approximate molar ratio of 8.2:1:4.1:4.2. microstructural studies of the eps demonstrated a web-like structure composed of compact ropes, and presence of many homogeneous rod-shaped  lumps. the eps also showed high thermal stability with a degradation temperature  of 283.5 degrees c. furthermore, the eps at a dose of 5mg/ml had strong scavenging abilities toward hydroxyl (77.5%) and superoxide radicals (66.5%). the eps exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on the formation of biofilms by several pathogenic bacteria, including escherichia coli o157, shigella flexneri cmcc (b), staphylococcus aureus ac1 and salmonella typhimurium  s50333. in vitro antitumor assay of the eps showed that it had good inhibitory activity against colon cancer ht-29 cells. these characteristics and bioactivities of the eps would make it a promising candidate for use as a potential food adjunct in foods with healthy properties.

TI  == the use of the replication region of plasmid prs7 from oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a chimeric plasmid, prs7rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of prs7, a large plasmid from oenococcus oeni, and pem64, a plasmid derived from pij2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. prs7rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in escherichia coli using its pij2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (lab) using the replication region of prs7. high levels of transformants per microg of dna were obtained by electroporation of prs7rep into pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). a preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that p. acidilactici and l. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas l. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. prs7rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, bamhi, xbai, sali, hincii, sphi and psti, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in l. plantarum, but was less stable in l. casei and p. acidilactici. the ability of prs7rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from o. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.

TI  == cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity of gold-supported cerium oxide nanoparticles.
AB  == background: cerium oxide nanoparticles (ceo2) have been shown to be a novel therapeutic in many biomedical applications. gold (au) nanoparticles have also attracted widespread interest due to their chemical stability and unique optical  properties. thus, decorating au on ceo2 nanoparticles would have potential for exploitation in the biomedical field. methods: in the present work, ceo2 nanoparticles synthesized by a chemical combustion method were supported with 3.5% au (au/ceo2) by a deposition-precipitation method. the as-synthesized au, ceo2, and au/ceo2 nanoparticles were evaluated for antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity in raw 264.7 normal cells and a549 lung cancer cells. results: the as-synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible measurements. the x-ray diffraction study confirmed the formation of cubic fluorite-structured ceo2 nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm. all synthesized nanoparticles were nontoxic towards raw 264.7 cells at doses of 0-1,000 mum except for au at >100 mum. for a549 cancer cells, au/ceo2 had the highest inhibitory effect, followed by both au and ceo2 which showed a similar effect at 500 and 1,000 mum. initial binding of nanoparticles occurred through localized positively charged sites in a549 cells as shown by a shift in zeta potential from positive to negative after 24 hours of incubation. a dose-dependent elevation in reactive oxygen species indicated that  the pro-oxidant activity of the nanoparticles was responsible for their cytotoxicity towards a549 cells. in addition, cellular uptake seen on transmission electron microscopic images indicated predominant localization of nanoparticles in the cytoplasmic matrix and mitochondrial damage due to oxidative stress. with regard to antibacterial activity, both types of nanoparticles had the strongest inhibitory effect on bacillus subtilis in monoculture systems, followed by salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus,  while, in coculture tests with lactobacillus plantarum, s. aureus was inhibited to a greater extent than the other bacteria. conclusion: gold-supported ceo2 nanoparticles may be a potential nanomaterial for in vivo application owing to their biocompatible and antibacterial properties.

TI  == the toll-like receptor family protein rp105/md1 complex is involved in the immunoregulatory effect of exopolysaccharides from lactobacillus plantarum n14.
AB  == the radioprotective 105 (rp105)/md1 complex is a member of the toll-like receptor (tlr) family. it was reported that rp105/md1 cooperates with the lipopolysaccharide (lps) receptor tlr4/md2 complex and plays a crucial role in the response of immune cells to lps. this work evaluated whether rp105, tlr4 or tlr2 were involved in the immunoregulatory capacities of lactobacillus plantarum  n14 (lp14) or its exopolysaccharides (eps). eps from lp14 were fractionated into  neutral (nps) and acidic (aps) eps by anion exchange chromatography. experiments  with transfectant hek(rp105/md1) and hek(tlr2) cells demonstrated that lp14 strongly activated nf-kappab via rp105 and tlr2. when we studied the capacity of  aps to activate nf-kappab pathway in hek(rp105/md1) and hek(tlr4) cells; we observed that aps strongly stimulated both transfectant cells. our results also showed that lp14 and aps were able to decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-6, il-8 and mcp-1) in porcine intestinal epithelial (pie) cells in  response to enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. in order to confirm the role of tlr2, tlr4 and rp105 in the immunoregulatory effect of aps from lp14, we used small interfering rna (sirna) to knockdown these receptors in  pie cells. the capacity of lp14 and aps to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was significantly reduced in pie(rp105-/-) cells. it was also shown that lp14 and aps were capable of upregulating negative regulators of the tlr signaling in pie cells. this work describes for the first time that a lactobacillus strain and its eps reduce inflammation in intestinal epithelial cells in a rp105/md1-dependend manner.

TI  == characterization of two putative prolinases (pepr1 and pepr2) from lactobacillus  plantarum wcfs1: occurrence of two isozymes with structural similarity and different catalytic properties.
AB  == two putative prolinases (pepr1 and pepr2) of lactobacillus plantarum wcsf1 share  48.5% amino acid sequence identity (55.5% at the dna level); however, pepr1 exhibits over 80% identity at the protein level with other lactobacilli prolinases while pepr2 exhibits only 51% or less identity. in this study, the putative genes were overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified to gel electrophoretic homogeneity, and then characterized. purified pepr1 and pepr2 hydrolysed pro-xaa dipeptide substrates at similar rates, proving their nature as prolinases. structural analyses using circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, gel filtration, and molecular modelling revealed that the two prolinases have similar structural characteristics: high beta-sheet content, homotetrameric structure, and similar folding to the pepi/pepl/pepr peptidase family. however, kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of pepr1 and pepr2 indicated  differences in many aspects: optimum temperatures (25 and 30 degrees c, respectively), optimum ph (ph7.5 and 8.0, respectively), substrate specificities  (high stringency of pepr2), kinetic parameters, and thermal stability (29 and 48  degrees c, respectively). also, these prolinases behaved differently towards inhibitor treatments, suggesting structural and/or functional differences in their active sites. differences in the two prolinases would contribute to a diversity of catalytic activities, so that they work together cooperatively and complementarily to hydrolyse proline-containing peptides with broader specificity, working ph, working temperature, and higher efficiency, thus allowing adaptation to a wider range of environments.

TI  == characterization of glutamate decarboxylase from lactobacillus plantarum and its  c-terminal function for the ph dependence of activity.
AB  == the gadb gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase (gad) from lactobacillus plantarum was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant enzyme exhibited maximal activity at 40 degrees c and ph 5.0. the 3d model structure of l. plantarum gad proposed that its c-terminal region (ile454-thr468) may play an important role in the ph dependence of catalysis. accordingly, c-terminally truncated (delta3 and delta11 residues) mutants were generated and their enzyme activities compared with that of the wild-type enzyme at different ph values. unlike the wild-type gad, the mutants showed pronounced catalytic activity in a broad ph range of 4.0-8.0, suggesting that the c-terminal region is involved in the ph dependence of gad activity. therefore, this study may provide effective target regions for engineering ph dependence of gad activity, thereby meeting industrial demands for the production of gamma-aminobutyrate in a broad range of  ph values.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == antioxidant and antibacterial activities of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 and lactobacillus plantarum r315.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antioxidant and antibacterial  activities of exopolysaccharide (eps) from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 (b-eps) and lactobacillus plantarum r315 (l-eps). the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph)-radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical-scavenging, and superoxide radical-scavenging abilities were measured to evaluate antioxidant activity. inhibition of erythrocyte hemolysis and lipid peroxidation was also measured. both b-eps and l-eps had strong scavenging ability against dpph and superoxide radicals at high concentration. the inhibitory effect of b-eps on erythrocyte hemolysis was stronger than that of l-eps in a concentration range from 0.30 to 1.00 mg/ml, whereas the hydroxyl scavenging ability of l-eps (39.15 +/- 0.58%) was significantly higher than that of 0.15 mg/ml ascorbic acid (24.33 +/- 1.17%)  and b-eps (17.89 +/- 3.30%) at 0.10 mg/ml. the inhibition of lipid peroxidation of 0.50 mg/ml b-eps and l-eps was 13.48 +/- 1.74% and 12.43 +/- 0.51%, respectively, values lower than that of ascorbic acid at the same concentration (23.20 +/- 1.41%). furthermore, all these abilities were enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner. agar diffusion assay showed that both eps exhibited antibacterial activities against tested pathogens such as cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphyloccocus aureus, candida albicans, bacillus cereus, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella sonnei at 300 mug/ml. in conclusion, both eps have antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and could have applications in the food industry.

TI  == overexpression of the lactobacillus plantarum peptidoglycan biosynthesis mura2 gene increases the tolerance of escherichia coli to alcohols and enhances ethanol production.
AB  == a major challenge in producing chemicals and biofuels is to increase the tolerance of the host organism to toxic products or byproducts. an escherichia coli strain with superior ethanol and more generally alcohol tolerance was identified by screening a library constructed by randomly integrating lactobacillus plantarum genomic dna fragments into the e. coli chromosome via cre-lox recombination. sequencing identified the inserted dna fragment as the mura2 gene and its upstream intergenic 973-bp sequence, both coded on the negative genomic dna strand. overexpression of this mura2 gene and its upstream 973-bp sequence significantly enhanced ethanol tolerance in both e. coli ec100 and wild type e. coli mg1655 strains by 4.1-fold and 2.0-fold compared to control strains, respectively. tolerance to n-butanol and i-butanol in e. coli mg1655 was increased by 1.85-fold and 1.91-fold, respectively. we show that the intergenic 973-bp sequence contains a native promoter for the mura2 gene along with a long 5' utr (286 nt) on the negative strand, while a noncoding, small rna, named mura2s, is expressed off the positive strand. mura2s is expressed in e. coli and  may interact with mura2, but it does not affect mura2's ability to enhance alcohol tolerance in e. coli. overexpression of mura2 with its upstream region in the ethanologenic e. coli ko11 strain significantly improved ethanol production in cultures that simulate the industrial melle-boinot fermentation process.

TI  == production and characterization of a tributyrin esterase from lactobacillus plantarum suitable for cheese lipolysis.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that can be found during cheese ripening. lipolysis of milk triacylglycerols to free fatty acids during cheese ripening has fundamental consequences on cheese flavor. in the present study, the gene lp_1760, encoding a putative esterase or lipase, was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) and the overproduced lp_1760 protein was biochemically characterized. lp_1760 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids from c2 to c16, with a preference for p-nitrophenyl butyrate. on triglycerides, lp_1760 showed higher activity on tributyrin than on triacetin. although optimal conditions for activity were 45 degrees c and ph 7, lp_1760 retains activity under conditions commonly found during cheese making and ripening. the lp_1760 showed more than 50% activity at 5 degrees c and exhibited  thermal stability at high temperatures. enzymatic activity was strongly inhibited by sodium dodecyl sulfate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. the lp_1760 tributyrin esterase showed high activity in the presence of nacl, lactic acid, and calcium chloride. the results suggest that lp_1760 might be a useful tributyrin esterase to be used in cheese manufacturing.

TI  == inhibitory effect of plantaricin peptides (pln e/f and j/k) against escherichia coli.
AB  == plantaricins are small bioactive peptides produced by lactobacillus plantarum strains that exhibit significant antimicrobial activity against closely-related gram-positive bacteria, including food spoilage organisms. in comparison, bacteriocins including plantaricins, are usually less effective against gram-negative organisms. in this study, we demonstrate that heterologously expressed and purified plantaricins, pln e, -f, -j, and -k when tested against gram negative model organism escherichia coli k-12 were highly effective under certain conditions. the apparent tolerance of gram-negative members to these peptides has been explained on the basis of the presence of the outer membrane (om) that acts as a protective barrier. we have shown that agents and/or conditions that destabilize om of e. coli k-12, make it susceptible to plantaricin peptides. in order to further strengthen this conclusion, an om lipoprotein-defective lpp mutant strain of e. coli k-12 was also studied and compared. a significant loss of cell viability both in terms of cfu/ml as well as with live-dead dual staining combined with flow cytometry, could be demonstrated  with the lpp mutant in comparison to the wild type strain. the results indicate that plantaricins can inhibit gram-negative bacteria if the outer-membrane is weakened and it can be used in preservation of food with the help of some food-grade chelating agents.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

AB  == due to the increasing interest for healthy foods, the feasibility of using fresh-cut fruits to vehicle probiotic microorganisms is arising scientific interest. with this aim, the survival of probiotic lactic acid bacteria, belonging to lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum species, was monitored on artificially inoculated pineapple pieces throughout storage. the main nutritional, physicochemical, and sensorial parameters of minimally processed pineapples were monitored. finally, probiotic lactobacillus were further investigated for their antagonistic effect against listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli o157:h7 on pineapple plugs. our results show that at eight days of storage, the concentration of l. plantarum and l. fermentum on pineapples pieces ranged between 7.3 and 6.3 log cfu g(-1), respectively, without affecting  the final quality of the fresh-cut pineapple. the antagonistic assays indicated that l. plantarum was able to inhibit the growth of both pathogens, while l. fermentum was effective only against l. monocytogenes. this study suggests that both l. plantarum and l. fermentum could be successfully applied during processing of fresh-cut pineapples, contributing at the same time to inducing a protective effect against relevant foodborne pathogens.

TI  == assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  == probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., and oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. the assays included two probiotic reference strains (lactobacillus  plantarum clc 17 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716). the lactobacillus and pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/l of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and  were capable of surviving at low ph values (ph 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. the ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. adhesion levels of enological lab to caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. in particular, pediococcus pentosaceus cial-86 showed a  high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against e. coli cial-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine lab strain as a potential probiotic.

AB  == the microbiota associated with spontaneous fermentation of vegetables in a saline substrate may represent an important group of bacteria in the food industry. in this work, the lactic acid bacteria (lab) weissella cibaria, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paraplantarum, and leuconostoc citreum were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. in addition, entophytic bacteria such as pantoea eucalypti, pantoea anthophila, enterobacter cowanii, and enterobacter  asburiae were detected, but they were irrelevant for the fermentation process and were inhibited after 12 h of fermentation when the ph decreased from 6.5 to 4.9.  moreover, 2 species of yeast were isolated and identified as hanseniaspora pseudoguilliermondii and kodamaea ohmeri by their partial 26s rrna gene sequence. the growth of lab was evaluated at different sodium chloride contents. l. citreum was the most halotolerant species followed by l. plantarum and w. cibaria with a  concentration index to obtain a 50% population reduction (ic(50)) of 7.2%, 6.6%,  and 5.2%, respectively. furthermore, the growth of lab and escherichia coli o157:h7 was evaluated in the presence of the main phenylpropanoids from chilli peppers such as p-coumaric and ferulic acid. it was determined that lab can grow  in both acids at 4 mm, unlike e. coli o157:h7, whose growth is inhibited in the presence of these acids.

TI  == exploring the heterologous genomic space for building, stepwise, complex, multicomponent tolerance to toxic chemicals.
AB  == modern bioprocessing depends on superior cellular traits, many stemming from unknown genes and gene interactions. tolerance to toxic chemicals is such an industrially important complex trait, which frequently limits the economic feasibility of producing commodity chemicals and biofuels. chemical tolerance encompasses both improved cell viability and growth under chemical stress. building upon the success of our recently reported semisynthetic stress response  system expressed off plasmid phsp (heat shock protein), we probed the genomic space of the solvent tolerant lactobacillus plantarum to identify genetic determinants that impart solvent tolerance in combination with phsp. using two targeted enrichments, one for superior viability and one for better growth under  ethanol stress, we identified several beneficial heterologous dna determinants that act synergistically with phsp. in separate strains, a 209% improvement in survival and an 83% improvement in growth over previously engineered strains based on phsp were thus generated. we then developed a composite phenotype of improved growth and survival by combining the identified l. plantarum genetic fragments. this demonstrates the concept for a sequential, iterative assembly strategy for building multigenic traits by exploring the synergistic effects of genetic determinants from a much broader genomic space. the best performing strain produced a 3.7-fold improved survival under 8% ethanol stress, as well as  a 32% increase in growth under 4% ethanol. this strain also shows significantly improved tolerance to n-butanol. improved solvent production is rarely examined in tolerance engineering studies. here, we show that our system significantly improves ethanol productivity in a melle-boinot-like fermentation process.

TI  == evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  == the suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. a variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enteriditis, candida tropicalis or zygosaccharomyces rouxii and co2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (don whitely r.a.b.i.t.) system. the majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced  a detectable growth signal. the linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (r(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. this initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.

TI  == probiotic assessment of enterococcus durans 6hl and lactococcus lactis 2hl isolated from vaginal microflora.
AB  == forty-five lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from the vaginal specimens of healthy fertile women, and the identities of the bacteria were confirmed by sequencing of their 16s rdna genes. among these bacteria, only four isolates were able to resist and survive in low ph, bile salts and simulated in vitro digestion conditions. lactococcus lactis 2hl, enterococcus durans 6hl, lactobacillus acidophilus 36yl and lactobacillus plantarum 5bl showed the best resistance to these conditions. these strains were evaluated further to assess their ability to adhere to human intestinal caco-2 cells. lactococcus lactis 2hl and e. durans 6hl were the most adherent strains. in vitro tests under neutralized ph proved the antimicrobial activity of both strains. results revealed that the growth of escherichia coli o26, staphylococcus aureus and shigella flexneri was suppressed  by both lab strains. the antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that these strains were sensitive to all nine antibiotics: vancomycin, tetracycline, ampicillin, penicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfamethoxazole and chloramphenicol. these data suggest that e. durans 6hl and lactococcus lactis 2hl could be examined further for their useful properties and could be developed  as new probiotics.

TI  == lactulose and lactobacillus plantarum, a potential complementary synbiotic to control postweaning colibacillosis in piglets.
AB  == the potential of a prebiotic oligosaccharide lactulose, a probiotic strain of lactobacillus plantarum, or their synbiotic combination to control postweaning colibacillosis in pigs was evaluated using an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88 oral challenge. seventy-two weanlings were fed four diets: a control diet (ctr), that diet supplemented with l. plantarum (2 x 10(10) cfu . day(-1)) (lpn), that diet supplemented with 10 g . kg(-1) lactulose (lac), or a combination of the two treatments (syn). after 7 days, the pigs were orally challenged. six pigs per treatment were euthanized on days 6 and 10 postchallenge (pc). inclusion of lactulose improved the average daily gain (adg) (p < 0.05) and increased lactobacilli (p < 0.05) and the percentage of butyric acid (p < 0.02) in the colon. an increase in the ileum villous height (p < 0.05) and a reduction  of the pig major acute-phase protein (pig-map) in serum (p < 0.01) were observed  also. the inclusion of the probiotic increased numbers of l. plantarum bacteria in the ileum and colon (p < 0.05) and in the total lactobacilli in the colon and  showed a trend to reduce diarrhea (p = 0.09). the concentrations of ammonia in ileal and colonic digesta were decreased (p < 0.05), and the villous height (p <  0.01) and number of ileal goblet cells (p < 0.05) increased, at day 10 pc. a decrease in plasmatic tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) (p < 0.01) was also seen. the positive effects of the two additives were combined in the syn treatment, resulting in a complementary synbiotic with potential to be used to control postweaning colibacillosis.

TI  == probiotic abilities of riboflavin-overproducing lactobacillus strains: a novel promising application of probiotics.
AB  == the probiotic potential of lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum strains, capable of overproducing riboflavin, was investigated. the riboflavin production was quantified in co-cultures of lactobacilli and human intestinal epithelial cells, and the riboflavin overproduction ability was confirmed. when milk and yogurt were used as carrier matrices, l. plantarum and l. fermentum strains displayed a significant ability to survive through simulated gastrointestinal transit. adhesion was studied on both biotic and abiotic surfaces. both strains adhered strongly on caco-2 cells, negatively influenced the adhesion of escherichia coli o157:h7, and strongly inhibited the growth of three reference pathogenic microbial strains. resistance to major antibiotics and potential hemolytic activity were assayed. overall, this study reveals that these lactobacillus stains are endowed with promising probiotic properties and thus are candidates for the development of novel functional food which would be both enriched in riboflavin and induce additional health benefits, including a potential in situ riboflavin production, once the microorganisms colonize the host intestine.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid from lactobacillus plantarum inhibits the expression of platelet-activating factor receptor induced by staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid or escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide in human monocyte-like cells.
AB  == platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) plays an important role in bacterial infection and inflammation. we examined the effect of the bacterial cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (lps) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from lactobacillus plantarum (plta) and staphylococcus aureus (alta) on pafr expression in thp-1, a monocyte-like cell line. lps and alta, but not plta, significantly increased pafr expression, whereas priming with plta inhibited lpsmediated or alta-mediated pafr expression. expression of toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and 4, and cd14 increased with lps and alta treatments, but was inhibited by plta pretreatment. neutralizing antibodies against tlr2, tlr4, and cd14 showed that these receptors were important in lps-mediated or alta-mediated pafr expression. pafr expression is mainly regulated by the nuclear factor kappa b signaling pathway. blocking paf binding to pafr using a pafr inhibitor indicated  that lps-mediated or alta-mediated paf expression affected tnf-alpha production.  in the mouse small intestine, plta inhibited pafr, tlr2, and tlr4 expression that was induced by heat-labile toxin. our data suggested that plta has an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the expression of pafr that was induced by pathogenic ligands.

TI  == synthesis of conjugated linoleic acid by the linoleate isomerase complex in food-derived lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to assess strains of lactobacilli for their capacity to produce functional  fatty acid-conjugated linoleic acid. to assess the linoleate isomerase for cla production in the most efficient cla producer. methods and results: in this study, strains of food-derived lactobacilli were cultured in media with linoleic  acid and cla production was assessed. most of the selected strains produced cla at different levels, with lactobacillus plantarum zs2058 being the most efficient cla producer converting over 50% of linoleic acid to c9, t11-cla and t9, t11-cla. some intermediates 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid, 10-oxo-cis-12-octadecenoic acid and 10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic acid were determined via gc-ms. the genes coding the multicomponent linoleate isomerase containing myosin-cross-reactive antigen, short-chain dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase and acetoacetate decarboxylase for cla production in lact. plantarum zs2058 were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. with the mixture of recombinant e. coli, c9, t11-cla and three kinds of intermediates were produced from linoleic acid, which were in line with those in the lactobacilli. conclusions: the ability for cla production by lactobacilli exhibited variation.  lactobacillus plantarum and lact. bulgaricus were the most efficient producers in the selected strains. lact. plantarum zs2058 converted linoleic acid to clas with 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid, 10-oxo-cis-12-octadecenoic acid and 10-oxo-trans-11-octadecenoic acid as intermediates. the multiple-step reactions for cla production catalysed by multicomponent linoleate isomerase in lact. plantarum zs2058 were confirmed successfully. significance and impact of the study: multicomponent linoleate isomerase provides important results for the illustration of the mechanism for cla production in lactic acid bacteria. food-derived lactobacilli with cla production ability offers novel opportunities  for functional foods development.

AB  == in situ extractive fermentation was used to produce 4-vinyl derivatives from hydroxycinnamic acids extracted from corn cobs by recombinant escherichia coli cells expressing lactobacillus plantarum phenolic acid descarboxylase (pad) gene. this microorganism mainly produced 4-vinylphenol (4vp) from p-coumaric acid (p-ca). in the first study , we observed that the concentrations of 4vp are higher than 1g/l which had a negative impact on decarboxylation of p-ca to 4vp by recombinant e. coli cells. because of this, and in order to improve the downstream process, a two-phase aqueous-organic solvent system was developed. the results of the extractive fermentation indicated that it was possible to use hydrolyzates as aqueous phase to bioproduce 4vp, and recover simultaneously the product in the organic phase containing hexane. the detoxification of pre-treated corn cob alkaline hydrolyzate improved 4vp production up to 1003.5mg/l after 24h  fermentation (qp=41.813mg/lh). additionally, preliminary experiments using cells  immobilized in calcium alginate showed to be a good system for the biotransform of p-ca to 4vp in extractive fermentation, although the process hindered partially the recovery of 4vp in the organic phase.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from infant faeces possess potent inhibitory activity against intestinal alpha- and beta-glucosidases suggesting anti-diabetic potential.
AB  == purpose: inhibitors of intestinal alpha-glucosidases are used therapeutically to  treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. bacteria such as actinoplanes sp. naturally produce potent alpha-glucosidase inhibitor compounds, including the most widely available drug acarbose. it is not known whether lactic acid bacteria (lab) colonising the human gut possess inhibitory potential against glucosidases. hence, the study was undertaken to screen labs having inherent alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory potential. methods: this study isolated, screened, identified and extracted lactobacillus strains (lb1-15) from human infant faecal  samples determining their inhibitory activity against intestinal maltase, sucrase, lactase and amylase. lactobacillus reference strains (ref1-7), a gram positive control (ctrl1) and two gram negative controls (ctrl2-3), were also analysed to compare activity. results: faecal isolates were identified by dna sequencing, with the majority identified as unique strains of lactobacillus plantarum. some strains (l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. casei and l. rhamnosus) had potent and broad spectrum inhibitory activities (up to 89%; p < 0.001; 500 mg/ml wet weight) comparable to acarbose (up to 88%; p < 0.001; 30 mg/ml). inhibitory activity was concentration-dependent and was freely available in the supernatant, and was not present in other bacterial genera (bifidobacterium bifidum and escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the potency and spectrum of inhibitory activity across strains of a single species (l. plantarum) differed substantially. some lactobacillus extracts had broader spectrum activities than acarbose, effectively inhibiting beta-glucosidase activity (lactase) as well as alpha-glucosidase activities (maltase, sucrase and  amylase). anti-diabetic potential was indicated by the fact that oral gavage with a l. rhamnosus extract (1 g/kg) was able to reduce glucose excursions (area under curve; 22%; p < 0.05) in rats during a carbohydrate challenge (starch; 2 g/kg). conclusion: these results definitively demonstrate that lactobacillus strains present in the human gut have alpha- and beta-glucosidase inhibitory activities and can reduce blood glucose responses in vivo. although the potential use of lab such as lactobacillus as a dietary supplement, medicinal food or biotherapeutic for diabetes is uncertain, such an approach might offer advantages over drug therapies in terms of broader spectrum activities and fewer unpleasant side effects. further characterisation of this bioactivity is warranted, and chronic studies should be undertaken in appropriate animal models or diabetic subjects.

TI  == soluble products of escherichia coli induce mitochondrial dysfunction-related sperm membrane lipid peroxidation which is prevented by lactobacilli.
AB  == unidentified soluble factors secreted by e. coli, a frequently isolated microorganism in genitourinary infections, have been reported to inhibit mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsim), motility and vitality of human spermatozoa. here we explore the mechanisms involved in the adverse impact of e.  coli on sperm motility, focusing mainly on sperm mitochondrial function and possible membrane damage induced by mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species (ros). furthermore, as lactobacilli, which dominate the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women, have been shown to exert anti-oxidant protective effects on spermatozoa, we also evaluated whether soluble products from these microorganisms could protect spermatozoa against the effects of e. coli. we assessed motility (by computer-aided semen analysis), deltapsim (with jc-1 dye by flow cytometry),  mitochondrial ros generation (with mitosox red dye by flow cytometry) and membrane lipid-peroxidation (with the fluorophore bodipy c11 by flow cytometry) of sperm suspensions exposed to e. coli in the presence and in the absence of a combination of 3 selected strains of lactobacilli (l. brevis, l. salivarius, l. plantarum). a transwell system was used to avoid direct contact between spermatozoa and microorganisms. soluble products of e. coli induced deltapsim loss, mitochondrial generation of ros and membrane lipid-peroxidation, resulting  in motility loss. soluble factors of lactobacilli prevented membrane lipid-peroxidation of e. coli-exposed spermatozoa, thus preserving their motility. in conclusion, sperm motility loss by soluble products of e. coli reflects a mitochondrial dysfunction-related membrane lipid-peroxidation. lactobacilli could protect spermatozoa in the presence of vaginal disorders, by preventing ros-induced membrane damage.

AB  == a wild-type, gram-positive, rod-shaped, endospore-forming and motile bacteria has been isolated from palm oil mill sludge in malaysia. molecular identification using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis indicated that the bacteria belonged to genus paenibacillus. with 97 % similarity to p. alvei (aug6), the isolate was designated as p. alvei an5. an antimicrobial compound was extracted from p. alvei an5-pelleted cells using 95 % methanol and was then lyophilized. precipitates were re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (pbs), producing an antimicrobial  crude extract (ace). the ace showed antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, escherichia coli atcc 29522, bacillus cereus atcc 14579 and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 8014. by using sp-sepharose cation exchange chromatography, sephadex g-25 gel filtration and tricine sds-page, the ace was purified, which produced a ~2-kda active band. sds-page and infrared (ir) spectroscopy indicated the proteinaceous nature of the antimicrobial compound in  the ace, and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and  de novo sequencing using an automatic, q-tof premier system detected a peptide with the amino acid sequence f-c-k-s-l-p-l-p-l-s-v-k (1,330.7789 da). this novel  peptide was designated as an5-2. the antimicrobial peptide exhibited stability from ph 3 to 12 and maintained its activity after being heated to 90 degrees c. it also remained active after incubation with denaturants (urea, sds and edta).

TI  == evaluation and functional characterization of a biosurfactant produced by lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194.
AB  == the study details the investigations on the ability of lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194, an isolate from kanjika, a rice-based ayurvedic fermented product, to produce biosurfactant. surfactant production, as a function of fermentation time, indicates that the maximum production occurred at 72 h under stationary conditions. isolation, partial purification, and characterization of the biosurfactant produced have been carried out, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) spectra demonstrated that biosurfactants were constituted by  protein and polysaccharide fractions, i.e., possessed the structure typical of glycoprotein, which is affected by the medium composition and the phase of growth of the biosurfactant-synthesizing strain. critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the biosurfactant was found to be 6 g l(-1). the emulsification index (ei), emulsification activity (ea), and emulsion stability (es) values of the biosurfactant have confirmed its emulsification property. aqueous fractions of the produced biosurfactant exhibited a significant antimicrobial activity against the food-borne pathogenic species: escherichia coli atcc 31705, e. coli mtcc 108, salmonella typhi, yersinia enterocolitica mtcc 859, and staphylococcus aureus f 722. more importantly, the biosurfactant from l. plantarum showed antiadhesive property against above food-borne pathogens. the results thus indicate the potential for developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of food contact surfaces and health-care prosthesis using these biosurfactants.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 co-cultured with different levels of pseudomonas fluorescens and lactobacillus plantarum on fresh beef.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different levels of pseudomonas fluorescens (10(2) and 10(6) log10 cfu/ml) and lactobacillus plantarum (10(2) and 10(4) log10 cfu/ml) on the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7 on beef loins. beef loins inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 and p. fluorescens were aerobically stored for 7 days at 4 masculinec, while those inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 and l. plantarum were vacuum packaged and stored  for 8 weeks at 4 masculinec. aerobic plate counts (apc), e. coli o157:h7 and either p. fluorescens or l. plantarum counts were determined at different storage intervals. for the aerobically packaged beef loins, e. coli o157:h7 was detected  throughout the 7 day storage period regardless of the p. fluorescens level in the inoculum. for the vacuum packaged beef loins, similar inoculum levels of e. coli  o157:h7 and l. plantarum allowed e. coli o157:h7 to survive until week 5 of storage, while a higher inoculum level of l. plantarum inhibited e. coli o157:h7  from week 3. once fresh beef has been contaminated with e. coli o157:h7, the level of p. fluorescens in the background flora does not inhibit its survival and growth. however, under vacuum storage, the application of l. plantarum as a biopreservative inhibits the survival of e. coli o157:h7 on beef. the higher the  level of l. plantarum in the system, the earlier the onset of the inhibition. farmers and abattoirs have to strengthen preventive strategies to eliminate contamination of beef carcasses with e. coli o157:h7.

TI  == lactobacillus reuteri and escherichia coli in the human gut microbiota may predict weight gain associated with vancomycin treatment.
AB  == background: antibiotics, used for 60 years to promote weight gain in animals, have been linked to obesity in adults and in children when administered during early infancy. lactobacillus reuteri has been linked to obesity and weight gain in children affected with kwashiorkor using ready-to-use therapeutic food. in contrast, escherichia coli has been linked with the absence of obesity. both of these bacteria are resistant to vancomycin. objectives and methods: we assessed vancomycin-associated weight and gut microbiota changes, and tested whether bacterial species previously linked with body mass index (bmi) predict weight gain at 1 year. all endocarditis patients treated with vancomycin or amoxicillin  in our center were included from january 2008 to december 2010. bacteroidetes, firmicutes, lactobacillus and methanobrevibacter smithii were quantified using real-time pcr on samples obtained during the 4-6 weeks antibiotic regimen. l. reuteri, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus, bifidobacterium animalis and e. coli were quantified on stool samples obtained during the first week of antibiotics. results: of the193 patients included in the study, 102 were treated with vancomycin and 91 with amoxicillin. vancomycin was associated with a 10% bmi increase (odds ratio (or) 14.1; 95% confidence interval (ci; 1.03-194); p=0.047)  and acquired obesity (4/41 versus 0/56, p=0.01). in patients treated with vancomycin, firmicutes, bacteroidetes and lactobacillus increased, whereas m. smithii decreased (p<0.05). the absence of e. coli was an independent predictor of weight gain (or=10.7; 95% ci (1.4-82.0); p=0.02). strikingly, a patient with an 18% bmi increase showed a dramatic increase of l. reuteri but no increase of e. coli. conclusion: the acquired obesity observed in patients treated with vancomycin may be related to a modulation of the gut microbiota rather than a direct antibiotic effect. l. reuteri, which is resistant to vancomycin and produces broad bacteriocins, may have an instrumental role in this effect.

TI  == role of surface layer collagen binding protein from indigenous lactobacillus plantarum 91 in adhesion and its anti-adhesion potential against gut pathogen.
AB  == human feacal isolates were ascertain as genus lactobacillus using specific primer lblma1/r16-1 and further identified as lactobacillus plantarum with species specific primers lpl-3/lpl-2. 25 l. plantarum strains were further assessed for hydrophobicity following the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons (math) method and colonization potentials based on their adherence to immobilized human collagen type-1. surface proteins were isolated from selected l. plantarum 91(lp91) strain. the purified collagen binding protein (cbp) protein was assessed for its  anti-adhesion activity against enteric escherichia coli 0157:h7 pathogen on immobilized collagen. four l. plantarum strains displayed high degree of hydrophobicity and significant adhesion to collagen. a 72 kda protein was purified which reduced 59.71% adhesion of e. coli 0157:h7 on immobilized collagen as compared to control well during adhesion assay. cbp protein is the major influencing factor in inhibition of e. coli 0157:h7 adhesion with extracellular matrix (ecm) components. hydrophobicity and adhesion potential are closely linked attributes precipitating in better colonization potential of the lactobacillus strains. cbp is substantiated as a crucial surface protein contributing in adhesion of lactobacillus strains. the study can very well be the platform for commercialization of indigenous probiotic strain once their functional attributes are clinically explored.

TI  == cloning and heterologous expression of plne, -f, -j and -k genes derived from soil metagenome and purification of active plantaricin peptides.
AB  == plantaricin gene-specific primers were used to obtain plne, -f, -j and -k structural gene amplicons from soil metagenome. these amplicons were cloned and expressed in pet32a (+) vector in escherichia coli bl21 (de3). plne, -f, -j and -k peptides were expressed as his-tagged-fusion proteins and were separated by ni(2+) -chelating affinity chromatography. the peptides were released from the fusion by enterokinase cleavage and separated from the carrier thioredoxin. the cleaved peptides were further analysed for antimicrobial activity and found to be active against listeria innocua nrrl b33314, micrococcus luteus mtcc 106 and lactic acid bacteria, such as enterococcus casseliflavus nrrl b3502, lactococcus  lactis lactis nrrl 1821, lactobacillus curvatus nrrl b4562 and lactobacillus plantarum nrrl b4496. e. coli has been successfully exploited as a host for heterologous expression with a significant yield of fused and cleaved peptides in the range of 8-12 and 1-1.5 mg/l of the culture, respectively. heterologous expression, therefore, can be used to overcome the constraints of low yield often reported from a native strain.

AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 25 (lp25) encapsulated into alginate/chitosan/alginate (aca) microcapsules (lp25-aca mcs) prepared by an extrusion methods were characterized to assess their efficacy in oral delivery. the particle sizes of lp25-aca mcs were 1.11 +/- 0.32 mm. the loading content of lp25 was 1.11 x 10(7)  colony forming unit (cfu)/microcapsule and encapsulation efficiency was above 98%. the viability of lp25 in aca mcs was more than 65% in simulated gastric fluid (sgf, ph 2.0) and 75% in simulated small intestinal fluid (sif, ph 7.2) up  to 2 h. encapsulated lp25 were completely released from lp25-aca mcs in sif and simulated colon fluid (scf, ph 6.0) within 12 h and 8 h respectively. the viability of lp25 in aca mcs till 5 weeks was above 58%, whereas viability of free lp25 stored at room temperature up to 5 weeks was zero. besides, lp25-aca mcs induced the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) from macrophages and dendritic cells showing the immunomodulatory effect of lp25. these findings demonstrate that the encapsulation of lp25 by aca is a suitable strategy for oral delivery of probiotics.

TI  == bacterial diversity in meconium of preterm neonates and evolution of their fecal  microbiota during the first month of life.
AB  == the establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce.  in this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including dgge and the human intestinal tract chip (hitchip) analysis of 16s rrna amplicons. culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study  of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. culture and hitchip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. bacilli and other firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples.  culture technique showed that staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that enterococcus, together with gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, escherichia fergusonii, klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. in addition, hitchip results showed the prevalence of  bacteria related to lactobacillus plantarum and streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to enterococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. this study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. our findings indicate that the presence of serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.

TI  == yeasts and lactic acid bacteria mixed-specie biofilm formation is a promising cell immobilization technology for ethanol fermentation.
AB  == we previously found that some saccharomyces cerevisiae and lactobacillus plantarum remarkably formed mixed-specie biofilm in a static co-culture and deduced that this biofilm had potential as immobilized cells. we investigated the application of mixed-specie biofilm formed by s. cerevisiae by4741 and l. plantarum hm23 for ethanol fermentation in repeated batch cultures. this mixed-specie biofilm was far abundantly formed and far resistant to washing compared with s. cerevisiae single biofilm. adopting mixed-specie biofilm formed  on cellulose beads as immobilized cells, we could produce enough ethanol from 10  or 20 % glucose during ten times repeated batch cultures for a duration of 10 days. cell numbers of s. cerevisiae and l. plantarum during this period were stable. in mixed-specie biofilm system, though ethanol production was slightly lower compared to s. cerevisiae single-culture system due to by-production of lactate, ph was stably maintained under ph 4 without artificial control suggesting high resistance to contamination. inoculated model contaminants, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, were excluded from the system in a short  time. from the above results, it was indicated that the mixed-specie biofilm of s. cerevisiae and l. plantarum was a promising immobilized cell for ethanol fermentation for its ethanol productivity and robustness due to high resistance to contamination.

TI  == strain-specific probiotics properties of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis isolates from brazilian food products.
AB  == a total of 234 lab isolates from brazilian food products were initially screened  for their ability to survive at ph 2.0. fifty one of the isolates survived and were selected. they were characterized by phenotypic methods, rep-pcr and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus fermentum (34 isolates), lactobacillus plantarum (10) and lactobacillus brevis (7). based on being either highly tolerant to bile, showing an ability for auto-aggregation and/or hydrophobic properties, one l. fermentum (ch58), three l. plantarum (ch3,  ch41 and sau96) and two l. brevis (sau105 and ffc199) were selected. the highest  co-aggregation ability with escherichia coli was observed to l. plantarum ch41. l. brevis sau105 and ffc199 and l. fermentum ch58 exhibited antagonistic activity towards the pathogens listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 and l. brevis ffc199 showed adhesion ability to caco-2 cells (1.6, 1.1 and 0.9%, respectively) similar to the commercial probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (1.5%). they were able to increase the transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) of caco-2 cells over 24 h (p < 0.05). the present work showed that the probiotic characteristics were strain-specific and that the  isolates l. plantarum ch3 and ch41 (cocoa) and l. brevis ffc199 (cauim) exhibited potential probiotics properties.

TI  == uncovering the lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 gallate decarboxylase involved in tannin degradation.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium able to degrade tannins by the subsequent action of tannase and gallate decarboxylase enzymes. the gene encoding tannase had previously been identified, whereas the gene encoding gallate decarboxylase is unknown. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of gallic-acid induced l. plantarum extracts showed a  54-kda protein which was absent in the uninduced cells. this protein was identified as lp_2945, putatively annotated ubid. homology searches identified ubid-like genes located within three-gene operons which encoded the three subunits of nonoxidative aromatic acid decarboxylases. l. plantarum is the only bacterium in which the lpdc (lp_2945) gene and the lpdb and lpdd (lp_0271 and lp_0272) genes are separated in the chromosome. combination of extracts from recombinant escherichia coli cells expressing the lpdb, lpdc, and lpdc genes demonstrated that lpdc is the only protein required to yield gallate decarboxylase activity. however, the disruption of these genes in l. plantarum revealed that the lpdb and lpdc gene products are essential for gallate decarboxylase activity. similar to l. plantarum tannase, which exhibited activity only in esters derived from gallic and protocatechuic acids, purified his6-lpdc protein from e. coli showed decarboxylase activity against gallic and protocatechuic acids. in contrast to the tannase activity, gallate decarboxylase  activity is widely present among lactic acid bacteria. this study constitutes the first genetic characterization of a gallate decarboxylase enzyme and provides new insights into the role of the different subunits of bacterial nonoxidative aromatic acid decarboxylases.

AB  == thiamin diphosphate (thdp)-dependent enzymes play vital roles in cellular metabolism in all kingdoms of life. in previous kinetic and structural studies, a communication between the active centers in terms of a negative cooperativity had been suggested for some but not all thdp enzymes, which typically operate as functional dimers. to further underline this hypothesis and to test its universality, we investigated the binding of substrate analogue methyl acetylphosphonate (map) to three different thdp-dependent enzymes acting on substrate pyruvate, namely, the escherichia coli e1 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, e. coli acetohydroxyacid synthase isoenzyme i, and the lactobacillus plantarum pyruvate oxidase using isothermal titration calorimetry.  the results unambiguously show for all three enzymes studied that only one active center of the functional dimers accomplishes covalent binding of the substrate analogue, supporting the proposed alternating sites reactivity as a common feature of all thdp enzymes and resolving the recent controversy in the field.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria convert glucosinolates to nitriles efficiently yet differently from enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == glucosinolates from the genus brassica can be converted into bioactive compounds  known to induce phase ii enzymes, which may decrease the risk of cancers. conversion via hydrolysis is usually by the brassica enzyme myrosinase, which can be inactivated by cooking or storage. we examined the potential of three beneficial bacteria, lactobacillus plantarum kw30, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis kf147, and escherichia coli nissle 1917, and known myrosinase-producer enterobacter cloacae to catalyze the conversion of glucosinolates in broccoli extract. enterobacteriaceae consumed on average 65% glucoiberin and 78% glucoraphanin, transforming them into glucoiberverin and glucoerucin, respectively, and small amounts of iberverin nitrile and erucin nitrile. the lactic acid bacteria did not accumulate reduced glucosinolates, consuming all at  30-33% and transforming these into iberverin nitrile, erucin nitrile, sulforaphane nitrile, and further unidentified metabolites. adding beneficial bacteria to a glucosinolate-rich diet may increase glucosinolate transformation,  thereby increasing host exposure to bioactives.

TI  == antibacterial activity and probiotic potential of lactobacillus plantarum hkn01:  a new insight into the morphological changes of antibacterial compound-treated escherichia coli by electron microscopy.
AB  == among several bacteria examined, an antibacterial-producing lactobacillus strain  with probiotic characteristics was selected and identified based on 16s rrna gene sequencing. subsequent purification and mode of action of the antibacterial compounds on target cells including e. coli were investigated. maximum production of the antibacterial compound was recorded at 18 h incubation at 30 degrees c. interestingly, antibacterial activity remained unchanged after heating at 121 degrees c for 45 min, 24 h storage in temperature range of 70 degrees c to room temperature, and 15 min exposure to uv light, and it was stable in the ph of range 2-10. the active compounds were inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, indicating their proteinaceous nature, and, therefore, referred to as bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. isolation and partial purification of the effective agent was done by performing ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration chromatography. the molecular mass of the gfc-purified active compound (~3 kda) was determined by tris-tricine sds-page. to predict the mechanisms of action, transmission electron microscopy (tem) analysis of ultrathin sections of  e. coli before and after antibacterial treatment was carried out. tem analysis of antibacterial compounds-treated e. coli demonstrated that the completely altered  bacteria appear much darker compared with the less altered bacteria, suggesting a change in the cytoplasmic composition. there were also some membrane-bound convoluted structures visible within the completely altered bacteria, which could be attributed to the response of the e. coli to the treatment with the antibacterial compound. according to the in vivo experiments oral administration  of l. plantarum hkn01 resulted in recovery of infected balb/c mice with salmonella enterica ser. typhimurium.

AB  == 2,5-diketo-d-gluconic acid reductase (2,5-dkg reductase) catalyses the reduction  of 2,5-diketo-d-gluconic acid (2,5-dkg) to 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (2-klg), a direct precursor (lactone) of l-ascorbic acid (vitamin c). this reaction is an essential step in the biocatalytic production of the food supplement vitamin c from d-glucose or d-gluconic acid. as 2,5-dkg reductase is usually produced recombinantly, it is of interest to establish an efficient process for 2,5-dkg reductase production that also satisfies food safety requirements. in the present study, three recently described food grade variants of the lactobacillales based  expression systems psip (lactobacillus plantarum) and nice (lactococcus lactis) were evaluated with regard to their effictiveness to produce 2,5-dkg reductase from corynebacterium glutamicum. our results indicate that both systems are suitable for 2,5-dkg reductase expression. maximum production yields were obtained with lb. plantarum/psip609 by ph control at 6.5. with 262 u per litre of broth, this represents the highest heterologous expression level so far reported  for 2,5-dkg reductase from c. glutamicum. accordingly, lb. plantarum/psip609 might be an interesting alternative to escherichia coli expression systems for industrial 2,5-dkg reductase production.

TI  == construction of homologous and heterologous synthetic sucrose utilizing modules and their application for carotenoid production in recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == sucrose is one of the most promising carbon sources for industrial fermentation.  we expressed synthetic modules expressing genes of the pep-pts and non-pts pathways in escherichia coli k12 for comparison. we selected pep-pts pathway genes of lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus xylosus and non-pts pathway genes of sucrose-utilizing (scr(+)) e. coli ec3132. switchable scr(+) modules expressing e. coli ec3132 non-pts genes conferred better sucrose-utilizing ability on scr(-)e. coli k12 than e. coli ec3132. scr(+) modules expressing s. xylosus pep-pts genes conferred a sucrose-utilizing ability on e. coli k12. among l. plantarum pep-pts genes, saca(lp) and sack(lp) were functional in e. coli k12. csca(ec)-cscb(ec)-csck(ec) (non-pep-pts module) or scra(sx)-saca(lp)-sack(lp) (pep-pts module) was introduced to a diapolycopene-producing e. coli strain. in both scr(+)e. coli k12, the sucrose-utilizing ability of the modules was not affected by diapolycopene formation, indicating that the modular scr(+) systems could be employed for developing sustainable bioprocesses using sucrose.

TI  == behavior of escherichia coli o26:h11 in the presence of hafnia alvei in a model cheese ecosystem.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the capacity of three hafnia strains to inhibit the growth of an e. coli strain o26:h11 in an uncooked pressed model cheese, in the presence or absence of a microbial consortium added to mimic a cheese microbial community. inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml into pasteurized milk without hafnia, the e. coli o26:h11 strain reached 5 log cfu/g during cheese-making and survived at levels of 4 to 5 log cfu/g beyond 40 days. inoculated into milk at 6 log cfu/ml, all three tested hafnia strains (h. alvei b16 and ha, h. paralvei 920) reached values close to 8 log cfu/g and reduced e. coli o26:h11 counts in cheese on day 1 by 0.8 to 1.4 log cfu/g compared to cheeses inoculated with e. coli o26:h11 and the microbial consortium only. the hafnia strains slightly reduced counts of enterococcus faecalis (~-0.5 log from day 1) and promoted lactobacillus plantarum growth (+0.2 to 0.5 log from day 8) in cheese. they produced small amounts of putrescine (~1.3 mmol/kg) and cadaverine (~0.9 mmol/kg) in cheese after 28 days, and did not affect levels of volatile aroma compounds. further work on h. alvei strain b16 showed that e. coli o26:h11, inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml, was inhibited by h. alvei b16 inoculated at  6 log cfu/ml and not at 4.5 log cfu/ml. the inhibition was associated neither with lower ph values in cheese after 6 or 24h, nor with higher concentrations of  lactic acid. enhanced concentrations of acetic acid on day 1 in cheese inoculated with h. alvei b16 (4 to 11 mmol/kg) could not fully explain the reduction in e. coli o26:h11 growth. a synergistic interaction between h. alvei b16 and the microbial consortium, resulting in an additional 0.7-log reduction in e. coli o26:h11 counts, was observed from day 8 in model cheeses made from pasteurized milk. however, e. coli o26:h11 survived better during ripening in model cheeses made from raw milk than in those made from pasteurized milk, but this was not associated with an increase in ph values. in vitro approaches are required to investigate the mechanisms and causative agents of this interaction. h. alvei b16 appears to be a promising strain for reducing e. coli o26:h11 growth in cheese, as part of a multi-hurdle approach.

TI  == recombinant expression, purification and characterisation of the native glutamate racemase from lactobacillus plantarum nc8.
AB  == glutamic acid racemases (muri, e.c. 5.1.1.3) catalyse the racemisation of l- and  d-glutamic acid. muris are essential enzymes for bacterial cell wall synthesis, which requires d-glutamic acid as an indispensable building block. therefore these enzymes are suitable targets for antimicrobial drugs as well as for the potential design of auxotrophic selection markers. a high expression system in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) was constructed to produce and characterise the biochemical properties of the muri from lactobacillus plantarum nc8. in a 4-l-bioreactor cultivation, 3266 nkat(d-glu)/mg(protein) of specific enzyme activity was produced. the recombinant, tag-free murl was purified by an innovative affinity chromatography method using l-glutamic acid as the relevant docking group, followed by an anion exchange chromatography step (purification factor 9.2, yield 11%). this two-step purification strategy resulted in a murl sample with a specific activity of 34,060 nkat(d-glu)/mg(protein), comprising a single protein band in sds-page. the purified murl possessed an assay temperature optimum of 50 degrees c, but it was not stable at this temperature. the half-lives of the purified murl were 162 h at 20 degrees c and only 1.9 h at 40 degrees c. the murl activity was maximum between ph 7 and 10, resulting in a maximal half-life of 287 h at ph 7. only d- and l-glutamic acid were recognised as substrates for the murl with similar k(cat)/k(m) ratios of 3.6s(-1)/mm for each enantiomer.

AB  == the present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from naturally fermented olives and select candidates to  be used as probiotic starters for the improvement of the traditional fermentation process and the production of newly added value functional foods. seventy one (71) lactic acid bacterial strains (17 leuconostoc mesenteroides, 1 ln. pseudomesenteroides, 13 lactobacillus plantarum, 37 lb. pentosus, 1 lb. paraplantarum, and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) isolated from table olives were screened for their probiotic potential. lb. rhamnosus gg and lb. casei shirota were used as reference strains. the in vitro tests included survival in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, antimicrobial activity (against listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7), caco-2 surface adhesion, resistance to 9 antibiotics and haemolytic activity. three (3)  lb. pentosus, 4 lb. plantarum and 2 lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei strains demonstrated the highest final population (>8 log cfu/ml) after 3 h of exposure at low ph. the majority of the tested strains were resistant to bile salts even after 4 h of exposure, while 5 lb. plantarum and 7 lb. pentosus strains exhibited partial bile salt hydrolase activity. none of the strains inhibited the growth of the pathogens tested. variable efficiency to adhere to caco-2 cells was observed. this was the same regarding strains' susceptibility towards different antibiotics. none of the strains exhibited beta-haemolytic activity. as a whole,  4 strains of lb. pentosus, 3 strains of lb. plantarum and 2 strains of lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei were found to possess desirable in vitro probiotic properties similar to or even better than the reference probiotic strains lb. casei shirota and lb. rhamnosus gg. these strains are good candidates for further investigation both with in vivo studies to elucidate their potential health benefits and in olive fermentation processes to assess their technological performance as novel probiotic starters.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir protects vero cells from cytotoxicity by type-ii shiga toxin from escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == kefir is a fermented-milk beverage originating and widely consumed in the caucasus as well as in eastern europe and is a source of bacteria with potential  probiotic properties. enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli producing shiga toxin is commonly associated with food-transmitted diseases; the most prevalent serotype causing epidemics is esch. coli o157:h7. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonism of lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir against the action on vero cells of supernatants of the esch. coli o157:h7 strain 69160 expressing the type-ii shiga toxin (stx2) and to study the role of the lactobacillus cell wall in that inhibition. spent culture supernatants of esch. coli o157:h7 strain 69160 led to cytotoxic effects on cultured eukaryotic cells as evidenced by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide-cleavage assay or by lactate-dehyrogenase release. lb. plantarum cidca 83114 reduced the cytotoxic activity of stx present in strain-69160 supernatants, and this protection was markedly higher than those of lactobacillus kefir cidca 83113 and 8348 and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cidca 333. this antagonism of cytotoxicity was mimicked by lb. plantarum cell walls but was reduced after heating or protease treatments, thus indicating a protein or peptide as being involved in the protection mechanism. the cell surface of the lactobacilli bound the subunit b of stx thereby decreasing the cytotoxicity. these interactions could constitute the  first step in preventing the damage induced by esch. coli o157:h7 supernatants, thus representing a valuable means of potentially mitigating the noxious effects  of this food pathogen.

TI  == differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.

TI  == "direct cloning in lactobacillus plantarum: electroporation with non-methylated plasmid dna enhances transformation efficiency and makes shuttle vectors obsolete".
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) play an important role in agricultural as  well as industrial biotechnology. development of improved lab strains using e.g.  library approaches is often limited by low transformation efficiencies wherefore  one reason could be differences in the dna methylation patterns between the escherichia coli intermediate host for plasmid amplification and the final lab host. in the present study, we examined the influence of dna methylation on transformation efficiency in lab and developed a direct cloning approach for lactobacillus plantarum cd033. therefore, we propagated plasmid pcd256 in e. coli strains with different dam/dcm-methylation properties. the obtained plasmid dna was purified and transformed into three different l. plantarum strains and a selection of other lab species. results: best transformation efficiencies were obtained using the strain l. plantarum cd033 and non-methylated plasmid dna. thereby we achieved transformation efficiencies of ~ 10(9) colony forming units/mug dna in l. plantarum cd033 which is in the range of transformation efficiencies reached with e. coli. based on these results, we directly transformed recombinant expression vectors received from pcr/ligation reactions into l. plantarum cd033, omitting plasmid amplification in e. coli. also this approach was successful and yielded a sufficient number of recombinant clones. conclusions: transformation efficiency of l. plantarum cd033 was drastically increased when non-methylated plasmid dna was used, providing the possibility to  generate expression libraries in this organism. a direct cloning approach, whereby ligated pcr-products where successfully transformed directly into l. plantarum cd033, obviates the construction of shuttle vectors containing e. coli-specific sequences, as e.g. a colei origin of replication, and makes amplification of these vectors in e. coli obsolete. thus, plasmid constructs become much smaller and occasional structural instability or mutagenesis during e. coli propagation is excluded. the results of our study provide new genetic tools for l. plantarum which will allow fast, forward and systems based genetic engineering of this species.

TI  == vitamin c inhibits staphylococcus aureus growth and enhances the inhibitory effect of quercetin on growth of escherichia coli in vitro.
AB  == quercetin is a natural flavonoid possessing a number of health beneficial effects. its bioactivity is restricted by low solubility and sensitivity to oxidative degradation, factors that are often ignored in laboratory studies. we studied the antimicrobial effects of quercetin on staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum at concentrations at which it is soluble and investigated how the antioxidant vitamin c modulates these activities. s. aureus was the most sensitive of the studied bacteria. after 12 hours of culturing, 90 microm quercetin decreased the growth of s. aureus to 75 % of the value for a control culture. 1 mm vitamin c combined with 90 microm quercetin diminished the growth of s. aureus drastically to 3 % of that of the control culture supplemented with vitamin c only. interestingly, vitamin c by itself inhibited the growth of s. aureus as well, and 5 mm vitamin c inhibited growth completely. the growth inhibition of e. coli was slightly but significantly better in the presence of both quercetin and vitamin c than in the  presence of quercetin alone. probiotic l. plantarum was resistant to quercetin in the presence and absence of vitamin c. enhancement of quercetin's antimicrobial activity by vitamin c is partly explained by the stabilizing effect of vitamin c  on quercetin. even though the acidity of vitamin c contributes to the inhibition  of s. aureus growth, neutralized vitamin c also inhibits the growth efficiently even without quercetin. our results suggest that vitamin c affects the metabolism of s. aureus and that these changes are likely to result in the observed growth inhibition. although vitamin c itself is a powerful antioxidant, its aerobic metabolism increases oxidative stress on bacterial cells. vitamin c may therefore be a safe and natural alternative for restricting the growth of s. aureus when non-toxicity is required.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == inhibition of fe-induced colon oxidative stress by lactobacilli in mice.
AB  == iron (fe) can promote hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) and hydroxyl radical generation in the colonic surface and promote growth of fe-dependent bacteria. some lactobacillus strains are resistant to oxygen free-radicals, allowing them to survive in a fe-modulated mucosal environment and influence colon microbial ecology and redox state. here, we investigated the capacity of lactobacilli with  different antioxidant abilities to modify the bacterial profile and prevent oxidative stress in the colon of fe-overloaded mice. survival time of lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg (lgg) in the presence of h(2)o(2) and hydroxyl radical was significantly longer compared with the mid- and non-antioxidative strains, lactobacillus paracasei fn032 and lactobacillus plantarum fn001, respectively. different lactobacillus strains are specific in free-radical scavenging activities of their cell-free extracts, which increased to varying extent depending on strains when bacteria were exposed to simulated gastric and pancreatic juice. fe-overloaded mice showed increased colonic luminal ferrous fe  content, enterococcus and escherichia coli concentrations, mucosal malondialdehyde and free-radicals, and decreased mucosal total antioxidative capacity and oxidative enzymatic activity. translocation of endotoxin to the liver was also significantly increased (p < 0.05). lactobacilli inhibited ferrous fe accumulation, especially in lgg and fn032. lgg significantly inhibited the increase of colonic mucosal free-radicals and malondialdehyde content (p < 0.05). fn032 only inhibited malondialdehyde (p < 0.05). lgg and fn032 significantly inhibited increases in colonic enterococcus (p < 0.05). fn001 showed no significant antioxidative ability in vivo. the difference of these effects in vivo were well agreed with scavenging activities against reactive oxygen species  (ros) of simulated gastrointestinals fluid pretreated cells in vitro. in conclusion, ros scavenging activities was essential for lactobacillus to prevent  oxidative stress in vivo and inhibition of ros-producing bacterial growth and mucosal barrier injury.

TI  == assessment of the in vitro inhibitory activity of specific probiotic bacteria against different escherichia coli strains.
AB  == background: lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are often associated with health-promoting effects. these live microorganisms, defined as probiotics, are commonly consumed as part of fermented foods, such as yoghurt and fermented milks, or as dietary supplements. escherichia coli is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. as a part of the normal gut microbiota, this microorganism colonizes the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans within a few hours after birth. all  e. coli strains can produce a wide variety of biogenic amines responsible for potentially harmful systemic intoxications. enterohemorrhagic e. coli serotype o157:h7 is a pathotype of diarrhoeagenic strains with a large virulence plasmid po157 able to produce 1 or more shiga toxins. methods: the overall aim of this study was to determine the inhibitory effects of different strains of probiotics  on e. coli serotypes, including e. coli o157:h7 (cq9485). in particular, the antagonistic activity of 4 bifidobacterium strains (probiotical spa, italy) and 16 lactic acid bacteria, more specifically 14 lactobacillus spp. and 2 streptococcus spp., was assessed against selected e. coli biotypes (atcc 8739, atcc 10536, atcc 35218, and atcc 25922). the diarrhoeagenic serotype o157:h7 was  also tested. results: the experimental data collected demonstrated an in vitro significant inhibitory effect of 6 lactobacillus strains, namely l. rhamnosus lr04, l. rhamnosus lr06, l. plantarum lp01, l. plantarum lp02, l. pentosus lps01, and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01, and 2 bifidobacterium strains, b. breve br03 and b. breve b632. the inhibiting extent was slightly different among  these strains, with l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii ldd01 showing the highest activity on e. coli o157:h7. conclusions: most of the probiotics studied are able to antagonize the growth of the 5 strains of e. coli tested, including the o157:h7 biotype, well known for their characteristic to produce a wide variety of biogenic amines considered responsible for dangerous systemic intoxications.

AB  == background: gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very widespread condition. in europe, it is estimated that about 175 million people suffer from this disease and have to chronically take drugs to increase gastric ph. the proton pump inhibitors (ppis) such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are the most widely used drug typology in this regard. however, the inhibition of normal gastric acid secretion has important side effects, the most important being bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum with a concentration of >10(5) viable cells/ml. as a major consequence of this, many harmful or even pathogenic  bacteria contained in some foods could survive the gastric transit and colonize either the stomach itself, the duodenum, or the gut, where they could establish acute and even chronic infections with unavoidable consequences for the host's health. in other words, the "gastric barrier effect" is strongly reduced or even  disrupted. to date, there are no real strategies to deal with this widespread, although still relatively little known, problem. the aim of this study was to confirm the gastric bacterial overgrowth in long-term ppi consumers and to assess the efficacy of some probiotic bacteria, belonging to both genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, in the reduction of gastric and duodenal bacterial overgrowth, therefore partially restoring the gastric barrier effect against foodborne pathogenic bacteria. methods: for this purpose, probiotics with a strong demonstrated inhibitory activity on gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, were tested in a human intervention trial involving a total of  30 subjects treated with ppis for either 3 to 12 consecutive months (short-term)  or >12 consecutive months (long-term). an additional 10 subjects not taking ppis  were enrolled and used as a control group representing the general population. four selected probiotics probiotical spa (novara, italy), namely lactobacillus rhamnosus lr06 (dsm 21981), lactobacillus pentosus lps01 (dsm 21980), lactobacillus plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021), and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.  delbrueckii ldd01 (dsm 22106) were administered for 10 days to 10 subjects treated with ppis for >12 months (group b). in the 60 mg formulation, n-acetylcysteine was included as well in light of its well-known mechanical effects on bacterial biofilms. gastroscopies were performed at the beginning of the study (d0) in all the groups (a, b, c, and d) and after 10 days (d10) in group b only; that is, at the end of probiotics intake. the total viable cells and total lactobacillus were quantified in gastric juice and duodenal brushing material from all subjects. the results were compared among all the groups and with the control subjects (group d) to confirm the bacterial overgrowth. a comparison was made also between d0 and d10 in group b to quantify the efficacy of the 4 probiotics administered for 10 days. fecal samples were collected from all groups at d0, including subjects not treated with ppis, and in group b only at d10. specific bacterial classes, namely enterococci, total coliforms, e. coli, molds, and yeasts were quantified in all fecal specimens. results: the results collected confirmed the strong bacterial overgrowth in the stomach and duodenum of people treated with ppis compared with subjects with a normal intragastric acidity. it is also worth noting that the bacterial cell counts in subjects who underwent a long-term treatment with a ppi were greater than the results from subjects taking these drugs for 3 to 12 months. the intake of 4 specific probiotic strains with a marked antagonistic activity towards 5 e. coli bacteria, including the enterohaemorrhagic o157:h7 strain, and an effective amount of n-acetylcysteine (nac) was able to significantly reduce bacterial overgrowth in long-term ppi-treated subjects. total lactobacilli represented the major percentage of bacterial counts, thus demonstrating the ability of such bacteria to colonize the stomach and the duodenum, at least temporarily, and to consequently restore the gastric barrier effect. a significant decrease in fecal  enterococci, total coliforms, e. coli, molds, and yeasts in subjects treated with ppis was recorded at the end of probiotics supplementation (d10) compared with baseline (d0) in group b. this is a further confirmation of the barrier effect also exerted at the stomach level. conclusions: ppis are the most widely sold and used drugs in the world. however, the chronic use of these pharmacological molecules exposes the subject to the risk of foodborne infections as most pathogens are able to survive the gastric transit in a condition of significantly decreased acidity.

AB  == the 67 kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen (mcra) is a member of the mcra family of proteins present in a wide range of bacteria and was predicted to have fatty acid isomerase function. we have now characterised the catalytic activity of mcras from four lab stains, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lgg, l. plantarum st-iii, l. acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12. mcra genes  from these strains were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and the recombinant protein function was analysed with lipid profiles by gc-ms. the four  mcras catalysed the conversion of linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives, which suggests that mcra proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production. this is the first report of mcra from l. rhamnosus with such catalytic function.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus plantarum cjlp243 on the growth performance and cytokine  response of weaning pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of diets containing lactobacillus plantarum cjlp243 on the growth and cytokine response of weaning pigs (sus scrofa) challenged with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec). in a 28-d experiment (14 d before and 14 d after challenge), a total of 108 pigs at 20 +/- 1 d of age were allotted to 1 of 6 diets. these were a control diet without etec challenge (con) and 5 treatment diets with etec challenge, including a control diet with etec challenge (negative control, nc); a positive control diet  containing antibiotics (pc); control diet plus (10(8), 10(9), or 10(10)) cfu/kg l. plantarum cjlp243 (t1, t2, and t3, respectively). after challenge, nc showed the least adfi, whereas pc and t3 had the greatest adfi (p = 0.002). the adg of pc, t2, and t3 were greater (p = 0.001) than that of con, nc, and t1 during wk 1  to wk 2. during wk 3 to wk 4, a marked decline was seen in nc (p = 0.001) compared with con, whereas pc and t3 showed increased adg (p = 0.001). the overall adg of pc and t3 were greater (p < 0.001) than the remaining groups. the  pc and t3 had the greatest g:f during the second 2 wk (p = 0.002), and the overall 4-wk experimental period (p = 0.003). at 3 h after challenge, all groups  except con had greater rectal temperatures (rt; p < 0.05). the rt decreased to prechallenge temperatures at 9 h (pc and t3), 24 h (t1 and t2), and remained increased until d 7 in nc. at 7 and 14 d postinfection, the number of animals detected positive for etec by pcr assay was the greatest in nc; however, the pc group had the fewest etec-positive animals (p < 0.05), which was similar to t3. all challenged pigs, except t2, had greater concentrations of serum haptoglobin compared with con, with the greatest concentration observed in nc (p < 0.001). challenged pigs had increased serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) 3 to 48 h postinfection, with the greatest concentration of tnf-alpha at 48 h observed in nc (p < 0.05). similarly, greater (p < 0.05) serum concentrations of interferon-gamma were observed for 9 h (t1 and t3), 24 h (t2 and pc), and 48 h (nc) postinfection. the serum concentration of il-6 increased (p < 0.05) for 3 h in t3 and 24 h in nc. in conclusion, our findings suggest that l. plantarum cjlp243, at a concentration of 10(10) cfu/kg, may serve as a potential alternative to antibiotic supplementation to improve the growth and health performance of weaning pigs, especially during acute inflammation of the gut after bacterial infections.

TI  == stimulation of cadaverine production by foodborne pathogens in the presence of lactobacillus, lactococcus, and streptococcus spp.
AB  == the effect of lactobacillus plantarum (fi8595), lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg 1363), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (il 1403), and streptococcus  thermophilus on cadaverine and other biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens was investigated lysine decarboxylase broth. both of lactic acid bacteria and foodborne pathogens used (especially staphylococcus aureus, e. coli, lc. lactis subsp. lactis and lb. plantarum) had an ability to convert aminoacids  into biogenic amine. the conversion of lysine into cadaverine was the highest (167.11 mg/l) by lactobacillus spp. gram-positive bacteria generally had a greater ability to produce cadaverine with corresponding value of 46.26, 53.76, and 154.54 mg/l for enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, and listeria monocytogenes, respectively. significant variations on biogenic amine production were observed in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains (p < 0.05). the role of lactic acid bacteria on biogenic amine production by foodborne pathogens varied depending on strains and specific amine. cadaverine accumulation by enterobactericeae was increased in the presence of lactic acid bacteria strains except for st. thermophilus, which induced 2-fold lower cadaverine production by  s. paratyphi a. lc. lactis subsp. lactis and lc. lactis subsp. cremoris induced 10-fold higher increases in histamine for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, respectively. lactic acid bacteria resulted in strong increases in cadaverine production by p. aeruginosa, although remarkable decreases were observed for histamine, spermidine, dopamine, agmatine, and tma in the presence of lactic acid bacteria in lysine decarboxylase broth . the result of the study showed that amine positive lactic acid bacteria strains in fermented food led to significant  amine accumulation by contaminant bacteria and their accumulation in food product may be controlled by the use of proper starters with amine-negative activity.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of prebiotics by lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194: selectivity, viability and effect of metabolites on beta-glucuronidase activity.
AB  == prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (fos) escape metabolism in upper gi tract undergo microbial metabolism in colon and thereby influence the nature, type and  number of intestinal microbiota to improve host's health. the present study focuses on the ability of lactobacillus plantarum cfr 2194 to utilize fos as a selective carbon and energy source. the effect of fermentative metabolites of l.  plantarum on the beta-glucuronidase was also investigated. a total of 16 strains  of lactobacilli were assessed for their ability to ferment oligosaccharides. l. plantarum cfr 2194, an isolate from kanjika was found to utilize fos effectively. lactic acid was the main metabolic end product, followed by acetic acid, butyric  acid, formic acid and ethanol. the inhibitory effects of these metabolites have been confirmed through the reduction of beta-glucuronidase activity. l. plantarum when co-cultured with beta-glucuronidase producing e. coli, in a basal media containing fos as an energy source, could inhibit the growth of the pathogen during the course of fermentation. the results showed that l. plantarum cfr 2194  has the ability to utilize the prebiotic fos as a selective carbon and energy source. the organism could inhibit the growth of the pathogen which produces beta-glucuronidase and lowered its activity by the metabolites of fos which indicates the probable use of l. plantarum through dietary intervention in combating colon carcinogenesis.

TI  == basic characterization and partial purification of beta-glucosidase from cell-free extracts of oenococcus oeni st81.
AB  == aims: this study was designed to characterize a beta-glucosidase of oenococcus oeni st81, a strain isolated from a spanish wine of the origin appellation ribeira sacra. methods and results: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 seems to have a periplasmic localization into the cells. this activity was strongly inhibited by gluconic acid, partially inhibited by glucose and not inhibited by fructose, lactate, malate, mannitol or sorbitol. ethanol increased the activity of this enzyme up to 147%. among the several metal ions assayed, only fe(2)(+) (10 mmol l(-)(1)) and cu(2)(+) (5 mmol l(-)(1)) exhibited a partial inhibitory effect (40%). this enzyme was partially purified using a combination of ammonium  sulfate precipitation and chromatographic methods. the single peak because of beta-glucosidase in all chromatographic columns indicates the presence of a single enzyme with an estimated molecular mass of 140 kda. the calculated k(m) and v(max) values for 4-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside were 0.38 mmol l(-)(1) and 5.21 nmol min(-)(1), respectively. the enzyme was stable at ph 5.0 with a value of t(1/2) = 50 days for the crude extract. conclusions: the beta-glucosidase of o. oeni st81 is substantially different from those characterized from other wine-related lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus brevis; however, it appears to be closely related to a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni atcc baa-1163 cloned into escherichia coli. the periplasmic localization of the enzyme together with its high tolerance to ethanol and fructose, the low inhibitory effect of some wine-related compounds on the enzymatic activity and long-term stability of the enzyme could be of interest for winemaking. significance and impact of the study: information regarding a beta-glucosidase from o. oeni st81 is presented. although the release of aroma compounds by lab has been demonstrated, little information exists concerning the responsible enzymes. to our knowledge, this study contains  the first characterization of a native beta-glucosidase purified from crude extracts of o. oeni st81.

TI  == isolation and identification of new lactobacilli from goatling stomach and investigation of reuterin production in lactobacillus reuteri strains.
AB  == five new strains of lactobacilli isolated from goatling's stomach were identified by molecular-biological approaches. profiles of fermentable saccharides, gram staining, and cell morphology were also determined. they were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (strains ko4b, ko4m, ko5) and as lactobacillus plantarum (strains kg1z, kg4). in dna samples of all newly isolated l. reuteri strains as well as in l. reuteri e (lreu e; originated from lamb), the part of gldc gene, coding large subunit of glycerol dehydratase, that is necessary for 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-hpa; reuterin) production, was amplified using two designed primer sets. however, the 3-hpa production was revealed only in the strain lreu e. it produced five- or ten-fold lower amount of 3-hpa in comparison  with probiotic l. reuteri atcc 55730 in aerobic or anaerobic conditions, respectively. moreover, lreu e completely lost its production ability after ca. five passages in mrs medium. the co-incubation of lreu e, but not other l. reuteri isolates, with escherichia coli re-induced 3-hpa production. in the case  of l. reuteri atcc 55730, the 3-hpa production increased more than four times after co-incubation with e. coli.

TI  == bile stimulates cell surface hydrophobicity, congo red binding and biofilm formation of lactobacillus strains.
AB  == seventeen lactobacillus strains were tested for cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) using the salt aggregation test (sat) and congo red binding (crb) assay. crb was  dependent on ph and ionic strength and was protease-sensitive. in the presence of 100 mug ml(-1) cholesterol, the crb was significantly reduced. autoaggregating (aa) lactobacillus crispatus strains showed 50% more crb than the reference strain, the curli-producing escherichia coli mc4 100. crb of l. crispatus 12005,  l. paracasei f8, l. plantarum f44 and l. paracasei f19 were enhanced when grown in man rogosa sharpe (mrs) broth with 0.5% taurocholic acid (ta) or 5% porcine bile (pb) (p < 0.05). csh was also enhanced for the non-aa strains l. plantarum f44, l. paracasei f19 and l. rhamnosus gg when grown in mrs broth with 0.5% ta, 5% pb or 0.25% mucin, with enhanced biofilm formation in mrs broth with bile (p < 0.05). two aa strains, l. crispatus 12005 and l. paracasei f8, developed biofilm  independent of bile or mucin. in summary, under bile-stressed growth conditions,  early (24-h cultures) biofilm formation is associated with an increase in hydrophobic cell surface proteins and high crb. late mature (72-h culture) biofilm contained more carbohydrates, as shown by crystal violet staining.

TI  == inhibitory potential of lactobacilli against escherichia coli internalization by  ht 29 cells.
AB  == a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization method was employed to evaluate  the competitive inhibitory effect of three lactobacillus strains (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus plantarum) against escherichia  coli internalization in a model system of ht 29 cells. furthermore, aggregation and adhesion abilities of the lactobacillus strains were examined. all lactobacilli were able to attach to the ht 29 cells and aggregate with pathogens; however, the adhesion and aggregation degree was strain-dependent. l. reuteri possessed a high capacity of adhesion (6.80 +/- 0.63; log cfu +/- sem per well),  whereas lower capacities were expressed by l. gasseri (4.52 +/- 0.55) and l. plantarum (4.90 +/- 0.98). additionally, l. reuteri showed the rapid or normal ability to aggregate with selected e. coli in comparison with remaining two lactobacilli, which showed only slow or negative aggregative reaction. internalization of e. coli into the cell lines was markedly suppressed by l. reuteri, while l. gasseri and l. plantarum caused only a minimum anti-invasion effect. the fact that l. reuteri in our experiments showed an outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with the rest  strains, suggested that one of the possible mechanisms of preventing pathogen adhesion and invasion is simple competitions at certain receptors and capability  to block receptor binding sites, or that an avid interaction between l. reuteri and the host cell might be modulating intracellular events responsible for the e. coli internalization. moreover, l. reuteri exhibited a strong ability to aggregate with e. coli, which could be another limiting factor of pathogen invasion.

TI  == functional properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from dairy products.
AB  == twenty-four acid- and bile-tolerant lactobacilli isolates from dairy products were identified and further in vitro characterized for the presence of functional traits potentially useful for probiotic applications, which included desirable and undesirable traits, such as biofilm formation, ability to inhibit intestinal  pathogens, antibiotic susceptibility, and enzyme activity. the majority of examined strains were susceptible to certain antimicrobial agents (streptomycin,  gentamicin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin-dalfopristin),  except for three strains of lactobacillus rhamnosus with minimal inhibitory concentration levels for streptomycin higher than the microbiological breakpoints (>/=32 mug/ml), which are considered as resistant. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase, and moderate and high beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in nine strains, which were eliminated from further examination together with three isolates showing unsuitable antibiotic resistance. of the remaining 12 isolates, 4 (lactobacillus fermentum 202, lactobacillus gallinarum 7001, l. rhamnosus 183, and lactobacillus plantarum l2-1) manifested an outstanding potential to inhibit selected intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including escherichia coli and salmonella spp., and simultaneously demonstrated strong biofilm-forming capacity. in conclusion, the results of our in vitro experiments showed that the above four strains had a potential probiotic value and met the criteria to be identified as a possible probiotic microorganism, with the necessity of verification through well-designed in vivo experimental, clinical, and technological studies before the strains can be used  as probiotics or as starter probiotic cultures.

TI  == all 4 bile salt hydrolase proteins are responsible for the hydrolysis activity in lactobacillus plantarum st-iii.
AB  == in vertebrates, bile salt hydrolysis plays an essential role in fat metabolism. bile salts are synthesized in the liver. and in the small intestine glycine and taurine are de-conjugated from bile salts by the enzyme bile salt hydrolase (bsh) from intestinal microbes. however, the mechanism of bile salt hydrolysis in lactobacillus plantarum is still ambiguous. four predicted bile salt hydrolase (bsh) genes from l. plantarum st-iii were cloned into escherichia coli. the function of these genes was explored by overexpression. all 4 proteins that were  studied showed activity against glycine- or taurine-conjugated bile salts. substrate preference was also observed in bsh proteins, especially for the enzyme bsh1, which had high hydrolysis activity for glycodeoxycholic acid. these results suggest that all 4 bile salt hydrolases may be responsible for the bile salt hydrolysis activity in l. plantarum st-iii. practical application: hypercholesterolemia is considered one of the major risk factors for coronary heart disease. more interest has focused on intestinal microbes because of their  role in the decrease of serum cholesterol. bsh proteins play an important role in the reduction of cholesterol. this paper adds to a better understanding of bsh proteins of intestinal microbes. it gives a great hint that probiotics can be used to solve hypercholesterolemia one day.

AB  == recent trials have questioned the safety of untargeted oral iron supplementation  in developing regions. excess of luminal iron could select for enteric pathogens  at the expense of beneficial commensals in the human gut microflora, thereby increasing the incidence of infectious diseases. the objective of the current study was to determine the effect of high iron availability on virulence traits of prevalent enteric pathogens at the host-microbe interface. a panel of enteric  bacteria was cultured under iron-limiting conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ferric citrate to assess the effect on bacterial growth, epithelial adhesion, invasion, translocation and epithelial damage in vitro. translocation and epithelial integrity experiments were performed using a  transwell system in which caco-2 cells were allowed to differentiate to a tight epithelial monolayer mimicking the intestinal epithelial barrier. growth of salmonella typhimurium and other enteric pathogens was increased in response to iron. adhesion of s. typhimurium to epithelial cells markedly increased when these bacteria were pre-incubated with increasing iron concentration (p = 0.0001), whereas this was not the case for the non-pathogenic lactobacillus plantarum (p = 0.42). cellular invasion and epithelial translocation of s. typhimurium followed the trend of increased adhesion. epithelial damage was increased upon incubation with s. typhimurium or citrobacter freundii that were pre-incubated under iron-rich conditions. in conclusion, our data fit with the consensus that oral iron supplementation is not without risk as iron could, in addition to inducing pathogenic overgrowth, also increase the virulence of prevalent enteric pathogens.

TI  == production of two bacteriocins in various growth conditions produced by gram-positive bacteria isolated from chicken cecum.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum clp29 and enterococcus faecium cle34 isolated from the cecal contents of young broiler chicks were identified based on physiological and biochemical characteristics, and identification was confirmed by 16s rrna sequencing. both bacteria showed a broad range of inhibitory action against bacteria such as salmonella and escherichia coli and produced two peptides, plantaricin clp29 and enterocin cle34. treatment with proteinase k, trypase, or benase resulted in the loss of activity of the two peptides, confirming their proteinaceous nature. the highest activity levels for both bacteria were recorded in de man - rogosa - sharpe agar at ph 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0, at 37 degrees c. carbon and nitrogen sources affected the antibacterial activities of the two bacteriocins in different combinations, which suggested that the antibacterial abilities of different bacteriocins produced in nutrient sources were various.

TI  == probiotic features of two oral lactobacillus isolates.
AB  == in this study, we checked lactobacilli strains of human origin for their potential as probiotic. samples were collected from oral mucosa of 16 healthy individuals, out of which twenty isolates were obtained and two of them were selected and identified as lactobacillus plantarum (g1) and l. casei (g3). both isolates exhibited antagonistic action towards pathogenic microorganisms such as  staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella abony, and clostridium sporogenes, but not on the growth of candida albicans. the bacteriocin activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 6358-p was shown only by  l. plantarum g1. moreover, the isolates g1 and g3 showed good viability in the acid gastric environment and in the gut environment containing bovine bile salts. the viability of g1 and g3 isolates in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adhesion to the intestinal mucosa were also confirmed in vivo. the biochemical tests of blood samples revealed lower levels of serum triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as reduced activity of alkaline phosphatase in all lactobacilli-treated wistar rats, compared to control ones. no toxicity for nmri  ham mice was observed. according to our experimental results, these findings imply that l. plantarum g1 and l. casei g3 could be characterized as potential probiotics.

TI  == structure of plantaricin locus of lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum 8p-a3 is a strain which is well known on the russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. the strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. l. plantarum 8p-a3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. dna sequence analysis of l. plantarum 8p-a3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins ef and  nc8. the plantaricin locus found in l. plantarum 8p-a3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in l. plantarum j51.

TI  == construction of theta-type shuttle vector for leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pcb42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == preliminary x-ray analysis of twinned crystals of the q88y25_lacpl esterase from  lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1.
AB  == q88y25_lacpl is an esterase produced by the lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 that shows amino-acid sequence similarity to carboxylesterases from the hormone-sensitive lipase family, in particular the afest esterase from the archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus and the hyperthermophilic esterase estei isolated from a metagenomic library. n-terminally his(6)-tagged q88y25_lacpl has  been overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21 (de3) cells, purified and crystallized at 291 k using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. mass spectrometry was used to determine the purity and homogeneity of the enzyme. crystals of his(6)-tagged q88y25_lacpl were prepared in a solution containing 2.8 m sodium acetate trihydrate ph 7.0. x-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.24 a resolution on beamline id29 at the esrf. the apparent crystal point group was 422; however, initial global analysis of the intensity statistics (data processed with high symmetry in space group i422) and subsequent tests on data processed with low symmetry (space group i4) showed that the crystals were almost perfectly merohedrally twinned. most probably, the true space group is i4, with unit-cell parameters a = 169.05, b = 169.05, c = 183.62 a.

TI  == novel multi-component enzyme machinery in lactic acid bacteria catalyzing c=c double bond migration useful for conjugated fatty acid synthesis.
AB  == linoleic acid isomerase was identified as a multi-component enzyme system that consists of three enzymes that exist in both the membrane and soluble fractions of lactobacillus plantarum. one enzyme (cla-hy) is present in the membrane fraction, while two enzymes (cla-dh and cla-dc) exist in the soluble fraction. three escherichia coli transformants expressing cla-hy, cla-dh, and cla-dc were constructed. conjugated linoleic acid (cla) and 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid were generated from linoleic acid only when all these three e. coli transformants were used as catalysts simultaneously. cla-hy catalyzed the hydration reaction, a part of linoleic acid isomerization, to produce 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid.  this multi-component enzyme system required oxidoreduction cofactors such as nadh and fad. this is the first report to reveal enzymes genes and the elaborate machinery that synthesizes cla, especially an important isomer of cis-9, trans-11-cla, in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == functionalized arrays of raman-enhancing nanoparticles for capture and culture-free analysis of bacteria in human blood.
AB  == detecting bacteria in clinical samples without using time-consuming culture processes would allow rapid diagnoses. such a culture-free detection method requires the capture and analysis of bacteria from a body fluid, which are usually of complicated composition. here we show that coating ag-nanoparticle arrays with vancomycin (van) can provide label-free analysis of bacteria via surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (sers), leading to a ~1,000-fold increase in  bacteria capture, without introducing significant spectral interference. bacteria from human blood can be concentrated onto a microscopic van-coated area while blood cells are excluded. furthermore, a van-coated substrate provides distinctly different sers spectra of van-susceptible and van-resistant enterococcus, indicating its potential use for drug-resistance tests. our results represent a critical step towards the creation of sers-based multifunctional biochips for rapid culture- and label-free detection and drug-resistant testing of microorganisms in clinical samples.

TI  == antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  == fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (staphylococcus aureus ep167, acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1, escherichia coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) and candida albicans my1055) and two probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum lch17 and lactobacillus brevis lch23). a total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. a total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus ep167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rrna sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders pleosporales, hypocreales and xylariales dominated. differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed  among isolates from the same species. some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.

TI  == physicochemical, microbiological and sensory profiles of fermented milk containing probiotic strains isolated from kefir.
AB  == a two-strain starter culture containing lactobacillus plantarum cidca 83114, a potential probiotic strain isolated from kefir grains, and streptococcus thermophilus cidca 321 was tested for the preparation of a fermented milk product. kluyveromyces marxianus cidca 8154, a yeast with immunomodulatory properties was included to formulate a three-strain starter culture. supernatants of enterohaemorragic escherichia coli, shiga-toxin-producing strain, along with a two-strain or a three-strain starter culture were included in the medium of vero-cell surface cultures. the results demonstrated that these combinations of microorganisms antagonize the cytopathic action of shiga toxins. the cell concentration of lb. plantarum did not decrease during fermentation, indicating that the viability of this strain was not affected by low ph, nor did the number  of viable bacteria change during 21 days of storage in either fermented products. the number of viable yeasts increases during fermentation and storage. trained assessors analyzed the general acceptability of fresh fermented milks and considered both acceptable. the milk fermented with the two-strain starter culture was considered acceptable after two week of storage, while the product fermented with the three-strain starter culture remained acceptable for less than one week. the main changes in sensory attributes detected by the trained panel were in sour taste, milky taste and also in fermented attributes. the correlation between different sensory attributes and acceptability indicated that the panel was positively influenced by milky attributes (taste, odour, and flavour) as well as the intensity of flavour. in conclusion, the two-strain starter culture would  be the more promising alternative for inclusion of that potential probiotic lactobacillus in a fermented milk product.

TI  == novel surface display system for heterogonous proteins on lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == aims: to establish a novel cell surface display system that would enable the display of target proteins on lactobacillus plantarum. methods and results: blastp analysis of the amino acids sequence data revealed that the n-terminus of  the putative muropeptidase muro from l. plantarum contained two putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that the muro was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of muro for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to muro at its c-terminus and the resulting fusion protein was expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with l. plantarum cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces  of l. plantarum cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. plantarum cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested  that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for muro. sds sensitivity assay showed that the gfp fluorescence intensity was reduced after being treated with sds. to demonstrate the applicability of the muro-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase from bifidobacterium bifidium, in place of gfp, was functionally displayed on the surface of l. plantarum cells via muro. conclusions: the muro was a novel anchor protein for constructing a surface display system for l. plantarum. significance and impact of study: the success in surface display of gfp and beta-galactosidase opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of muro for surface display in l. plantarum.

TI  == a practical guide to genome-scale metabolic models and their analysis.
AB  == genome-scale metabolic reconstructions and their analysis with constraint-based modeling techniques have gained enormous momentum. it is a natural next step after sequencing of a genome, as a technique that links top-down systems biology  analyses at genome scale with bottom-up systems biology modeling scrutiny. this chapter aims at (systems) biologists that have an interest in, but no extensive knowledge of, applying genome-scale metabolic reconstruction and modeling to their organism. rather than being comprehensive--excellent and extensive reviews  exist on every aspect of this field--we give a rather personal account on our experience with the process of reconstruction and modeling. first, we place genome-scale metabolic models in the spectrum of modeling approaches, and rather  extensively discuss, for nonexperts, the central concept in constraint-based modeling: the solution space that is bounded through constraints on fluxes. we subsequently provide an overview of the different steps involved in metabolic reconstruction and modeling, pointing to aspects that we found difficult, important, not well enough addressed in the current reviews, or any combination thereof. in this way, we hope that this chapter serves as a practical guide through the field.

AB  == a novel sanitizer composed of lactic acid and peroxyacetic acid (la-paa) was developed as an alternative to chlorinated water (cw) for fresh produce processing. single strains of lactobacillus plantarum, nonpathogenic escherichia  coli k-12, and listeria innocua were used to demonstrate the microbial efficacy of la-paa. la-paa achieved a >7.8-log reduction of l. innocua and l. plantarum suspended in water at 4 degrees c for 20 s, and la, paa, and cw achieved reductions of 0.4, 4.8, and 2.7 log, respectively. la-paa, when compared with la, paa, and cw, enhanced the reduction of l. innocua attached to romaine leaves by >2.2 log, and improved the removal of e. coli attached to spinach leaves by >2.4  log. the exponential improvement in the microbial efficacy of la-paa showed synergism between la and paa. la-paa microbial efficacy was inversely proportional to ph value and directly correlated with residence time and concentration. despite an improvement in microbial reduction through the addition of surfactant to la-paa, the usage of surfactant in washing fresh produce was impeded by excessive foaming during actual processing. effects of organic matter  on the performance of la-paa were minimal. external sensory evaluations showed that la-paa had no negative effects on the quality of lettuce and tender leaves.  temperature-abuse studies demonstrated that la-paa reduced decay by approximately 50% when compared with cw. overall, these results support the premise that la-paa has significant potential to be an alternative to cw for fresh produce processing.

TI  == structure-function relationships of the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids  and their metabolism by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine structure-function relationships of antibacterial phenolic acids and their metabolites produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab). methods and results: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 6 hydroxybenzoic and 6 hydroxycinnamic acids were determined with lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hammesii, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis as indicator strains. the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids increased at lower ph. a decreasing number of hydroxyl groups enhanced the activity of hydroxybenzoic acids, but had  minor effects on hydroxycinnamic acids. substitution of hydroxyl groups with methoxy groups increased the activity of hydroxybenzoic, but not of hydroxycinnamic, acid. metabolism of chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, protocatechuic or p-hydroxybenzoic acids by l. plantarum, l. hammesii, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri was analysed by lc-dad-ms. furthermore, mics of substrates and metabolites were compared. decarboxylated and/or reduced metabolites of phenolic acids had a lower activity than the substrates. strain-specific metabolism of phenolic acids generally corresponded to resistance. conclusions: the influence of lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of hydroxybenzoic acids is stronger than that of hydroxycinnamic acids.  metabolism of phenolic acids by lab detoxifies phenolic acids. significance and impact of the study: results allow the targeted selection of plant extracts for food preservation, and selection of starter cultures for fermented products.

TI  == effects of two lactobacillus strains on lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.
AB  == background: the hypocholesterolemic effects of lactic acid bacteria (lab) have now become an area of great interest and controversy for many scientists. in this study, we evaluated the effects of lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a and lactobacillus fermentum m1-16 on body weight, lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora of rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. methods: forty rats were assigned to four groups and fed either a normal or a high-cholesterol diet. the lab-treated groups received the high-cholesterol diet supplemented with lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a or lactobacillus fermentum m1-16. the rats were sacrificed after a 6-week feeding period. body weights, visceral organ and fat pad weights, serum and liver cholesterol and lipid levels, and fecal cholesterol  and bile acid concentrations were measured. liver lipid deposition and adipocyte  size were evaluated histologically. results: compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet but without lab supplementation, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides levels were significantly decreased in lab-treated rats (p < 0.05), with no significant change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels and liver lipid deposition were significantly decreased in the lab-treated groups (p < 0.05). accordingly, both fecal cholesterol and bile acids levels were significantly increased after lab administration (p < 0.05). intestinal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium colonies were increased while escherichia coli  colonies were decreased in the lab-treated groups. fecal water content was higher in the lab-treated groups. compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet, administration of lactobacillus plantarum 9-41-a resulted in decreases in the body weight gain, liver and fat pad weight, and adipocytes size (p < 0.05). conclusions: this study suggests that lab supplementation has hypocholesterolemic effects in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet. the ability to lower serum cholesterol varies among lab strains. our strains might be able to improve the intestinal microbial balance and potentially improve intestinal transit time. although the mechanism is largely unknown, l. plantarum 9-41-a may play a role in fat metabolism.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cucumber fermentation brines.
AB  == bacterial pathogens have been reported on fresh cucumbers and other vegetables used for commercial fermentation. the food and drug administration currently has  a 5-log reduction standard for e. coli o157:h7 and other vegetative pathogens in  acidified pickle products. for fermented vegetables, which are acid foods, there  is little data documenting the conditions needed to kill acid resistant pathogens. to address this knowledge gap, we obtained 10 different cucumber fermentation brines at different stages of fermentation from 5 domestic commercial plants. cucumber brines were used to represent vegetable fermentations because cabbage and other vegetables may have inhibitory compounds that may affect survival. the 5-log reduction times for e. coli o157:h7 strains in the commercial brines were found to be positively correlated with brine ph, and ranged from 3 to 24 d for ph values of 3.2 to 4.6, respectively. in a laboratory  cucumber juice medium that had been previously fermented with lactobacillus plantarum or leuconostoc mesenteroides (ph 3.9), a 5-log reduction was achieved within 1 to 16 d depending on ph, acid concentration, and temperature. during competitive growth at 30 degrees c in the presence of l. plantarum or l. mesenteroides in cucumber juice, e. coli o157:h7 cell numbers were reduced to below the level of detection within 2 to 3 d. these data may be used to aid manufacturers of fermented vegetable products determine safe production practices based on fermentation ph and temperature. practical application: disease causing  strains of the bacterium e. coli may be present on fresh vegetables. our investigation determined the time needed to kill e. coli in cucumber fermentation brines and how e. coli strains are killed in competition with naturally present lactic acid bacteria. our results showed how brine ph and other brine conditions  affected the killing of e. coli strains. these data can be used by producers of fermented vegetable products to help assure consumer safety.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by kimchi prepared with bacteriocin-producing starter culture.
AB  == kimchi (starter kimchi) was prepared with leuconostoc citreum gj7, a bacteriocin  producer, with the objective of preventing growth and/or survival of foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhi, and staphylococcus  aureus. numbers of the pathogens inoculated to 5.41 to 5.63 log cfu/ml into the filtrate of freshly made starter kimchi remained stable for the first 12 h of incubation at 10 degrees c. reductions of 2.69, 2.88, and 3.42 log cfu/ml were observed 48 h after inoculation with e. coli o157:h7, s. typhi, and s. aureus, respectively. use of the bacteriocin-producing starter culture for kimchi fermentation significantly reduced the numbers of pathogens in the filtrate. reductions of 3.85, 4.45, and 5.19 log cfu/ml were observed 48 h after inoculation for e. coli o157:h7, s. typhi, and s. aureus, respectively. presumably, the antimicrobial activity came from the ingredients of kimchi such as sulfur-containing compounds, low ph (approximately ph 4.5) produced by the conversion of sugars into organic acids and the bacteriocins potentially produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab), such as kimchicin gj7. together, these data suggest that addition of a starter culture capable of producing bacteriocins could serve as a strategy to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption and that the kimchi filtrate itself may be used as a food preservative. practical application: the adaptation of the starter fermentation into kimchi induced a faster die off of the pathogens as compared to natural fermentation. the in situ bateriocin-production by leuc. citreum gj7 in kimchi would act with antimicrobial kimchi ingredients in a synergistic manner to protect the fermented product from delivering pathogens upon consumption.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria (19 isolates) from bella di cerignola italian table olives were investigated for their technological and probiotic properties for the selection of multifunctional starter cultures for table olives. the bacteria were first identified by phenotyping and genotyping, then characterized for the production of biogenic amines, growth at different ph, nacl concentrations, and temperatures. the potentiality of the bacteria to have some probiotic properties  (antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, survival in low ph and in the presence of bile salts, ability to adhere to the mammalian cells model ipec-j2) was also investigated. eighteen of the studied isolates were identified  as lactobacillus plantarum and one as enterococcus faecalis. all bacteria were able to grow at a range of ph between 4.0 and 10.0 as well as in media supplemented with 2.5 to 7.5% of nacl and 0.3% bile salts and survived in mrs broth acidified at ph 2.5; moreover, they inhibited significantly escherichia coli o157:h7. the adhesion to ipec-j2 cells was in general low to moderate (5.3 to 8.3%); however, 2 isolates of l. plantarum (c16 and c19) showed interesting higher adhesion values (up to 16%). our results suggest that at least 3 isolates  could be possible multifunctional starters for bella di cerignola olives: l. plantarum 16 and 19 for mainly their probiotic properties and l. plantarum 10 for mainly its technological characteristics. practical application: a functional starter is a microorganism exerting benefits on human health (probiotic) and able to guide a fermentation (starter). the main goal of this article was to select a  functional starter for table olives.

TI  == effects on weight gain and gut microbiota in rats given bacterial supplements and a high-energy-dense diet from fetal life through to 6 months of age.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the long-term effects of a high-energy-dense diet, supplemented with lactobacillus plantarum (lp) or escherichia coli (ec), on weight gain, fattening and the gut microbiota in rats.  since the mother's dietary habits can influence offspring physiology, dietary regimens started with the dams at pregnancy and throughout lactation and continued with the offspring for 6 months. the weight gain of group lp was lower  than that of groups c (control) and ec (p = 0.086). more retroperitoneal adipose  tissue (p = 0.030) and higher plasma leptin (p = 0.035) were observed in group ec compared with group lp. the viable count of enterobacteriaceae was higher in group ec than in group lp (p = 0.019), and when all animals were compared, enterobacteriaceae correlated positively with body weight (r 0.428, p = 0.029). bacterial diversity was lower in group ec than in groups c (p </= 0.05) and lp (p </= 0.05). firmicutes, bacteroidetes and verrucomicrobia dominated in all groups, but bacteroidetes were more prevalent in group c than in groups lp (p = 0.036) and ec (p = 0.056). the same five bacterial families dominated the microbiota of  groups ec and c, and four of these were also present in group lp. the other five  families dominating in group lp were not found in any of the other groups. multivariate data analysis pointed in the same directions as the univariate statistics. the present results suggest that supplementation of l. plantarum or e. coli can have long-term effects on the composition of the intestinal microbiota, as well as on weight gain and fattening.

TI  == partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  == the probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33, isolated from traditional turkish tulum cheese were assessed. these two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg ml(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg ml(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at ph 2. they were also adhered to caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to escherichia coli lmg3083 (etec) and salmonella typhimurium sl1344. the strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature,  and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. the bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. tricine-sds-page of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kda and 2.7 kda for lb. brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33 bacteriocins, respectively.

AB  == probiotics and prebiotics, which can change the colonic microenvironment, are the areas of current interest. unutilizable fractions of the foods and fortificants,  which reach the colon can affect the profile of probiotics. effects of eight such factors viz. zinc sulphate, zinc carbonate, ferrous sulphate, ferric citrate, quercetin, gallic acid, phytic acid, and oxalic acid were, therefore, investigated on 24 h growth of lactobacillus acidophilus (l1) and lactobacillus plantarum (l2), two isolates of bifidobacteria (longum (l3) and bifidum (l4)) and a marketed consortium (l5) of eight probiotic cultures. mrs medium with marketed  fructooligosaccharide as the only source of carbon was used for study of dose response curves. quercetin and zinc sulphate showed significant positive effect for l1 and l5 (p < 0.01), whereas there was slight positive effect or no effect on growth of other probiotics. phytic acid showed a significant inhibitory effect for l2 and a slight inhibitory effect on l3 and l4 whereas l5 were able to tolerate phytic acid. oxalic acid had slight positive effect for l1 (p < 0.05) and l5 and no effect on growth of other probiotics (p > 0.05). further, zinc sulphate, ferrous sulphate, quercetin, and oxalic acid significantly inhibited growth of e. coli (p < 0.05)

TI  == expression of the lactobacillus plantarum surface layer mimp protein protected ncm460 epithelial cells from enteroinvasive escherichia coli infection.
AB  == our previous studies demonstrated that the micro integral membrane protein (mimp) located within the integral membrane protein of lactobacillus plantarum cgmcc 1258 protected the intestinal barrier from injury. to further analyze the protective effects conferred to intestinal epithelial cells by mimp, we established transient mimp-expressing ncm460 cells (ncm460/mimp) as a means of assessing their susceptibility to infection. we constructed a recombinant eukaryotic expression vector using pcdna3.1(-) and the mimp gene. the recombinant vector was then transduced into ncm460 cells and the anti-infective properties of the transient mimp-expressing ncm460/mimp cells assessed. flow cytometric analysis revealed that 82.16% +/-12.22% of ncm460/mimp cells expressed mimp and western blot analysis confirmed high levels of mimp expression. attachment assays showed that the ability of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) to attach to  ncm460/mimp cells decreased significantly compared to adhesion observed to ncm460 cells. western blot and quantitative rt-pcr showed that the expression levels of  tight junction (tj) proteins, including claudin-1, occludin, jam-1 and zo-1 in ncm460/mimp cells infected with epec were similar to levels observed in uninfected ncm460 cells. fluorescence further showed that ncm460/mimp cells had significantly higher tj protein staining intensity ocompared to ncm460 cells and  transmission electron microscopy indicated that tj structure was unchanged in ncm460/mimp cells infected with epec compared to ncm460 cells after epec infection. expression levels of pkc-eta and phosphorylated occludin were also higher after epec infection in ncm460/mimp cells compared to expression levels in epec-infected ncm460 cells. these data demonstrated that ncm460/mimp cells possessed epec anti-infective properties related to the activation of protein kinase c-eta and occludin phosphorylation.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == fluorescence and atomic force microscopy imaging of wall teichoic acids in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == although teichoic acids are major constituents of bacterial cell walls, little is known about the relationships between their spatial localization and their functional roles. here, we used single-molecule atomic force microscopy (afm) combined with fluorescence microscopy to image the distribution of wall teichoic  acids (wtas) in lactobacillus plantarum, in relation with their physiological roles. phenotype analysis of the wild-type strain and of mutant strains deficient for the synthesis of wtas (deltatago) or cell wall polysaccharides (deltacps1-4)  revealed that wtas are required for proper cell elongation and cell division. nanoscale imaging by afm showed that strains expressing wtas have a highly polarized surface morphology, the poles being much smoother than the side walls.  afm and fluorescence imaging with specific lectin probes demonstrated that the polarized surface structure correlates with a heterogeneous distribution of wtas, the latter being absent from the surface of the poles. these observations indicate that the polarized distribution of wtas in l. plantarum plays a key role in controlling cell morphogenesis (surface roughness, cell shape, elongation, and division).

TI  == protective effects of lactobacillus plantarum against epithelial barrier dysfunction of human colon cell line ncm460.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effects of lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) in the  intestinal permeability and expression of tight junction (tj) using the normal human colon cell line ncm460. methods: paracellular permeability of ncm460 monolayers was determined by transepithelial electrical resistance and dextran permeability. expression of tj proteins in ncm460 cell monolayers was detected by western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: l. plantarum played an important role in increasing transepithelial electrical resistance and decreasing the permeability to macromolecules of ncm460 monolayers against the disruption caused by enteropathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) or enteroinvasive e. coli. l. plantarum also prevented the decrease in the expression of tj proteins and f-actin in ncm460 cells. conclusion: l. plantarum can protect against dysfunction of ncm460 intestinal epithelial barrier caused by enteropathogenic e. coli or enteroinvasive e. coli, and thus can be a potential candidate of therapeutic agents for the treatment of intestinal diseases.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes in milk.
AB  == the current work studied four types of binary antagonist/pathogen bacterial culture system, in order to determine the effect of interaction between two strains of lactobacillus plantarum and two food-borne pathogens, listeria monocytogenes and escherichia coli, in whole uht milk at 37 degrees c. to determine the type of interaction between the two bacterial populations in co-cultures and to evaluate the antagonistic activity of the lactic acid bacteria (lab) on the pathogenic bacteria, the growth curves, the kinetic parameters, and  the ph profiles of mono- and co-cultures were compared. the lb. plantarum strains showed different bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis) production, auto- and co-inducible. the antibacterial effect of neutralized supernatants of mono and co-cultures harvested at different times of incubation was assessed in order  to establish the presence of bacteriocin-like inhibitory-substances (blis) and their possible relation to the growth inhibition of the pathogen. the lab reduced the growth of esch. coli and of list. monocytogenes by 4 and approximately 5 log  cycles, respectively and influenced other growth kinetic parameters, such as mu(max) and lag phase, in the different binary combinations. the growth of the lab was not relevantly altered by simultaneous growth with the pathogenic strains showing an interaction of amensalism. the pattern of inhibition exerted by the lab on the pathogens was different; lb. plantarum lb279 inhibited the growth of list. monocytogenes more effectively than that of esch. coli. the behaviour of esch. coli in co-culture with lb. plantarum ws4174 suggested the presence of metabolic crowding in the mechanism of growth suppression. this exploratory study showed the complexity and specific particularities of the inhibition phenomena between bacterial communities.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum surface layer adhesive protein protects intestinal epithelial cells against tight junction injury induced by enteropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum (lp) has previously been used for the treatment and prevention of intestinal disorders and disease. however, the role of the lp surface layer adhesive protein (slap) in inhibition of epithelial cell disruption is not fully understood. the aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effects of purified slap on caco-2 cells infected with enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec). the role of erk in lp-mediated inhibition of tight junction (tj) injury was also evaluated in order to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of lp in epithelial cells. slap was extracted and purified from lp cells using a porcine stomach mucin-sepharose 4b column. slap-mediated inhibition of bacterial adhesion was measured using a competition-based adhesion assay. expression of tj-associated proteins, maintenance of tj structure, and levels of extracellular signal regulated kinase (erk) and erk phosphorylation were assessed in slap-treated cells by a combination of real-time pcr, western blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. cell permeability was analyzed by measurement of trans-epithelial electrical resistance (ter) and dextran permeability. the effect of slap on levels of apoptosis in epithelial cells was assessed by flow cytometry. results from these experiments revealed that treatment with slap decreased the level of adhesion of epec to caco-2 cells. slap treatment also enhanced expression of tj proteins at both the mrna and protein levels and affected f-actin distribution. although erk levels remained unchanged, erk phosphorylation was increased by slap treatment. caco-2 cells treated with slap exhibited increased ter and decreased macromolecular permeability, which was accompanied by a decrease in the level of  apoptosis. together, these results suggest that lp-produced slap protects intestinal epithelial cells from epec-induced injury, likely through a mechanism  involving erk activation.

TI  == the puri family of expression vectors: a versatile set of ligation independent cloning plasmids for producing recombinant his-fusion proteins.
AB  == a family of restriction enzyme- and ligation-independent cloning vectors has been developed for producing recombinant his-tagged fusion proteins in escherichia coli. these are based on puri2 and puri3 expression vectors which have been previously used for the successful production of recombinant proteins at the milligram scale. the newly designed vectors combines two different promoters (lpp(p)-5 and t7 rna polymerase o10), two different endoprotease recognition sites for the his(6)-tag removal (enterokinase and tobacco etch virus), different antibiotic selectable markers (ampicillin and erythromycin resistance), and different placements of the his(6)-tag (n- and c-terminus). a single gene can be  cloned and further expressed in the eight puri vectors by using six nucleotide primers, avoiding the restriction enzyme and ligation steps. a unique noti site was introduced to facilitate the selection of the recombinant plasmid. as a case  study, the new vectors have been used to clone the gene coding for the phenolic acid decarboxylase from lactobacillus plantarum. interestingly, the obtained results revealed markedly different production levels of the target protein, emphasizing the relevance of the cloning strategy on soluble protein production yield. efficient purification and tag removal steps showed that the affinity tag  and the protease cleavage sites functioned properly. the novel family of puri vectors designed for parallel cloning is a useful and versatile tool for the production and purification of a protein of interest.

TI  == probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  == this study assessed potential probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. five lactobacillus isolates identified as lactobacillus reuteri  f03, lactobacillus paracasei f08, lactobacillus rhamnosus f14, lactobacillus plantarum c06, and lactobacillus acidophilus c11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. all the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to caco-2 cells, particularly, strain l. plantarum c06 and l. reuteri f03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain l. rhamnosus gg. the strains l. paracasei f08 and l. acidophilus c11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. all the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive (bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) pathogens. moreover, the strains l. reuteri f03, l. paracasei f08, and l. plantarum c06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/ml after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees c. the viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/ml after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees c. in the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. technologically interesting lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.

TI  == a new model for the effect of ph on microbial growth: an extension of the gamma hypothesis.
AB  == aims: to investigate the appropriateness of the extended lambert-pearson model (elpm) to model the effect of ph (as hydrogen and hydroxyl ions) over the whole biokinetic ph range in comparison with other available models. methods and results: data for the effect of ph on microbial growth were obtained from the literature or in-house. data were examined using several models for ph. models were compared using the residual mean of squares. using the elpm, ph was modelled as hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions; hence, the model was monotonic in each. the elpm was able to model data more successfully than the cardinal ph model (cpm) and other models in the majority of cases. conclusions: examining the effect of ph as hydrogen and hydroxyl ions has the advantage that the basic form of the elpm can be retained as each is treated as a distinct antimicrobial effect. with  the elpm, each inhibitor is described by two parameters; from these parameters, the ph(min) , ph(opt) and ph(max) can be obtained. furthermore, the idea of a dose response, absent from other models, becomes important. significance and impact of the study: the cpm is an excellent model for certain situations - where there is a high degree of symmetry between the suboptimal ph and superoptimal ph  response and where there are few data points available. the elpm is more amenable to highly asymmetric behaviour, especially where plateaus of effect around the ph optimum are observed and where the number of data points is not restrictive.

TI  == impedance biosensing using phages for bacteria detection: generation of dual signals as the clue for in-chip assay confirmation.
AB  == in the present work, we compare the use of antibodies (ab) and phages as bioreceptors for bacteria biosensing by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (eis). with this aim, both biocomponents have been immobilised in parallel onto interdigitated gold microelectrodes. the produced surfaces have been characterised by eis and fourier transform infra-red (ftir) spectroscopy and have been applied to bacteria detection. compared to immunocapture, detection using phages generates successive dual signals of opposite trend over time, which consist of an initial increase in impedance caused by bacteria capture followed by impedance decrease attributed to phage-induced lysis. such dual signals can be easily distinguished from those caused by non-specific adsorption and/or crossbinding, which helps to circumvent one of the main drawbacks of reagentless  biosensors based in a single target-binding event. the described strategy has generated specific detection of escherichia coli in the range of 10(4)-10(7) cfu  ml(-1) and minimal interference by non-target lactobacillus. we propose that the  utilisation of phages as capture biocomponent for bacteria capture and eis detection allows in-chip signal confirmation.

AB  == phenolic acids (benzoic, phenylacetic and phenylpropionic acids) are the most abundant phenolic structures found in fecal water. as an approach towards the exploration of their action in the gut, this paper reports the antimicrobial activity of thirteen phenolic acids towards escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the growth of e. coli atcc 25922 was inhibited by only four of the phenolic acids tested at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml, whereas pathogenic e. coli o157:h7 (cect 5947) was susceptible to ten of them. the genetically manipulated e. coli lpxc/tolc strain was highly susceptible to phenolic acids. the growth of lactobacilli (lactobacillus paraplantarum lch7, lactobacillus plantarum lch17, lactobacillus fermentum lph1, l. fermentum cect 5716, lactobacillus brevis lch23, and lactobacillus coryniformis cect 5711) and pathogens (s. aureus ep167 and c. albicans my1055) was also inhibited by phenolic acids, but to varying extents. only p. aeruginosa pao1 was not susceptible to any of the phenolic compounds tested. structure-activity relationships of phenolic acids and some of their diet precursors [(+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin] were established, based on multivariate analysis of microbial activities. the antimicrobial properties of phenolic acids reported in this paper might be relevant in vivo.

TI  == hydrolysis of tannic acid catalyzed by immobilized-stabilized derivatives of tannase from lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == a recombinant tannase from lactobacillus plantarum , overexpressed in escherichia coli , was purified in a single step by metal chelate affinity chromatography on  poorly activated nickel supports. it was possible to obtain 0.9 g of a pure enzyme by using only 20 ml of chromatographic support. the pure enzyme was immobilized and stabilized by multipoint covalent immobilization on highly activated glyoxyl agarose. derivatives obtained by multipoint and multisubunit immobilization were 500- and 1000-fold more stable than both the soluble enzyme and the one-point-immobilized enzyme in experiments of thermal and cosolvent inactivation, respectively. in addition, up to 70 mg of pure enzyme was immobilized on 1 g of wet support. the hydrolysis of tannic acid was optimized by using the new immobilized tannase derivative. the optimal reaction conditions were 30% diglyme at ph 5.0 and 4 degrees c. under these conditions, it was possible to obtain 47.5 mm gallic acid from 5 mm tannic acid as substrate. the product was pure as proved by hplc. on the other hand, the immobilized biocatalyst preserved >95% of its initial activity after 1 month of incubation under the optimal reaction conditions.

TI  == gene cloning, expression, and characterization of phenolic acid decarboxylase from lactobacillus brevis rm84.
AB  == phenolic acid decarboxylase (pad) catalyzes the synthesis of vinyl phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids. the gene encoding pad from lactobacillus brevis was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein in escherichia coli. the recombinant pad enzyme is a heat-labile enzyme that functions optimally at 22 degrees c and ph 6.0. the  purified enzyme did not show thermostability at temperatures above 22 degrees c.  l. brevis pad is able to decarboxylate exclusively the hydroxycinnamic acids, such as p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids, with k (m) values of 0.98, 0.96,  and 0.78 mm, respectively. the substrate specificity exhibited by l. brevis pad is similar to the pad isolated from bacillus subtilis and b. pumilus, but different from that of l. plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus. as the c-terminal region may be involved in determining pad substrate specificity and catalytic capacity, amino acid differences among these proteins could explain the differences observed. the substrate specificity shown by l. brevis pad shows promise for the synthesis of high-added value products from plant wastes.

TI  == inactivation of escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum in relation to membrane permeabilization due to rapid chilling followed by cold storage.
AB  == the relationship between membrane permeabilization and loss of viability by chilling depending on the chilling rate was investigated in two bacterial models: one gram-positive bacterium, lactobacillus plantarum, and one gram-negative bacterium, escherichia coli. cells were cold shocked slowly (2 degrees c/min) or  rapidly (2,000 degrees c/min) from physiological temperature to 0 degrees c and maintained at this temperature for up to 1 week. loss of membrane integrity was assessed by the uptake of the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (pi). cell death was found to be strongly dependent on the rate of temperature downshift to 0 degrees c. prolonged incubation of cells after the chilling emphasized the effect of treatment on the cells, as the amount of cell death increased with the length  of exposure to low temperature, particularly when cells were rapidly chilled. more than 5 and 3-log reductions in cell population were obtained with l. plantarum and e. coli after the rapid cold shock followed by 7-day storage, respectively. a correlation between cell inactivation and membrane permeabilization was demonstrated with both bacterial strains. thus, loss of membrane integrity due to the chilling treatments was directly involved in the inactivation of vegetative bacterial cells.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == characterization of a cryptic plasmid pd403 from lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid pd403 was isolated from lactobacillus plantarum d403 derived from fermented dairy products. it was 2,791 bp in size with a g+c content of 37%. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. orf1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (repa). orf2 (137  amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of ralstonia pickettii 12d. functional investigation indicated that orf2 (tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. the origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pd403 was a rolling-circle-replication (rcr) plasmid. an escherichia coli/lactobacillus shuttle vector pcd4032 was constructed based on the pd403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, and lactobacillus brevis. the transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram dna. furthermore, an expression vector pcd4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pcd4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.

AB  == aim: to assess sorption properties of spherocelle beads consisting of particles of macroporous celiulose with various charges in relation to bacterial cells of manufacturing probiotic strains from different taxonomic groups. materials and methods: the following manufacturing strains: bifidobacterium bifidum 1, lactobacillus plantarum 8pa-3 and escherichia coli m-17, as well as 3 variants of spherocelles' matrix: neutral, with positive and negative charges, were used. results: spherocelle globules deae with a positive charge of the matrix were successively used for designing of immobilized probiotic preparations. efficacy of sorbent is determined by sorption of > or =1000 viable cells as well as bacterial metabolites interacting in conditions of sorbent-regulated ph on each globule with diameter 100-180 microm. it provides, on the one hand, prolonged viability of probiotic bacteria in culture fluid within 6 months and, on the other hand, optimal pharmacokinetics of preparation due to gradual desorption of  metabolites from sorbent globules. conclusion: sorbent spherocell deae is biocompatible with cells of manufacturing strains of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and e. coli and recommended for designing of immobilized probiotics.

TI  == human intestinal microbiota: characterization of a simplified and stable gnotobiotic rat model.
AB  == the study of host microbe interactions is hampered by the complexity and inter-individual variability of the human gut microbiota. therefore, a simplified human intestinal microbiota (sihumi) consisting of seven bacterial species was introduced into germfree rats. species selection was based on numerical importance and fermentative abilities in the human gut. association of the rats with the sihumi (anaerostipes caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bifidobacterium longum, blautia producta, clostridium ramosum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum) resulted in increased faecal concentrations of short chain fatty acids compared to germfree animals. since the faecal butyrate concentration was low (0.9 +/- 0.5 micromol/g dry matter) the sihumi was complemented with clostridium butyricum. this extended bacterial community (sihumix) led to an increased faecal butyrate concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.7 micromol/g dry matter. besides forming scfa, the sihumix was capable of degrading mucins, beta-aspartylglycine and bilirubin. these features are characteristic of  conventional animals but not observed in germfree animals. dietary interventions  with modifications in fibre and fat content led to changes in the proportion of community members. the relative increase of one member of this community in response to a high-fat diet reflects the situation reported for obese mice and human subjects. the strength of the model communities is their remarkable stability over time and their easy transfer to the offspring.

TI  == control of directionality in bacteriophage mv4 site-specific recombination: functional analysis of the xis factor.
AB  == the integrase of the temperate bacteriophage mv4 catalyzes site-specific recombination between the phage attp site and the host attb site during lactobacillus delbrueckii lysogenization. the mv4 prophage is excised during the  induction of lytic growth. excisive site-specific recombination between the attr  and attl sites is also catalyzed by the phage-encoded recombinase, but the directionality of the recombination is determined by a second phage-encoded protein, the recombination directionality factor (rdf). we have identified and functionally characterized the rdf involved in site-specific excision of the prophage genome. the mv4 rdf, (mv4)xis, is encoded by the second gene of the early lytic operon. it is a basic protein of 56 amino acids. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that (mv4)xis binds specifically to the attp and attr sites via two dna-binding sites, introducing a bend into the dna. in vitro experiments and in vivo recombination assays with plasmids in escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum demonstrated that (mv4)xis is absolutely required for inter- or intramolecular recombination between the attr and attl sites. in contrast to the well-known phage site-specific recombination systems, the integrative recombination between the attp and attb sites seems not to be inhibited by the presence of (mv4)xis.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria differ in their ability to induce functional regulatory t cells in humans.
AB  == background: trials with probiotic lactic acid bacteria have yielded different results, which may be due to the strains used. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are known to be potent modulators of the immune system. the capacity of these bacteria used as probiotics to influence both t helper type 1 (th1)- and th2-mediated diseases has been shown before. however, the ability of strains to induce forkhead box p3 (foxp3(+)) expressing regulatory t cells has not yet been  investigated. objective: test the inherent differences between strains in their capacity to induce functional regulatory t cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). methods: human pbmc were co-cultured in vitro with either bifidobacterium lactis w51, lactobacillus acidophilus w55 or lactobacillus plantarum w62 or an escherichia coli control strain. the percentage of foxp3(+) cells, the origin of the induced cells and the functionality of these cells were  assessed. results probiotic strains differ in their capacity to induce regulatory t cells. foxp3(+) cells were induced from cd25(-) cells and were able to suppress effector t cells. naturally occurring regulatory t cells were not affected by co-culture with lactobacilli. il-10 concentrations found in the supernatant showed a trend towards the same differences between strains. blockade of il-10 did not influence the up-regulation of foxp3. no differences between lactic acid  bacteria were found in il-17, ifn-gamma or il-13. conclusions: some probiotic strains are potent inducers of regulatory cells, while others are not. the clear  differences between strains imply that an in vitro characterization of probiotic  strains before application is recommended.

TI  == effects of enteropathogenic bacteria & lactobacilli on chemokine secretion & toll like receptor gene expression in two human colonic epithelial cell lines.
AB  == background & objective: the intestinal epithelium is part of the innate immune system responding to contact with pathogenic or commensal bacteria. the objective of this study was to compare innate responses of intestinal epithelial cell lines to pathogenic bacteria and to lactobacilli. methods: two human intestinal epithelial cell lines, ht29 (enterocyte-like) and t84 (crypt-like), were exposed  to pathogenic bacteria representative of non invasive (vibrio cholerae o1 and o139), adherent (enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, ehec) or invasive (salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri) phenotypes and to non pathogenic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or lactobacillus plantarum. interleukin-8 (il-8) was measured in culture supernatant by elisa, while mrna from cells was subjected to  quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr for several other chemokines (cxcl1, ccl5  and cxcl5) and for toll-like receptors (tlr) 2, 4, 5 and 9. results: v. cholerae, s. typhimurium, s. flexneri and ehec induced il-8 secretion from epithelial cells into the medium. salmonella, shigella and ehec, but not v. cholerae, significantly increased mrna expression of cxcl1. none of the pathogens induced ccl5 or cxcl5. salmonella and vibrio significantly increased tlr4 expression, while vibrio and ehec decreased tlr5 expression. ehec also decreased tlr9 expression. lactobacilli attenuated the il-8 response of the cell lines to v. cholerae, salmonella, and ehec but did not significantly change the il-8 response to shigella. interpretation & conclusion: distinct patterns of epithelial cell chemokine responses were induced by the bacterial pathogens studied and these were modulated by commensal lactobacilli. alterations in tlr expression by these  pathogens are likely to be important in pathogenesis.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of lactobacillus plantarum dsmz 12028 as a probiotic: emphasis on innate immunity.
AB  == in this study, we analyzed the probiotic potential of l. plantarum dsmz 12028 in  vitro using the pathogen e. coli k4 and a certified probiotic, l. paracasei f19,  as controls. adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells was evaluated using two cell lines, caco-2 and ht-29, through the plate dilution method. moreover, the bacteria/epithelial dynamic interaction was continuously monitored using time-lapse microscopy. expression of the innate immunity receptors, the tlrs, was evaluated by semi-quantitative pcr on an epithelial/bacteria co-culture. real-time pcr was used to monitor expression of tlrs and cytokines in a monocytic cell line (thp-1) following bacterial exposure. the adherence of the strain to intestinal epithelial cells was comparable to that of the probiotic. time-lapse experiments showed that e. coli k4 induced cell death while l. plantarum did not  affect proliferation at a 10:1 bacteria/cell ratio. l. plantarum down-regulated tlr mrnas with the exception of tlr2, while l. paracasei f19 and e. coli k4 caused a significant (p<0.05) up-regulation of tlr2 and 4, respectively. to simulate the activation of underlying immune cells in the lamina propria, we analyzed the immunomodulation of l. plantarum on a monocytic cell line, thp-1. proinflammatory cytokines, such as tnfalpha, were increased by the presence of bacteria. the pathogen e. coli k4 also induced a strong up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as il8, il1beta and il23. no differences were observed between experimental groups for ifngamma, il-10 and il12p40. overall, l. plantarum dsmz 12028 demonstrated probiotic traits, inducing a proinflammatory response just above the "threshold level", which could prevent an inflammatory outcome, while inducing a higher state of alertness in the defense system of the  host intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == genome-wide analysis of signal peptide functionality in lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1.
AB  == background: lactobacillus plantarum is a normal, potentially probiotic, inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal (gi) tract. the bacterium has great potential as food-grade cell factory and for in situ delivery of biomolecules. since protein secretion is important both for probiotic activity and in biotechnological applications, we have carried out a genome-wide experimental study of signal peptide (sp) functionality. results: we have constructed a library of 76 sec-type signal peptides from l. plantarum wcfs1 that were predicted to be cleaved by signal peptidase i. sp functionality was studied using staphylococcal nuclease (nuca) as a reporter protein. 82% of the sps gave significant extracellular nuca activity. levels of secreted nuca varied by a dramatic 1800-fold and this variation was shown not to be the result of different mrna levels. for the best-performing sps all produced nuca was detected in the culture supernatant, but the secretion efficiency decreased for the less well performing sps. sequence analyses of the sps and their cognate proteins revealed  four properties that correlated positively with sp performance for nuca: high hydrophobicity, the presence of a transmembrane helix predicted by tmhmm, the absence of an anchoring motif in the cognate protein, and the length of the h+c domain. analysis of a subset of sps with a lactobacillal amylase (amya) showed large variation in production levels and secretion efficiencies. importantly, there was no correlation between sp performance with nuca and the performance with amya. conclusion: this is the first comprehensive experimental study showing that predicted sps in the l. plantarum genome actually are capable of driving protein secretion. the results reveal considerable variation between the sps that is at least in part dependent on the protein that is secreted. several sps stand  out as promising candidates for efficient secretion of heterologous proteins in l. plantarum. the results for nuca provide some hints as to the sequence-based prediction of sp functionality, but the general conclusion is that such prediction is difficult. the vector library generated in this study is based on exchangeable cassettes and provides a powerful tool for rapid experimental screening of sps.

TI  == inactivation of padr, the repressor of the phenolic acid stress response, by molecular interaction with usp1, a universal stress protein from lactobacillus plantarum, in escherichia coli.
AB  == the phenolic acid decarboxylase gene pada is involved in the phenolic acid stress response (pasr) in gram-positive bacteria. in lactobacillus plantarum, the padr gene encodes the negative transcriptional regulator of pada and is cotranscribed  with a downstream gene, usp1, which encodes a putative universal stress protein (usp), usp1, of unknown function. the usp1 gene is overexpressed during the pasr. however, the role and the mechanism of action of the usps are unknown in gram-positive bacteria. therefore, to gain insights into the role of usps in the  pasr; (i) a usp1 deletion mutant was constructed; (ii) the two genes padr and usp1 were coexpressed with pada under its own promoter as a reporter gene in escherichia coli; and (iii) molecular in vitro interactions between the padr, usp1, and the pada promoter were studied. although the usp1 mutant strain retained phenolic acid-dependent pad activity, it displayed a greater sensitivity to strong acidic conditions compared to that of the wild-type strain. padr cannot be inactivated directly by phenolic acid in e. coli recombinant cultures but is inactivated by usp1 when the two proteins are coexpressed in e. coli. the padr inactivation observed in recombinant e. coli cells was supported by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. although usp1 seems not to be absolutely required for the pasr, its capacity to inactivate padr indicates that it could serve as an important mediator in acid stress response mechanisms through its capacity to interact with transcriptional regulators.

AB  == the three-dimensional structures of the two peptides, plnj and plnk, that constitutes the two-peptide bacteriocin plantaricin jk have been solved in water/tfe and water/dpc-micellar solutions using nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. plnj, a 25 residue peptide, has an n-terminal amphiphilic alpha-helix between trp-3 and tyr-15. the 32 residues long plnk forms a central amphiphilic alpha-helix between gly-9 and leu-24. measurements of the effect on anti-microbial activity of single glycine replacements in plnj and plnk show that gly-13 and gly-17 in both peptides are very sensitive, giving more than a 100-fold reduction in activity when large residues replace glycine. in variants where other glycine residues, gly-20 in plnj and gly-7, gly-9, gly-24 and gly-25  in plnk, were replaced, the activity was reduced less than 10-fold. it is proposed that the detrimental effect on activity when exchanging gly-13 and gly-17 in plnj and plnk is a result of reduced ability of the two peptides to interact through the gxxxg-motifs constituting gly-13 and gly-17.

TI  == effects of lactobacillus plantarum ma2 isolated from tibet kefir on lipid metabolism and intestinal microflora of rats fed on high-cholesterol diet.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of lactobacillus plantarum ma2, an isolate from chinese traditional tibet kefir, on cholesterol-lowering and microflora of rat in vivo. rats were fed on cholesterol-enriched experimental diet, supplemented with lyophilized l. plantarum ma2 powder, with a dose of 10(11) cells/day per mice. the results showed that l. plantarum ma2 feeding significantly lowered serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides level, while  there was no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. in addition, liver total cholesterol and triglycerides was also decreased. however, fecal cholesterol and triglycerides was increased significantly (p < 0.05) in comparison with the control. also, l. plantarum ma2 increased the population of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the fecal, but it did not change the number of escherichia coli as compared to control. moreover, ph, moisture, and organic acids in the fecal were also measured. the present results indicate the probiotic potential of the l. plantarum ma2 strain in hypocholesterolemic effect  and also increasing the probiotic count in the intestine.

TI  == physiological and biochemical characterization of the two alpha-l-rhamnosidases of lactobacillus plantarum ncc245.
AB  == this work is believed to be the first report on the physiological and biochemical characterization of alpha-l-rhamnosidases in lactic acid bacteria. a total of 216 strains representing 37 species and eight genera of food-grade bacteria were screened for alpha-l-rhamnosidase activity. the majority of positive bacteria (25 out of 35) were lactobacillus plantarum strains, and activity of the l. plantarum strain ncc245 was examined in more detail. the analysis of alpha-l-rhamnosidase activity under different growth conditions revealed dual regulation of the enzyme activity, involving carbon catabolite repression and induction: the enzyme activity was downregulated by glucose and upregulated by l-rhamnose. the expression of the two alpha-l-rhamnosidase genes rhab1 and rhab2 and two predicted permease genes rhap1 and rhap2, identified in a probable operon rhap2b2p1b1, was repressed by glucose and induced by l-rhamnose, showing regulation at the transcriptional level. the two alpha-l-rhamnosidase genes were  overexpressed and purified from escherichia coli. rhab1 activity was maximal at 50 degrees c and at neutral ph and rhab2 maximal activity was detected at 60 degrees c and at ph 5, with high residual activity at 70 degrees c. both enzymes  showed a preference for the alpha-1,6 linkage of l-rhamnose to beta-d-glucose, hesperidin and rutin being their best substrates, but, surprisingly, no activity  was detected towards the alpha-1,2 linkage in naringin under the tested conditions. in conclusion, we identified and characterized the strain l. plantarum ncc245 and its two alpha-l-rhamnosidase enzymes, which might be applied for improvement of bioavailability of health-beneficial polyphenols, such as hesperidin, in humans.

TI  == neonatal cord blood subsets and cytokine response to bacterial antigens.
AB  == we compared lymphocyte subsets and cytokine responses to bacteria among term, preterm infants, and adults. lymphocyte subset percentages in cord blood (22 preterm, 27 term neonates) and peripheral blood from 21 adults and cytokine/chemokine interleukin (il)-6, il-8, il-10, il-12, interferon gamma (ifn  gamma) responses to escherichia coli, group b streptococcus (gbs), staphylococcus epidermidis, and lactobacillus plantarum (lp299v) were assessed by flow cytometry. preterm compared with term infants had increased cd8 (+) t cells (p =  0.02) and reduced naive cd4 (+) t cells (p < 0.0001). memory t and natural killer (nk) t cells were reduced (p < 0.001) in neonates; nk and cd56 (+)161 (+) nk cells were increased (p < 0.001). cd56 (+)cd8 (+) nk cells were higher in preterm compared with term infants. despite individual exceptions, cytokine responses in  neonates were weaker than adults except for il-8 response to e. coli in preterm and il-12 response to lp299v in term infants. il-10 responses were weaker in preterm (p = 0.01) and term (p = 0.005) infants to s. epidermidis and to e. coli  (p = 0.03 for both) compared with adults. differences in regulatory subpopulations of nk and t cells between neonates and adults and term compared with preterm infants were observed. these differences rather than intrinsic functional deficiency may account for neonatal cytokine responses to bacteria.

TI  == characterization of four plasmids harboured in a lactobacillus brevis strain encoding a novel bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, and construction of a shuttle vector for lactic acid bacteria and escherichia coli.
AB  == in this study we isolated over 250 lactic acid bacteria (lab) candidates from fruit, flowers, vegetables and a fermented food to generate an lab library. one strain, designated 925a, isolated from kimchi (a traditional korean fermented dish made from chinese cabbage) produced a novel type of bacteriocin, brevicin 925a, which is effective against certain lab, including strains of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, bacillus and listeria. strain 925a, identified as lactobacillus brevis, harboured at least four plasmids and we determined the entire nucleotide sequence of each one. the four plasmids were designated plb925a01-04, and have molecular sizes of 1815, 3524, 8881 and 65 037 bp, respectively. we obtained bacteriocin non-producing derivatives by treatment of strain 925a with novobiocin. all of these derivatives, which were susceptible to  their own antibacterial product, lost the largest plasmid, plb925a04, suggesting  that the genes for bacteriocin biosynthesis (breb and brec) and immunity (bree) are located on plb925a04. the partial amino acid sequence of purified brevicin 925a and sequence analysis of plb925a04 showed that breb is the structural gene for brevicin 925a. we constructed a shuttle vector (ples003, 6134 bp) that can replicate in both escherichia coli and lab such as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus hilgardii and enterococcus hirae. to determine the function of gene bree, which displays no significant similarity  to any other sequences in the blast search database, the gene was inserted into ples003. a plb925a04-cured derivative transformed with ples003 carrying bree acquired immunity to brevicin 925a, suggesting that bree encodes an immunity protein.

TI  == characterization of rhamnosidases from lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus  acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacilli are known to use plant materials as a food source. many such materials are rich in rhamnose-containing polyphenols, and thus it can be anticipated that lactobacilli will contain rhamnosidases. therefore, genome sequences of food-grade lactobacilli were screened for putative rhamnosidases. in the genome of lactobacillus plantarum, two putative rhamnosidase genes (ram1(lp)  and ram2(lp)) were identified, while in lactobacillus acidophilus, one rhamnosidase gene was found (rama(la)). gene products from all three genes were produced after introduction into escherichia coli and were then tested for their  enzymatic properties. ram1(lp), ram2(lp), and rama(la) were able to efficiently hydrolyze rutin and other rutinosides, while rama(la) was, in addition, able to cleave naringin, a neohesperidoside. subsequently, the potential application of lactobacillus rhamnosidases in food processing was investigated using a single matrix, tomato pulp. recombinant ram1(lp) and rama(la) enzymes were shown to remove the rhamnose from rutinosides in this material, but efficient conversion required adjustment of the tomato pulp to ph 6. the potential of ram1(lp) for fermentation of plant flavonoids was further investigated by expression in the food-grade bacterium lactococcus lactis. this system was used for fermentation of tomato pulp, with the aim of improving the bioavailability of flavonoids in processed tomato products. while import of flavonoids into l. lactis appeared to  be a limiting factor, rhamnose removal was confirmed, indicating that rhamnosidase-producing bacteria may find commercial application, depending on the technological properties of the strains and enzymes.

TI  == l. plantarum prevents enteroinvasive escherichia coli-induced tight junction proteins changes in intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == background: it is increasingly recognized that lactobacillus plantarum (l. plantarum) has the ability to protect against enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec)-induced damage of the epithelial monolayer barrier function by preventing  changes in host cell morphology, attaching/effacing (a/e) lesion formation, monolayer resistance, and macromolecular permeability. however, the cellular mechanism involved in this protective effect still remained to be clarified. methods: this study was to investigate the effect of l. plantarum on the changes  of caco-2 cells responding to enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec), the permeability of cell monolayer and the transmissivity of dextran, and the distribution and expression of the tight junction (tj) proteins, such as claudin-1, occludin, jam-1 and zo-1 were examined when infected with eiec or adhesived of l. plantarum after infection by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), immunohistochemistry and western blotting, the cytoskeleton protein f-actin were observed with fitc-phalloidin. results: this study demonstrated that the transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) step down and dextran integrated  intensity (dii) step up with time after infected with eiec, but after treating with l. plantarum, the changes of ter and dii were improved as compared with eiec group. l. plantarum prevented the damage of expression and rearrangement of claudin-1, occludin, jam-1 and zo-1 proteins induced by eiec, and could ameliorate the injury of cytoskeleton protein f-actin infected with eiec. conclusion: l. plantarum exerted a protective effect against the damage to integrity of caco-2 monolayer cells and the structure and distribution of tj proteins by eiec infection.

TI  == characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  == the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited  red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while  the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this  paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.

TI  == selection of lactic acid bacteria from fermented plant beverages to use as inoculants for improving the quality of the finished product.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented plant beverages were selected based on  their antibacterial actions against potential food borne pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus psscmi 0004, escherichia coli psscmi 0001, salmonella typhimurium psscmi 0034 and vibrio parahaemolyticus vp 4). antibacterial activities were measured using an agar spot method. the lactobacillus plantarum w90a strain isolated from a wild forest noni (morinda coreia ham) beverage was used as an inoculant. three different inoculation procedures were conducted with  the fruit of wild forest noni fermentations to establish which one was the best for controlling the numbers of yeast in the finished product. a 5% inoculum of l. plantarum w90a (lab set), initial cell density 8.6 log cfu ml(-1), produced a better product and inhibitory properties against the test organisms, particularly e. coli psscmi 0001 than one with no inoculum or with a 5% inoculum from a previous natural fermented product. an lab inoculum resulted in a reduced total bacterial count and no yeast throughout fermentation period (90 days). the lower  yeast resulted in a reduction of the ethanol content to 2.9 g l(-1) compared to 12.2 g l(-1) inthe culture with no inoculum. the highest acidity (1.3-1.4%) with  the same ph (3.3) was observed in both sets of inoculated fermentations, whereas  the uninoculated set gave a ph value of 3.7 (1.2% acidity).

TI  == binding and cellular activation studies reveal that toll-like receptor 2 can differentially recognize peptidoglycan from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == although much progress has been made toward the identification of innate immune receptors, far less is known about how these receptors recognize specific microbial products. such studies have been hampered by the need to purify compounds from microbial sources and a reliance on biological assays rather than  direct binding to monitor recognition. we have employed surface plasmon resonance (spr) binding studies using a wide range of well defined synthetic muropeptides derived from gram-positive (lysine-containing) and gram-negative (diaminopimelic  acid (dap)-containing) bacteria to demonstrate that toll-like receptor 2 can recognize peptidoglycan (pgn). in the case of lysine-containing muropeptides, a limited number of compounds, which were derived from pgn remodeled by bacterial autolysins, was recognized. however, a wider range of dap-containing muropeptides was bound with high affinity, and these compounds were derived from nascent and remodeled pgn. the difference in recognition of the two classes of muropeptides is proposed to be a strategy by the host to respond appropriately to gram-negative and -positive bacteria, which produce vastly different quantities of pgn. it was also found that certain modifications of the carboxylic acids of isoglutamine and dap can dramatically reduce binding, and thus, bacterial strains may employ such modifications to evade innate immune detection. cellular activation studies employing highly purified pgn from bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus support the structure binding relationship. the data firmly establish toll-like receptor 2 as an innate immune sensor for pgn and provides an understanding of host-pathogen interactions at the molecular level.

TI  == characterization of gene encoding amylopullulanase from plant-originated lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus plantarum l137.
AB  == a starch-hydrolyzing lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus plantarum l137, was isolated from traditional fermented food made from fish and rice in the philippines. a gene (apua) encoding an amylolytic enzyme from lactobacillus plantarum l137 was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. the apua gene consisted of an open reading frame of 6171 bp encoding a protein of 2056 amino acids, the molecular mass of which was calculated to be 215,625 da. the catalytic domains of amylase and pullulanase were located in the same region within the middle of the n-terminal region. the deduced amino acid sequence revealed four highly conserved regions that are common among amylolytic enzymes.  in the n-terminal region, a six-amino-acid sequence (asp-ala/thr-ala-asn-ser-thr) is repeated 39 times, and a three-amino-acid sequence (gln-pro-thr) is repeated 50 times in the c-terminal region. the apua gene was subcloned in l. plantarum ncl21, which is a plasmid-cured derivative of the wild-type l137 strain and has no amylopullulanase activity, and the gene was overexpressed under the control of its own promoter. the apua enzyme from this recombinant l. plantarum ncl21 harboring apua gene was purified. the enzyme has both alpha-amylase and pullulanase activities. the n-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme showed that the signal peptide was cleaved at ala(36) and the molecular mass of the mature extracellular enzyme is 211,537 da. the major reaction products from soluble starch were maltotriose (g3) and maltotetraose (g4). only maltotriose (g3) was produced from pullulan. from these results, we concluded that apua is an amylolytic enzyme belonging to the amylopullulanase family.

TI  == enhanced inactivation of foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria by fd&c red no. 3 and other xanthene derivatives during ultrahigh pressure processing.
AB  == variability among microorganisms in barotolerance has been demonstrated at genus, species, and strain levels. identification of conditions and additives that enhance the efficacy of ultrahigh pressure (uhp) against important foodborne microorganisms is crucial for maximizing product safety and stability. preliminary work indicated that fd&c red no. 3 (red 3), a xanthene derivative, was bactericidal and acted synergistically with uhp against lactobacillus spp. the objective of this study was to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of red 3  and other xanthene derivatives, alone and combined with uhp, against spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in citrate-phosphate buffer (ph 7.0). xanthene derivatives tested were fluorescein, eosin y, erythrosin b, phloxine b, red 3, and rose bengal. halogenated xanthene derivatives (10 ppm) were effective at reducing listeria monocytogenes survivors but ineffective against escherichia coli o157:h7. when combined with uhp (400 mpa, 3 min), the presence of derivatives enhanced inactivation. because red 3 was the only xanthene derivative to produce  synergistic inactivation of both pathogens, further studies using this colorant were warranted. efficacy of red 3 against gram-positive bacteria (lactobacillus plantarum and l. monocytogenes) was concentration dependent (1 to 10 ppm). e. coi o157: h7 strains were resistant to red 3 concentrations up to 300 ppm. when red 3 was combined with uhp, the lethality against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was dose dependent, with synergy being significant for most strains at > or = 3 ppm. additional gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria showed lethalities similar to those observed for l. plantarum or l. monocytogenes, and e. coli o157:h7, respectively. red 3 is a potentially useful additive to enhance  the safety and stability of uhp-treated food products.

AB  == synbiotics are recognized means of modulating gut microbiota composition and activities. however, whether synbiotics are superior to prebiotics and probiotics alone in moderating the gut microbiota towards a purportedly healthy composition  has not been determined. eight selected synbiotics (short-chain fructooligosaccharides or fructooligosaccharides, each combined with one of four  probiotics, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1, lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2 or bifidobacterium longum 46) were added to 24-h ph-controlled anaerobic faecal batch cultures. the prebiotic and probiotic components were also tested alone to determine their respective role within the synbiotic for modulation of the faecal microbiota. effects upon major groups of the microbiota were evaluated using fish. rifampicin variant probiotic strains were used to assess probiotic levels. synbiotic and prebiotics increased bifidobacteria and the eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides group. lower levels of escherichia coli were retrieved with these combinations after 5 and 10  h of fermentation. probiotics alone had little effect upon the groups, however. multivariate analysis revealed that the effect of synbiotics differed from the prebiotics as higher levels of lactobacillus-enterococcus were observed when the  probiotic was stimulated by the prebiotic component. here, the synbiotic approach was more effective than prebiotic or probiotic alone to modulate the gut microbiota.

TI  == identification and cloning of a gene encoding tannase (tannin acylhydrolase) from lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t).
AB  == the gene tanlpl, encoding a novel tannase enzyme (tanlpl), has been cloned from lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917(t). this is the first report of a tannase gene cloned from a bacterial source other than from staphylococcus lugdunensis, which  has been reported elsewhere. the open reading frame of tanlpl, spanning 1410 bp,  encoded a 469-amino-acid protein that showed 28.8% identity to the tannase of s.  lugdunensis with several commonly conserved sequences. these sequences could not  be found in putative tannases reported for other bacteria and fungi. tanlpl was expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha from a pgem-t expression system and purified. sds-page analysis indicated that purified tanlpl was a monomer polypeptide of approximately 50 kda in size. subsequent enzymatic characterization revealed that tanlpl was most active in an alkaline ph range at  40 degrees c, which was quite different from that observed for a fungal tannase of aspergillus oryzae. in addition, the michaelis-menten constant of tanlpl was markedly lower than that of a. oryzae tannase. the evidence suggests that tanlpl  should be classified into a novel family of tannases.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == a simple method to generate chromosomal mutations in lactobacillus plantarum strain tf103 to eliminate undesired fermentation products.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria have been explored to convert lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel and bioproducts. our long-term goal is to create genetically engineered lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains that convert agricultural biomass into ethanol and other value-added products. the immediate approaches toward this goal involve genetic manipulations by either introducing ethanol production pathway genes or inactivating pathways genes that lead to production of undesired byproducts. the  widely studied species lactobacillus plantarum is now considered a model for genetic manipulations of lab. in this study, l. plantarum tf103 strain, in which  two of the chromosomal l-ldh and d-ldh genes are inactivated, was used to introduce additional mutations on the chromosome to eliminate undesired fermentation products. we targeted the acetolactate synthase gene (als) that converts pyruvate to acetolactate, to eliminate the production of acetoin and 2,3-butanodial. a pbluescript derivative containing sections of the als coding region and an erythromycin resistance gene was directly introduced into l. plantarum tf103 cells to create mutations under selection pressure. the resulting erythromycin resistant (em(r)) tf103 strain appears to have chromosomal mutations of both the als and the adjacent lysp genes as revealed by polymerase chain reaction and southern blot analyses. mutations were thus generated via targeted homologous recombination using a gram-negative cloning vector, eliminating the use of a shuttle vector. this method should facilitate research in targeted inactivation of other genes in lab.

TI  == interaction of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains with human intestinal epithelial cells: adhesion properties, competition against enteropathogens and modulation of il-8 production.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human nutrition and health by promoting the supply of nutrients, preventing pathogen colonization and shaping and maintaining normal mucosal immunity. the depletion of the individual  microbiota can result in a higher susceptibility to enteropathogenic bacteria infection. in order to reduce this risk, the use of food supplements containing probiotic bacteria has been recently addressed. in this paper, we investigate the protective role toward enteropathogen infection of probiotic strains belonging to lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. according to our experimental data, lactobacillus acidophilus bar13, l. plantarum bar10, bifidobacterium longum bar33 and b. lactis bar30 were effective in displacing the enteropathogens salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli h10407 from a caco-2 cell layer. moreover, l. acidophilus bar13 and b. longum bar33 have been assessed for their immunomodulatory activity on il-8 production by ht29 cells. both strains showed the potential to protect enterocytes from an acute inflammatory response. these probiotic strains are potential candidates for the development of new functional  foods helpful in counteracting enteropathogen infections.

TI  == characterization of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains: potential use as probiotic.
AB  == considering that several health promoting properties are associated with kefir consumption and a reliable probiotic product requires a complete identification of the bacterial species, the present work evaluates several proved markers of probiotic potential of eleven isolates of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated  from kefir grains and molecular identification and genotypic diversity. using restriction analysis of amplified ribosomal dna (ardra) and analysis of the 16s-23s rrna internal spacer region we confirmed that all homofermentative lactobacilli belong to the species lactobacillus plantarum. rapd-pcr analysis allowed the discrimination of lactobacilli in five clusters. all isolates exhibited high resistance to bile salt. high survival after one hour of exposure  to ph 2.5 was observed in lb. plantarum cidca 8313, 83210, 8327 and 8338. all isolates were hydrophilic and non autoaggregative. isolate cidca 8337 showed the  highest percentage of adhesion among strains. all tested lactobacilli had strong  inhibitory power against salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. seven out of eleven isolates showed inhibition against sal. enterica and five isolates were effective against sal. gallinarum. only cidca 8323 and cidca 8327 were able to inhibit sal. sonnei. we did not find any correlation between the five clusters based on rapd-pcr and the probiotic properties, suggesting that these isolates have unique characteristics.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == cloning, expression, purification, cofactor requirements, and steady state kinetics of phosphoketolase-2 from lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == the genes xpk1 and xpk2(delta1-21) encoding phosphoketolase-1 and (delta1-7)-truncated phosphoketolase-2 have been cloned from lactobacillus plantarum and expressed in escherichia coli. both gene-products display phosphoketolase activity on fructose-6-phosphate in extracts. a n-terminal his-tag construct of xpk2(delta1-21) was also expressed in e. coli and produced active his-tagged (delta1-7)-truncated phosphoketolase-2 (hereafter phosphoketolase-2). phosphoketolase-2 is activated by thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp) and the divalent metal ions mg(2+), mn(2+), or ca(2+). kinetic analysis and data from the literature indicate the activators are mgtpp, mntpp, or catpp, and  these species activate by an ordered equilibrium binding pathway, with me(2+)tpp  binding first and then fructose-6-phosphate. phosphoketolase-2 accepts either fructose-6-phosphate or xylulose-5-phosphate as substrates, together with inorganic phosphate, to produce acetyl phosphate and either erythrose-4-phosphate or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, respectively. steady state kinetic analysis of acetyl phosphate formation with either substrate indicates a ping pong kinetic mechanism. product inhibition patterns with erythrose-4-phosphate indicate that an intermediate in the ping pong mechanism is formed irreversibly. background mechanistic information indicates that this intermediate is 2-acetyl-tpp. the irreversibility of 2-acetyl-tpp formation might explain the overall irreversibility of the reaction of phosphoketolase-2.

TI  == lactobacilli antagonize biological effects of enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli in vitro.
AB  == aims: to assess the effect of two lactobacilli on the biological activity of enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) in vitro. methods and results: strains cidca 133 (lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and cidca 83114 (lactobacillus plantarum) were studied. hep-2 cells were used as an in vitro model to assess the biological effect of a clinical isolate of ehec. preincubation of cell monolayers with lactobacilli before ehec prevented detachment of eukaryotic cells and minimizes both f-actin rearrangements and morphological alterations. interestingly, the protective effect could not be ascribed to pathogen exclusion. in addition, viability of the lactobacilli was not necessary for protection and other species of the genus lactobacillus failed  to protect eukaryotic cells. conclusions: our results suggest that lactobacilli are antagonizing virulence mechanisms of ehec either by modification of the microenvironment or by interfering with the signalling cascades triggered by the  pathogen. significance and impact of the study: our findings give a rationale basis for the use of specific probiotic strains for the prophylaxis and prevention of intestinal infections due to ehec.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

AB  == background: neonatal susceptibility to bacterial infection is associated with an  immature immune system, but the role of different bacterial antigens in specific  responses is largely unknown. objective: to evaluate differences in intracellular cytokine response to physiologically relevant bacterial antigens in term and preterm infants as compared with adults. methods: cord blood samples from preterm and term neonates and adult peripheral blood samples were cultured ex vivo with and without whole heat-killed bacteria. intracellular leukocyte production of interleukin (il)-6, il-10, il-12, and il-8 responses was assessed by flow cytometry. results: monocytes were the primary producers of all mediators. escherichia coli was the most potent stimulant. lactobacillus plantarum 299v activated fewer monocytes as compared with e. coli for all responses (p < 0.05),  except for il-12 in term neonates. il-6 response to staphylococcus epidermidis was lower in both groups of neonates as compared with adults (p = 0.023 and p = 0.001). il-8 response to s. epidermidis was lower in term as compared with preterm neonates and adults (p = 0.003). il-10 response to group b streptococci was lower in term neonates as compared with adults and higher in preterm as compared with term neonates (p = 0.015). conclusions: monocytes from term neonates compared to preterm neonates show a downregulated anti-inflammatory response to specific bacteria. high neonatal response to pathogenic e. coli in the preterm infant could cause uncontrolled inflammatory response, while lower il-6 response to s. epidermidis in neonates may indicate a basis for vulnerability to s. epidermidis infection.

TI  == effect of relative inoculum concentration on listeria monocytogenes growth in co-culture.
AB  == growth suppression of multi-species bacterial populations in batch cultures by a  single 'dominant' strain has been referred to in the literature as the 'jameson effect'. the effect is often attributed to production of specific inhibitors of growth by one species against another. to explore its basis, we hypothesised that the jameson effect is often a non-specific interaction and that growth inhibition of species in co-culture can be controlled by manipulation of inoculum concentration and growth rate so as to enable a selected species to achieve stationary phase first. the hypothesis was assessed by co-culturing pairs of bacterial species under conditions selected to ensure that both strains grew at a similar rate and manipulating the initial concentration of each species. specifically, the effect of inoculum concentration on the growth kinetics of listeria monocytogenes when co-cultured in complex laboratory media with escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens or a commercial strain of the lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus plantarum, was studied. starting numbers of the second strain were either higher than ( approximately 10(6) cfu ml(-1)), equal to ( approximately 10(4) cfu ml(-1)) or lower than ( approximately 10(3) cfu ml(-1)) l. monocytogenes. in most trials, the initial inoculum concentration governed which species became dominant and suppressed the growth of the other strain. l. monocytogenes was suppressed by all other strains when its inoculum level was lower. conversely, when l. monocytogenes was initially present at higher concentration than either p. fluorescens or l. plantarum, their growth was suppressed. e. coli, however, was not suppressed by l. monocytogenes even when the e. coli density was initially lower. while simple competition for nutrients could explain most of the observations, in some co-culture experiments ph reduction also seemed to play a role in inhibition of growth of some species. in  other cases, available growth substrates were apparently not utilised by both co-cultured species, and the jameson effect did not occur. thus, while it appears that under many conditions the jameson effect may be largely due to non-specific  inhibition, more complex interactions between co-cultured strains involving species-specific ph limits for growth and differential utilisation of growth substrates may also occur and confound the simple jameson effect.

TI  == many fructosamine 3-kinase homologues in bacteria are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases potentially involved in protein deglycation.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to identify the function of bacterial homologues of  fructosamine 3-kinase (fn3k), a mammalian enzyme responsible for the removal of fructosamines from proteins. fn3k homologues were identified in approximately 200 (i.e. approximately 27%) of the sequenced bacterial genomes. in 11 of these genomes, from phylogenetically distant bacteria, the fn3k homologue was immediately preceded by a low-molecular-weight protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (lmw-ptp) homologue, which is therefore probably functionally related to the fn3k homologue. five bacterial fn3k homologues (from escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, staphylococcus aureus and thermus thermophilus) were overexpressed in e. coli, purified and their kinetic properties investigated. four were ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases acting best on free lysine and cadaverine derivatives, but not on ribulosamines bound to the alpha amino group of amino acids. they also phosphorylated protein-bound ribulosamines or erythrulosamines, but not protein-bound fructosamines, therefore having properties similar to those of mammalian fn3k-related protein. the e. coli fn3k homologue (ynia) was inactive on all tested substrates. the lmw-ptp of t. thermophilus, which forms an operon with an fn3k homologue, and an lmw-ptp of s.  aureus (ptpa) were overexpressed in e. coli, purified and shown to dephosphorylate not only protein tyrosine phosphates, but protein ribulosamine 5-phosphates as well as free ribuloselysine 5-phosphate and erythruloselysine 4-phosphate. these lmw-ptps were devoid of ribulosamine 3-phosphatase activity. it is concluded that most bacterial fn3k homologues are ribulosamine/erythrulosamine 3-kinases. they may serve, in conjunction with a phosphatase, to deglycate products of glycation formed from ribose 5-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate.

TI  == probiotics potentiate il-6 production in il-1beta-treated caco-2 cells through a  heat shock-dependent mechanism.
AB  == il-6 may exert anti-inflammatory and protective effects in intestinal mucosa and  enterocytes. the influence of probiotics on mucosal and enterocyte il-6 production is not known. we tested the hypothesis that the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum regulate il-6 production in intestinal epithelial cells. cultured caco-2 cells were treated with 1 ng/ml of il-1beta in the absence or presence of different concentrations of l. paracasei or l. plantarum followed by measurement of il-6 production. the role of heat shock response was examined by determining the expression of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) and hsp27, by downregulating their expression with small interfering rna (sirna), or by treating cells with quercetin. treatment of the caco-2 cells with il-1beta resulted in increased il-6 production, confirming previous reports  from this laboratory. probiotics alone did not influence il-6 production, but the addition of probitoics to il-1beta-treated cells resulted in a substantial augmentation of il-6 production. treatment of the caco-2 cells with live l. paracasei increased cellular levels of hsp70 and hsp27 and the potentiating effect on il-6 production was inhibited by quercetin and by hsp70 or hsp27 sirna. results suggest that probiotics may enhance il-6 production in enterocytes subjected to an inflammatory stimulus and that this effect may, at least in part, be heat shock dependent.

TI  == quorum-sensing based bacteriocin production is down-regulated by n-terminally truncated species of gene activators.
AB  == down-regulation of quorum-sensing based pathways is an important but yet poorly understood process in bacterial gene regulation. in this study, we show that the  gene regulator plnc not only acts as an activator gene in the quorum-sensing based bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum c11, but it also concurrently codes for truncated forms that were shown to repress bacteriocin production. by amino acid n-terminal sequencing and dna sequence analysis, the truncated species of plnc are believed to be translated from alternative start codons located in the so-called receiver domain of the regulator. to analyse the  structure-function relationship of truncated species of plnc, we performed a series of systematic truncation mutations: ten in the receiver domain, one in the hinge region and two in the c-terminal dna-binding domain. it was revealed that any truncation mutation containing a disrupted receiver domain together with an intact dna-binding domain displayed a repressive effect on bacteriocin production. such a gene repression mechanism mediated by truncated regulators was also found in two other quorum-sensing based bacteriocin systems (spp in l. sakei lth673 and nc8-pln in l. plantarum nc8), suggesting that this mode of repression  might represent a common means applied by bacteria to down-regulate certain quorum-sensing based pathways.

TI  == functional expression of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes in escherichia coli for conversion of glucose to p-hydroxystyrene.
AB  == the chemical monomer p-hydroxystyrene (phs) is used for producing a number of important industrial polymers from petroleum-based feedstocks. in an alternative  approach, the microbial production of phs can be envisioned by linking together a number of different metabolic pathways, of which those based on using glucose for carbon and energy are currently the most economical. the biological process conserves petroleum when glucose is converted to the aromatic amino acid l-tyrosine, which is deaminated by a tyrosine/phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (pal/tal) enzyme to yield p-hydroxycinnamic acid (phca). subsequent decarboxylation of phca gives rise to phs. bacteria able to efficiently decarboxylate phca to phs using a phca decarboxylase (pdc) include bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas fluorescens and lactobacillus plantarum. both b. subtilis and l. plantarum possess high levels of phca-inducible decarboxylase activity and were chosen for further studies. the genes encoding pdc in these organisms were cloned and the phca decarboxylase expressed in escherichia coli strains co-transformed with a plasmid encoding a bifunctional pal/tal enzyme from the yeast rhodotorula glutinis. production of phs from glucose was ten-fold greater for the expressed l. plantarum pdc gene (0.11mm), compared to that obtained when  the b. subtilis pdc gene (padc) was used. an e. coli strain (wwq51.1) expressing  both tyrosine ammonia-lyase(pal) and phca decarboxylase (pdc), when grown in a 14l fermentor and under phosphate limited conditions, produced 0.4g/l of phs from glucose. we, therefore, demonstrate phs production from an inexpensive carbohydrate feedstock by fermentation using a novel metabolic pathway comprising genes from e. coli, l. plantarum and r. glutinis.

AB  == the substrate-inducible p-coumaric acid decarboxylase (pdc) from lactobacillus plantarum has been overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified and confirmed to possess decarboxylase activity. the recombinant his(6)-tagged enzyme was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method from a solution containing 20%(w/v) peg 4000, 12%(w/v) 2-propanol, 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m tris-hcl ph 8.0 with 0.1 m barium chloride as an additive. diffraction data were  collected in-house to 2.04 a resolution. crystals belonged to the tetragonal space group p4(3), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 43.15, c = 231.86 a. the estimated matthews coefficient was 2.36 a(3) da(-1), corresponding to 48% solvent content, which is consistent with the presence of two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. the structure of pdc has been determined by the molecular-replacement method. currently, the structure of pdc complexed with substrate analogues is in progress, with the aim of elucidating the structural basis of the catalytic mechanism.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of several herb and spice extracts in culture medium and in vacuum-packaged pork.
AB  == extracts prepared from honeysuckle, scutellaria, forsythia suspensa (thunb), cinnamon, and rosemary with 75% ethanol and from clove oil dissolved in 75% ethanol were applied to inoculated agar media to observe their inhibitory effects on the growth of escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, and lactobacillus plantarum. all the extracts suppressed the growth of these bacteria; scutellaria  exhibited the strongest effect against e. coli. an orthogonal test revealed that  the most effective antimicrobial composite extracts were equal-volume mixtures of 0.125 g/ml scutellaria + 0.5 g/ml honeysuckle + 0.125 g/ml forsythia + 0.25 g/ml  cinnamon and 0.25 g/ml cinnamon + 0.125 g/ml rosemary + 0.25% clove oil. these mixed extracts also produced strong antimicrobial effects in vacuum-packaged fresh pork, with 1.81- to 2.32-log reductions in microbial counts compared with the control when stored for up to 28 days. the sensory panel detected minimal differences in surface color and off-odors between meat samples treated with herb-spice extracts and the control. these results indicate that combined herb and spice extracts can be used as natural antimicrobials for food preservation.

TI  == use of the gfp gene in monitoring bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus plantarum n014, a potential starter culture in nham fermentation.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum n014 is a bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria originally isolated from nham, a traditional thai fermented sausage, and in the process of development to be used as a starter culture for nham fermentation. during the fermentation process, there is a need to identify the starter culture  among several naturally occurring bacteria. in this study, a new plasmid carrying the gfp (green fluorescent protein) gene was constructed based on pgkv210, an escherichia coli/ lactococcus shuttle vector containing an erythromycin resistance marker. the gfp gene derived from pgfpuv was placed under the control  of an l-lactate dehydrogenase promoter and then inserted at the ecori site of pgkv210, leading to pn014-gfp. the novel plasmid was used to transform l. plantarum n014, which is a bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from nham. the resulting transformant, l. plantarum n014-gfp+, was brightly fluorescent and harbored the expected plasmid. a plasmid stability test revealed  that pn014-gfp was stable after 100 generations of growth under nonselective pressure. l. plantarum n014-gfp+ and its parent strain were shown to be very similar in growth rate, bacteriocin production, and lactate production. l. plantarum n014-gfp+ was able to survive in a nham model. the survival clones were still fluorescent and harbored pn014-gfp.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

TI  == limitations in the use of drosophila melanogaster as a model host for gram-positive bacterial infection.
AB  == aims: to examine sensitivities of various drosophila melanogaster strains towards human pathogenic and nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria. methods and results: the d. melanogaster oregon r strain was infected by injecting the thorax with a needle containing escherichia coli (negative control), listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus (both food-borne pathogens), listeria innocua, bacillus subtilis, carnobacterium maltaromaticum, lactobacillus plantarum or pediococcus acidilactici (all nonpathogenic bacteria). listeria monocytogenes and s. aureus killed the host rapidly compared with the negative control. infection with l. innocua, b. subtilis or c. maltaromaticum also resulted in a high fly mortality,  whereas lact. plantarum and p. acidilactici resulted in a slightly increased mortality. four additional d. melanogaster lines, three of which had been selected for heat, cold and desiccation resistance respectively, were subjected to infection by l. monocytogenes, s. aureus and e. coli. mortality rates were comparable with that of the oregon r strain. conclusions: use of the injection method shows the limitation of d. melanogaster as a model host for gram-positive  bacteria as opportunistic infection by nonpathogenic gram-positive bacteria results in partial or high mortality. in addition, lines of fruit flies resistant to various stress exposures did not show an increased resistance to infection by  gram-positive pathogens under the conditions tested. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the inadequacy of d. melanogaster infected by  the injection method in order to distinguish between virulent and nonvirulent gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of long-chain, water-soluble, dendritic tricarboxylato amphiphiles.
AB  == objectives: to measure the antimicrobial activities of three series of homologous, dendritic tricarboxylato (three-headed) amphiphiles against a battery of bacteria and fungi. methods: three series of homologous dendritic amphiphiles  were synthesized containing c13 to c22 fatty chains. susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus plantarum, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), mycobacterium smegmatis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans and aspergillus niger to the amphiphiles was measured by broth microdilution and reported as the mic. results: several amphiphiles from each homologous series, designed and constructed to overcome the low solubility of saturated long-chain fatty acids, had antimicrobial activity against mrsa (mic =  36 mg/l), c. albicans (mic = 4.4 mg/l), s. cerevisiae (mic = 1.1 mg/l) and m. smegmatis (mic = 8.9 mg/l). these amphiphiles had considerably better antimicrobial activities than the corresponding saturated fatty acids. alkyl chain length influenced the values of mic; longer chains (c18-c22) were generally more antimicrobial, but there was no uniform pattern among the microorganisms tested. conclusions: as the antimicrobial activity of the amphiphiles increased with increasing chain length, it is anticipated that maximum activity was not reached with these series. thus, the identification of the optimal chain length would provide a target compound for development of low-cost, topical microbicides and anti-infectives. further, these series of dendritic amphiphiles with the very long chains can be used as new water-soluble probes for elucidation of membrane structure and for identification of novel targets for antimicrobial design.

TI  == the effect of calcium ions on adhesion and competitive exclusion of lactobacillus ssp. and e. coli o138.
AB  == the adhesion abilities of 11 strains of lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the ipec-j2 cell line as a model system. bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri atcc 55730, l. johnsonii ncc 533 and l. reuteri dsm 12246, and new isolates of lactobacillus ssp. adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. the highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for l. reuteri dsm 12246 followed by l. plantarum q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. competitive adhesion experiments on ipec-j2 cells demonstrated  that strongly adhesive strains, as l. reuteri dsm 12246 and l. plantarum q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii ncc 533, both under condition of co-incubation and  in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to ipec-j2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally  weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. in contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of mg and zn ions. displacement assays performed with pathogenic e. coli o138 showed that all tested lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of e. coli o138 to ipec-j2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. the strains of  lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of e. coli o138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of e. coli o138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.

TI  == the 1',4'-iminopyrimidine tautomer of thiamin diphosphate is poised for catalysis in asymmetric active centers on enzymes.
AB  == thiamin diphosphate, a key coenzyme in sugar metabolism, is comprised of the thiazolium and 4'-aminopyrimidine aromatic rings, but only recently has participation of the 4'-aminopyrimidine moiety in catalysis gained wider acceptance. we report the use of electronic spectroscopy to identify the various  tautomeric forms of the 4'-aminopyrimidine ring on four thiamin diphosphate enzymes, all of which decarboxylate pyruvate: the e1 component of human pyruvate  dehydrogenase complex, the e1 subunit of escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase  complex, yeast pyruvate decarboxylase, and pyruvate oxidase from lactobacillus plantarum. it is shown that, according to circular dichroism spectroscopy, both the 1',4'-iminopyrimidine and the 4'-aminopyrimidine tautomers coexist on the e1  component of human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and pyruvate oxidase. because both tautomers are seen simultaneously, these two enzymes provide excellent evidence for nonidentical active centers (asymmetry) in solution in these multimeric enzymes. asymmetry of active centers can also be induced upon addition of acetylphosphinate, an excellent electrostatic pyruvate mimic, which participates in an enzyme-catalyzed addition to form a stable adduct, resembling  the common predecarboxylation thiamin-bound intermediate, which exists in its 1',4'-iminopyrimidine form. the identification of the 1',4'-iminopyrimidine tautomer on four enzymes is almost certainly applicable to all thiamin diphosphate enzymes: this tautomer is the intramolecular trigger to generate the  reactive ylide/carbene at the thiazolium c2 position in the first fundamental step of thiamin catalysis.

TI  == analysis of growth of lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 on a complex medium using a genome-scale metabolic model.
AB  == a genome-scale metabolic model of the lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 was constructed based on genomic content and experimental data. the complete model includes 721 genes, 643 reactions, and 531 metabolites. different stoichiometric modeling techniques were used for interpretation of complex fermentation data, as l. plantarum is adapted to nutrient-rich environments and only grows in media supplemented with vitamins and amino acids.  (i) based on experimental input and output fluxes, maximal atp production was estimated and related to growth rate. (ii) optimization of atp production further identified amino acid catabolic pathways that were not previously associated with free-energy metabolism. (iii) genome-scale elementary flux mode analysis identified 28 potential futile cycles. (iv) flux variability analysis supplemented the elementary mode analysis in identifying parallel pathways, e.g.  pathways with identical end products but different co-factor usage. strongly increased flexibility in the metabolic network was observed when strict coupling  between catabolic atp production and anabolic consumption was relaxed. these results illustrate how a genome-scale metabolic model and associated constraint-based modeling techniques can be used to analyze the physiology of growth on a complex medium rather than a minimal salts medium. however, optimization of biomass formation using the flux balance analysis approach, reported to successfully predict growth rate and by product formation in escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae, predicted too high biomass yields  that were incompatible with the observed lactate production. the reason is that this approach assumes optimal efficiency of substrate to biomass conversion, and  can therefore not predict the metabolically inefficient lactate formation.

AB  == the presence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(m) in human clinical  isolates of escherichia coli is described for the first time in this report. the  homologue was >99% identical to the tet(m) genes reported to occur in lactobacillus plantarum, neisseria meningitidis, and streptococcus agalactiae, and 3% of the residues in its deduced amino acid sequence diverge from tet(m) of  staphylococcus aureus. sequence analysis of the regions immediately flanking the  gene revealed that sequences upstream of tet(m) in e. coli have homology to tn916; however, a complete is26 insertion element was present immediately upstream of the promoter element. downstream from the termination codon is an insertion sequence that was homologous to the isvs1 element reported to occur in  a plasmid from vibrio salmonicida that has been associated with another tetracycline resistance determinant, tet(e). results of mating experiments demonstrated that the e. coli tet(m) gene was on a mobile element so that resistance to tetracycline and minocycline could be transferred to a susceptible  strain by conjugation. expression of the cloned tet(m) gene, under the control of its own promoter, provided tetracycline and minocycline resistance to the e. coli host.

TI  == characterization of the ap endonucleases from thermoplasma volcanium and lactobacillus plantarum: contributions of two important tryptophan residues to ap site recognition.
AB  == escherichia coli ap endonuclease (exoiii) and its human homolog (ape1) have the sole tryptophan residue for ap site recognition (ap site recognizer) but these residues are at different positions near the catalytic sites. on the other hand,  many bacterial ap endonucleases have two tryptophan residues at the same positions of both exoiii and ape1. to elucidate whether these residues are involved in ap site recognition, the exoiii homologs of thermoplasma volcanium and lactobacillus plantarum were characterized. these proteins showed ap endonuclease and 3'-5'exonculease activities. in each enzyme, the mutations of the tryptophan residues corresponding to trp-280 of ape1 caused more significant  reductions in activities and binding abilities to the oligonucleotide containing  an ap site (ap-dna) than those corresponding to trp-212 of exoiii. these results  suggest that the tryptophan residue corresponding to trp-280 of ape1 is the predominant ap site recognizer, and that corresponding to trp-212 of exoiii is the auxiliary recognizer.

TI  == a simple method to generate chromosomal mutations in lactobacillus plantarum strain tf103 to eliminate undesired fermentation products.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria have been explored to convert lignocellulosic biomass to biofuel and bioproducts. our long-term goal is to create genetically engineered lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains that convert agricultural biomass into ethanol and other value-added products. the immediate approaches toward this goal involve genetic manipulations by either introducing ethanol production pathway genes or inactivating pathways genes that lead to production of undesired byproducts. the  widely studied species lactobacillus plantarum is now considered a model for genetic manipulations of lab. in this study, l. plantarum tf103 strain, in which  two of the chromosomal l-ldh and d-ldh genes are inactivated, was used to introduce additional mutations on the chromosome to eliminate undesired fermentation products. we targeted the acetolactate synthase gene (als) that converts pyruvate to acetolactate, to eliminate the production of acetoin and 2,3-butanodial. a pbluescript derivative containing sections of the als coding region and an erythromycin resistance gene was directly introduced into l. plantarum tf103 cells to create mutations under selection pressure. the resulting erythromycin resistant (emr) tf103 strain appears to have chromosomal mutations of both the als and the adjacent lysp genes as revealed by polymerase chain reaction and southern blot analyses. mutations were thus generated via targeted homologous recombination using a gram-negative cloning vector, eliminating the use of a shuttle vector. this method should facilitate research in targeted inactivation of other genes in lab.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  == thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and  bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l.  reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a  strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.

TI  == isolation of bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from burkina faso.
AB  == a collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from burkina faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of bacillus cereus, bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. the six selected strains were identified as lactobacillus plantarum by 16s rdna sequencing, species-specific pcr and multiplex pcr of the reca gene. pcr amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in l. plantarum c11. among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from  this cluster.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == environmental stress response in wine lactic acid bacteria: beyond bacillus subtilis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) constitute a heterogeneous group of bacteria that are  traditionally used to produce fermented foods. the industrialization of food transformations has increased the economical importance of lab, as they play a crucial role in the development of the organoleptic and hygienic quality of fermented products. however, the strains selected for industrial purposes, should tolerate adverse conditions encountered in industrial processes, either during starter handling and storage (freeze-drying, freezing, or spray-drying) or during food processing in which abiotic stresses such as heat, cold, acidity, and high concentration of nacl or ethanol are common. wine lab have to deal with several stresses including an acidic ph, a high alcoholic content, non optimal growth temperatures, and growth-inhibitory compounds such as fatty acids and tannins, originated from yeast and bacteria metabolism. wine lab have developed several mechanisms to escape or to tolerate wine conditions. they carry out a malolactic  fermentation in this stressful environment. in addition to the regulation of the  expression of specific genes, bacteria have evolved adaptive networks to face the challenges of a changing environment and to survive under conditions of stress. the so called global regulatory systems control the simultaneous expression of a  large number of genes in response to a variety of environmental stress factors. circe sequences able to bind the hrca repressor, sigma(b) dependent promoters and ctsr regulatory elements have been observed in several genes identified from wine lab. improved knowledge of regulators and a better understanding of lab stress responses could constitute a basis of comparison with the well known model microorganisms, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. moreover, it can provide  an important insight into improving current industrial starter strains.

TI  == accelerating the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks.
AB  == background: the genomic information of a species allows for the genome-scale reconstruction of its metabolic capacity. such a metabolic reconstruction gives support to metabolic engineering, but also to integrative bioinformatics and visualization. sequence-based automatic reconstructions require extensive manual  curation, which can be very time-consuming. therefore, we present a method to accelerate the time-consuming process of network reconstruction for a query species. the method exploits the availability of well-curated metabolic networks  and uses high-resolution predictions of gene equivalency between species, allowing the transfer of gene-reaction associations from curated networks. results: we have evaluated the method using lactococcus lactis il1403, for which  a genome-scale metabolic network was published recently. we recovered most of the gene-reaction associations (i.e. 74 - 85%) which are incorporated in the published network. moreover, we predicted over 200 additional genes to be associated to reactions, including genes with unknown function, genes for transporters and genes with specific metabolic reactions, which are good candidates for an extension to the previously published network. in a comparison  of our developed method with the well-established approach pathologic, we predicted 186 additional genes to be associated to reactions. we also predicted a relatively high number of complete conserved protein complexes, which are derived from curated metabolic networks, illustrating the potential predictive power of our method for protein complexes. conclusion: we show that our methodology can be applied to accelerate the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks by taking optimal advantage of existing, manually curated networks. as orthology detection is the first step in the method, only the translated open reading frames (orfs) of a newly sequenced genome are necessary to reconstruct a metabolic network. when more manually curated metabolic networks will become available in the near future, the usefulness of our method in network prediction  is likely to increase.

TI  == improved expression and purification of the correctly folded response regulator plnc from lactobacilli.
AB  == the response regulator plnc is part of the signal transduction system that plays  a key role in the regulation of bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum c11. in this study, we wanted to express high levels of the response regulator plnc in a soluble and native form for purification and further studies. the protein was expressed as a fusion protein (fplnc) containing an n-terminal flag-tag to facilitate detection and purification. when the fusion gene, fplnc, was expressed in escherichia coli bl21, nearly all (99%) of the recombinant protein ended up inside inclusion bodies as an incorrectly folded protein. by utilizing two different gram-positive expression systems (sip and nice) in l. plantarum nc8 and lactobacillus sakei lb790, the expression of the soluble fplnc  was significantly increased, being 20-40 times more than that in e. coli bl21. using the n-terminal tag, the expressed protein was purified by immunoprecipitation. by dna-binding study (emsa), we demonstrated that the fusion protein purified from the soluble pool was correctly folded as judged by its ability to bind specifically on regulated promoters. using our approach, we estimate that about 1 mg of fplnc can be purified from 11 of the bacterial culture.

TI  == antagonistic activity of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria against entero- and uropathogens.
AB  == aim: to develop in vitro assays for comparing the antagonistic properties and anti-oxidative activity of probiotic lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains against various entero- and urinary pathogens. methods and results: the antagonistic activity of five probiotic lactobacilli (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus fermentum me-3, lactobacillus acidophilus la5, lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2) and two bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium lactis bb12, bifidobacterium longum 46) against six target pathogens was estimated using different assays (solid and liquid media, anaerobic and microaerobic cultivation) and ranked (low, intermediate and high). bacterial  fermentation products were determined by gas chromatography, and the total anti-oxidative activity of probiotics was measured using linolenic acid test. pyelonephritic escherichia coli was highly suppressed by gg and both bifidobacteria strains. lactobacilli strains 8700:2, 299v and me-3 were the most  effective against salmonella enterica ssp. enterica in microaerobic while me-3 and both bifidobacteria expressed high activity against shigella sonnei in anaerobic milieu. lact. paracasei, lact. rhamnosus and lact. plantarum strains showed intermediate antagonistic activity against helicobacter pylori under microaerobic conditions on solid media. the highest anti-oxidative activity was characteristic for lact. fermentum me-3 (p < 0.05). no efficient antagonist against clostridium difficile was found. the positive correlations between the ph, lactic acid production and anti-microbial activity for all tested probiotics  were assessed. conclusions: developed experimental assays enable to compare the anti-microbial and -oxidative activity of lactobacillus and/or bifidobacterium probiotics, which have been claimed to possess the ability of suppressing the growth of various enteric and urinary pathogens. significance and impact of the study: screening lactobacillus and bifidobacterium sp. strains according to their activity in various environmental conditions could precede the clinical efficacy  studies for adjunct treatment with probiotics in cure of different gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections.

TI  == regulation of aspartokinase, aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, dihydrodipicolinate synthase and dihydrodipicolinate reductase in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == the use of a lysine-overproducing strain of lactobacillus plantarum in food or feed fermentations may lead to the production of lysine-rich products. the availability of functional genes and information on the regulation of lysine biosynthesis are required to develop a lysine-overproducing strain. the genome sequence of l. plantarum revealed putative lysine biosynthetic genes, some of which may produce isozymes. this study examined the functionality of the genes and the regulation of the first four enzymes of lysine biosynthesis, together with homoserine dehydrogenase, in l. plantarum. the genes were expressed in escherichia coli, and the regulation of the enzymes was studied in cell extracts  of both recombinant e. coli and l. plantarum. among seven lysine biosynthetic genes studied (aspartokinase genes, thra1 and thra2; aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase genes, asd1 and asd2; dihydrodipicolinate synthase genes, dapa1 and dapa2; and the dihydrodipicolinate reductase gene, dapb) plus two homoserine dehydrogenase genes (hom1 and hom2), the products of six genes, i.e. thra2, asd2, dapa1, dapb, hom1 and hom2, showed obvious enzyme activities in vitro. the product of one of the homoserine dehydrogenase genes, hom1, exhibited both homoserine dehydrogenase and aspartokinase activities. however, the aspartokinase activity was mainly due to thra2 and was inhibited by l-lysine and repressed by l-threonine, and the homoserine dehydrogenase activity was mainly due to hom2 and was inhibited by l-threonine. the aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, dihydrodipicolinate synthase and dihydrodipicolinate reductase were not regulated by the end-products of the pathway.

AB  == recombinant escherichia coli jm109 (pzh3-5/pmt), harboring a manganese transport  gene (mnta) and a metal-sequestering protein (metallothionein [mt]) gene, was cultivated to accumulate cadmium (cd) in an aqueous phase. isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside (iptg)-induced cells showed rapid cd(2+) ion accumulation  (90% of maximum accumulation in 15 min) and had an accumulation six times higher  than that of the control. under optimum conditions, i.e., ph 7, 37 degrees c and  0.5 (od600), 1.5 mm iptg induction resulted in the accumulation of 21.5 micromol  cd/g dry cell. storage at 37 degrees c for 24 h had no effect on the accumulation. significantly, cd was selectively accumulated in a solution containing an equal concentration of three other metals, resulting in more than 90% of the total accumulated metals being cd. the accumulation of cd was reduced  by the presence of mn2+ ion whereas no significant effect was observed with cu2+, zn2+ and pb2+ ions. a chelator, edta, had no effect on the accumulation up to 100 mm. the bioaccumulation rate followed michaelis-menten kinetics (vm=2.7 micromol  cd2+/min.g dry cell, km=0.67 microm). the equilibrium isotherm showed a langmuir  isotherm. in the membrane reactor experiment, 1 mg/l cd in an inlet solution decreased to 0.2 mg/l in the effluent, removing 80% of cd, continuously. these results indicated the potentials of a genetically modified microorganism for the  highly selective accumulation of cd at a low concentration and the future application to the removal and recovery of cd.

AB  == to develop systems for the expression of heterologous genes in probiotic strains  of lactobacillus and propionibacterium, we used lactobacillus plantarum and propionibacterium freudenreichii and a modified gene encoding cholesterol oxidase (choa) from streptomyces sp. to generate working models. the acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase (acc) promoter derived from the acc operon of l. plantarum l137 and a previously constructed shuttle vector, prn14, were used to construct vectors for  the expression of heterologous genes in lactic acid bacteria. the concentration of cholesterol oxidase in recombinant l. plantarum carrying choa fused to the nh2-terminal region of the first open reading frame of the acc operon was 3.6 mu/mg of protein. using the promoters from propionibacterium, namely, p4, p8, and p138, which enabled high-level expression of choa in escherichia coli, and a previously constructed shuttle vector ppk705, we constructed expression vectors for propionibacterium. in recombinant p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii ifo12426, the activities of cholesterol oxidase generated under the control of promoters p4, p8, and p138 were 1.6, 4.3, and 7.2 u/mg of protein, respectively.  the expression of heterologous genes may facilitate the production of useful proteins in these economically important bacteria.

TI  == cloning, expression, purification, and analysis of mannitol dehydrogenase gene mtlk from lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == the commercial production of mannitol involves high-pressure hydrogenation of fructose using a nickel catalyst, a costly process. mannitol can be produced through fermentation by microorganisms. currently, a few lactobacillus strains are used to develop an efficient process for mannitol bioproduction; most of the  strains produce mannitol from fructose with other products. an approach toward improving this process would be to genetically engineer lactobacillus strains to  increase fructose-to-mannitol conversion with decreased production of other products. we cloned the gene mtlk encoding mannitol-2-dehydrogenase (ec 1.1.1.67) that catalyzes the conversion of fructose into mannitol from lactobacillus brevis using genomic polymerase chain reaction. the mtlk clone contains 1328 bp of dna sequence including a 1002-bp open reading frame that consisted of 333 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of about 36 kda. the functional mannitol-2-dehydrogenase was produced by overexpressing mtlk via prseta vector in escherichia coli bl21plyss on isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction. the fusion protein is able to catalyze the reduction of fructose to mannitol at ph 5.35. similar rates of catalytic reduction were observed using either the nadh or nadph as cofactor under in vitro assay conditions. genetically engineered lactobacillus plantarum tf103 carrying the mtlk gene of l. brevis indicated increased mannitol production from glucose. the evaluation of mixed sugar fermentation and mannitol production by this strain is in progress.

TI  == transformation of lactobacillus plantarum by electroporation with in vitro modified plasmid dna.
AB  == an improved method for the electrotransformation of lactobacillus plantarum cect  220 (atcc 8014) with plasmid dna isolated from escherichia coli is described. the two main modifications with respect to existing methods are: (i) isolation of plasmid dna from e. coli jm110 grown in minimal medium and (ii) in vitro modification of the dna by cell-free extracts of the host l. plantarum. optimal electrotransformation was obtained with exponentially growing cells of l. plantarum concentrated to 6x10(9) cfu ml-1, with electric pulses of 13 kv cm-1 in cuvettes with 1 mm inter-electrode distance. we consider that this method constitutes a useful tool for routine manipulation of l. plantarum, and can probably be extended to other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == [quantitative characterization of antagonistic activity of lactobacilli].
AB  == in this work the method of serial dilutions of lactobacilli in two-layer agar was used. on the agar surface bacterial or fungal cultures were applied at different  time intervals. a special quantitative characteristic was introduced. l. plantarum strain 8p-a3 was shown to have the maximum antagonistic activity. in great amounts l. casei and l. reuteri are capable to suppress the growth of bacteria and fungi. all lactobacilli under study produced a pronounced bactericidal effect on pseudomonas, had different influence on the viability of escherichia and staphylococci and exhibited fungistatic and fungicidal action only when inoculated at high concentrations.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == optimization of bacteriocin production by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, a strain isolated from barley beer.
AB  == the cell-free supernatant containing bacteriocin st13br, produced by lactobacillus plantarum st13br, inhibits the growth of l. casei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli. based on tricine-sds-page, bacteriocin st13br is 10 kda in size. complete inactivation or significant reduction in bacteriocin activity was observed after  treatment with proteinase k, trypsin and pronase, but not with catalase or alpha-amylase. low bacteriocin activity (200 au/ml) was recorded in bhi medium, m17 broth, 10% (w/v) soy milk, and 2% and 10% (w/v) molasses, despite good growth. maximal bacteriocin activity (6,400 au/ml) was recorded after 23 h in mrs broth, but only at 30 degrees c. tween 80 in mrs broth increased bacteriocin production by more than 50%. meat extract or yeast extract as sole nitrogen source, or a combination of the two (1 : 1) in mrs broth, stimulated bacteriocin  production (6,400 au/ml). only 50% activity (3,200 au/ml) was recorded with tryptone as sole nitrogen source, whereas a combination of tryptone, meat extract and yeast extract yielded 6,400 au/ml. bacteriocin production was not stimulated  by the addition of glucose at 2.0% w/v (3,200 au/ml), nor 2% (w/v) fructose, sucrose, lactose or mannose, respectively (800 au/ml). activity levels less than  200 au/ml were recorded in the presence of 0.05% to 0.5% (w/v) maltose. maximal bacteriocin production (6,400 au/ml) was recorded in the presence of 2% (w/v) maltose. maltose at 4.0% (w/v) led to a 50% reduction of bacteriocin activity. the presence of 1.0% (w/v) and higher kh(2)po(4), or glycerol at 0.2% (w/v) suppressed bacteriocin production.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == two arginine repressors regulate arginine biosynthesis in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == the repression of the carab operon encoding carbamoyl phosphate synthase leads to lactobacillus plantarum fb331 growth inhibition in the presence of arginine. this phenotype was used in a positive screening to select spontaneous mutants deregulated in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. fourteen mutants were genetically characterized for constitutive arginine production. mutations were located either in one of the arginine repressor genes (argr1 or argr2) present in l. plantarum or in a putative arg operator in the intergenic region of the bipolar carab-argcjbdf operons involved in arginine biosynthesis. although the presence of two argr regulators is commonly found in gram-positive bacteria, only single arginine repressors have so far been well studied in escherichia coli or bacillus subtilis. in l. plantarum, arginine repression was abolished when argr1  or argr2 was mutated in the dna binding domain, or in the oligomerization domain  or when an a123d mutation occurred in argr1. a123, equivalent to the conserved residue a124 in e. coli argr involved in arginine binding, was different in the wild-type argr2. thus, corepressor binding sites may be different in argr1 and argr2, which have only 35% identical residues. other mutants harbored wild-type argr genes, and 20 mutants have lost their ability to grow in normal air without  carbon dioxide enrichment; this revealed a link between arginine biosynthesis and a still-unknown co2-dependent metabolic pathway. in many gram-positive bacteria,  the expression and interaction of different argr-like proteins may imply a complex regulatory network in response to environmental stimuli.

AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == high-level gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum using a pheromone-regulated bacteriocin promoter.
AB  == aims: to use promoters and regulatory genes involved in the production of the bacteriocin sakacin p to obtain high-level regulated gene expression in lactobacillus plantarum. methods and results: in a plasmid containing all three operons naturally involved in sakacin p production, the genes encoding sakacin p  and its immunity protein were replaced by the aminopeptidase n gene from lactococcus lactis (pepn) or the beta-glucuronidase gene from escherichia coli (gusa). the new genes were precisely fused to the start codon of the sakacin p gene and the stop codon of the immunity gene. this set-up permitted regulated (external pheromone controlled) overexpression of both reporter genes in l. plantarum nc8. for pepn, production levels amounted to as much as 40% of total cellular protein. conclusions: promoters and regulatory genes involved in production of sakacin p are suitable for establishing inducible high-level gene expression in l. plantarum. significance and impact of the study: this study describes a system for controllable gene expression in lactobacilli, giving some  of the highest expression levels reported so far in this genus.

TI  == mode of antimicrobial action of vanillin against escherichia coli, lactobacillus  plantarum and listeria innocua.
AB  == aims: to investigate the mode of action of vanillin, the principle flavour component of vanilla, with regard to its antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum and listeria innocua. methods and results: in laboratory media, mics of 15, 75 and 35 mmol l(-1) vanillin were established for e. coli, lact. plantarum and l. innocua, respectively. the observed inhibition was found to be bacteriostatic. exposure to 10-40 mmol l(-1)  vanillin inhibited respiration of e. coli and l. innocua. addition of 50-70 mmol  l(-1) vanillin to bacterial cell suspensions of the three organisms led to an increase in the uptake of the nucleic acid stain propidium iodide; however a significant proportion of cells still remained unstained indicating their cytoplasmic membranes were largely intact. exposure to 50 mmol l(-1) vanillin completely dissipated potassium ion gradients in cultures of lact. plantarum within 40 min, while partial potassium gradients remained in cultures of e. coli  and l. innocua. furthermore, the addition of 100 mmol l(-1) vanillin to cultures  of lact. plantarum resulted in the loss of ph homeostasis. however, intracellular atp pools were largely unaffected in e. coli and l. innocua cultures upon exposure to 50 mmol l(-1) vanillin, while atp production was stimulated in lact.  plantarum cultures. in contrast to the more potent activity of carvacrol, a well  studied phenolic flavour compound, the extent of membrane damage caused by vanillin is less severe. conclusions: vanillin is primarily a membrane-active compound, resulting in the dissipation of ion gradients and the inhibition of respiration, the extent to which is species-specific. these effects initially do  not halt the production of atp. significance and impact of the study: understanding the mode of action of natural antimicrobials may facilitate their application as natural food preservatives, particularly for their potential use in preservation systems employing multiple hurdles.

TI  == characterization and comparison of metal accumulation in two escherichia coli strains expressing either copa or mnta, heavy metal-transporting bacterial p-type adenosine triphosphatases.
AB  == mnta from lactobacillus plantarum and copa from enterococcus hirae both encode membrane proteins that are members of the p-type family of adenosine triphosphatases (atpases). both transporters act as metal importers to take up nutritionally required substrates; mnta translocates mn(ii) and copa translocates cu(i). both atpases can also translocate secondary substrates, cd(ii) and ag(i),  respectively. although functionally and sequentially similar, these atpases differ in several key residues and in their membrane topologies. the bioaccumulation properties of these two proteins were examined by coexpressing the transporters with overexpressed metallothionein in escherichia coli cells, a  system that has previously shown high levels of substrate-specific uptake. both strains exhibited rapid metal accumulation, both saturated at around 50 microm metal, and both displayed temperature-sensitive uptake. however, the transporters responded differently when external conditions were varied; mnta displayed increased sensitivity to ionic strength, while copa was more ph sensitive and more inhibited by chelating agents. the differences in accumulation are likely owing to structural differences in the transmembrane region of these two atpases.

TI  == commensal gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced il-23 and il-27 expression and enhanced th1 development.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

TI  == pattern of cytokine responses to gram-positive and gram-negative commensal bacteria is profoundly changed when monocytes differentiate into dendritic cells.
AB  == the normal gastrointestinal bacterial flora is crucial for the maturation of acquired immunity via effects on antigen-presenting cells (apcs). here we investigated how two types of apcs, monocytes and dendritic cells (dcs), react to different bacterial strains typical of the commensal intestinal microflora. purified human monocytes and monocyte-derived dcs were stimulated with uv-inactivated gram-positive (lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium adolescentis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and veillonella parvula) bacterial strains. monocytes produced higher levels of interleukin 12p70 (il-12p70) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf), as detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in response to l. plantarum than in response to e. coli and  v. parvula. in contrast, dcs secreted large amounts of il-12p70, tnf, il-6, and il-10 in response to e. coli and v. parvula but were practically unresponsive to  l. plantarum and b. adolescentis. the lack of a response to the gram-positive strains correlated with lower surface expression of toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) on dcs than on monocytes. the surface expression of tlr4 on dcs was undetectable  when it was analyzed by flow cytometry, but blocking this receptor decreased the  tnf production in response to v. parvula, indicating that tlr4 is expressed at a  low density on dcs. gamma interferon increased the expression of tlr4 on dcs and  also potentiated the cytokine response to the gram-negative strains. our results  indicate that when monocytes differentiate into dcs, their ability to respond to  different commensal bacteria dramatically changes, and they become unresponsive to probiotic gram-positive bacteria. these results may have important implications for the abilities of different groups of commensal bacteria to regulate mucosal and systemic immunity.

TI  == cloning, deletion, and characterization of padr, the transcriptional repressor of the phenolic acid decarboxylase-encoding pada gene of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum displays a substrate-inducible pada gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase enzyme (pada) that is considered a specific chemical  stress response to the inducing substrate. the putative regulator of pada was located in the pada locus based on its 52% identity with padr, the pada gene transcriptional regulator of pediococcus pentosaceus (l. barthelmebs, b. lecomte, c. divies, and j.-f. cavin, j. bacteriol. 182:6724-6731, 2000). deletion of the l. plantarum padr gene clearly demonstrates that the protein it encodes is the transcriptional repressor of divergently oriented pada. the padr gene is cotranscribed with a downstream open reading frame (orf1), the product of which may belong to a group of universal stress proteins (usp). the padr deletion mutant overexpressed pada constitutively, and the pada promoter appears to be tightly regulated in this bacterium. gel mobility shift assays using the pada gene promoter region and purified padr expressed in escherichia coli indicated that operator dna binding by padr was not eliminated by addition of p-coumarate.  gel mobility shift assays using partially purified extracts of native padr protein from both phenolic acid-induced and noninduced l. plantarum cells demonstrate that inactivation of padr by phenolic acids requires the integrity of l. plantarum and mediation by a specific protein absent in e. coli.

AB  == this work studied the viabilities of five types of cells (two yeast cells, saccharomyces cerevisiae cbs 1171 and candida utilis; two bacterial strains, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum; and one human leukemia k562 cell) as a function of cooling rate during freezing. the range of investigated cooling  rates extended from 5 to 30,000 degrees c/min. cell viability was classified into three ranges: (i) high viability for low cooling rates (5 to 180 degrees c/min),  which allow cell water outflow to occur completely and do not allow any intracellular crystallization; (ii) low viability for rapid cooling rates (180 to 5,000 degrees c/min), which allow the heat flow to prevail over water outflow (in this case, cell water crystallization would occur as water was flowing out of the cell); (iii) high viability for very high cooling rates (>5,000 degrees c/min), which allow the heat flow to be very rapid and induce intracellular crystallization and/or vitrification before any water outflow from the cell. finally, an assumption relating cell death to the cell water crystallization as water is flowing out of the cell is made. in addition, this general cell behavior is different for each type of cell and seems to be moderated by the cell size, the water permeability properties, and the presence of a cell wall.

AB  == aims: the aim of this paper was to study if homofermentative strains (lacobacillus plantarum) capable of malolactic fermentation in wine can degrade arginine via the adi pathway. methods and results: homofermentative lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from a typical red wine were investigated for their ability to produce citrulline. citrulline was formed suggesting that the arginine metabolism takes place via the arginine deiminase (adi) pathway and not via the arginase/urease pathway. ammonia was also detected with nessler's reagent, and all the strains examined were able to produce ammonia. identification of homofermentative lab was performed using 16s ribosomal sequence analysis. the strains were further classified as belonging to l. plantarum species. furthermore, the genes encoding for the three pathway enzymes (adi, ornithine transcarbamylase, carbamate kinase) were partially cloned and gene expression was performed at two different ph values (3.6 and 4.5). conclusions: the results suggest that citrulline production in wine, could be performed by homofermentative lab. significance and impact of the study: homofermentative malolactic bacteria (l. plantarum) may degrade arginine through the adi pathway.

TI  == structural analysis of the peptide pheromone receptor plnb, a histidine protein kinase from lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == intercellular communication plays a key role in the regulation of several physiological processes in gram-positive bacteria. cell-cell communication is often mediated by secreted inducer peptide pheromones (ips), which upon reaching  a threshold concentration in the environment specifically activate a cognate membrane-localized histidine protein kinase (hpk). interestingly, the majority of ip-activated hpks fall into one distinct subfamily (hpk(10)). as part of an effort to study the mechanism underlying pheromone-mediated activation of the hpk(10) subfamily, the present work investigated the membrane topology of plnb from lactobacillus plantarum. gene fusion experiments with escherichia coli and lactobacillus sakei, using alkaline phosphatase, beta-lactamase, and beta-galactosidase reporter fusions, suggested that plnb is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane via seven transmembrane segments. by domain switching between hpk(10) members, it was demonstrated that the determinants for pheromone  binding and specificity are contained within the transmembrane domain. the results also indicate that the mechanism of signal transduction, in which the final transmembrane segment apparently plays a key role, is conserved between members of the hpk(10) subfamily.

TI  == antimicrobial interactions of microbial species involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima with particular reference to the inhibitory effect of lactic acid bacteria on enteric pathogens.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria, bacillus species and yeasts are involved in the fermentation of cassava dough into agbelima. microbial interactions within and between these groups of microorganisms were investigated in addition to the survival of five enteric pathogens inoculated into agbelima under various conditions. nine out of 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the end of agbelima fermentation showed inhibitory effect against 10 cultures of lactic acid bacteria isolated at the start of fermentation. only 3 out of 10 isolates of bacillus subtilis were inhibited by 10 isolates of lactic acid bacteria tested. no interactions were observed between yeasts and the lactic acid bacteria, whereas three of the bacillus isolates showed inhibitory effects against the yeasts. twelve isolates of lactobacillus plantarum tested inhibited the growth of an isolate each of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus brevis but none tested positive for bacteriocin production. the antimicrobial effect of the lactic acid bacteria was attributed to acid production. in fermenting cassava dough, enteric pathogens survived to different extents depending on ph and their  sensitivity to acids. vibrio cholerae c-230, salmonella typhimurium 9 and salmonella enteritidis 226 were not detectable in 10 g of sample after 4 h when inoculated into the 48-h fermented product, agbelima, whereas shigella dysenteriae 2357t and escherichia coli d2188 were detectable up to 8 h in the product.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == characterization of a theta-type plasmid from lactobacillus sakei: a potential basis for low-copy-number vectors in lactobacilli.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the 13-kb plasmid prv500, isolated from lactobacillus sakei rv332, was determined. sequence analysis enabled the identification of genes coding for a putative type i restriction-modification system, two genes coding for putative recombinases of the integrase family, and a region likely involved in replication. the structural features of this region, comprising a putative ori segment containing 11- and 22-bp repeats and a repa gene coding for a putative initiator protein, indicated that prv500 belongs to the pucl287 subfamily of theta-type replicons. a 3.7-kb fragment encompassing this region was fused to an escherichia coli replicon to produce the shuttle vector prv566 and was observed to be functional in l. sakei for plasmid replication. the l. sakei replicon alone could not support replication in e. coli. plasmid prv500 and its derivative prv566 were determined to be at very low  copy numbers in l. sakei. prv566 was maintained at a reasonable rate over 20 generations in several lactobacilli, such as lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus plantarum, in addition to l. sakei, making it an interesting basis for developing vectors. sequence relationships with other plasmids are described and discussed.

TI  == the effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  == there are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. in this study, lactobacillus strains (l. rhamnosus, l. gasseri,  l. casei and l. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic  escherichia coli (ehec) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, c2bbe1.  while the adhesion and colonization of ehec was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of ehec into the cell line was  markedly suppressed by l. rhamnosus, though not by others. concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of ehec and host cell were not affected by the presence of l. rhamnosus. simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on ehec internalization was strictly dependent on viable l. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed l. rhamnosus. the fact that l. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between l. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of ehec.

AB  == this paper reports the complete nucleotide sequence of the 3.85 kbp plasmid pbm02 from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris p8-2-47. analysis of the sequence predicted six orfs larger than 25 amino acids. they all were transcribed from the same strand and organized in two functional cassettes: the replication region and a putative mobilization region. in the replication region, two orfs specifying proteins homologous to others found in some classes of rolling circle-replicating plasmids were encountered (copg and repb). in fact, single-stranded dna was detected as a replication intermediate of pbm02. copg and repb, together with some upstream sequences, formed part of the minimal replication unit of the plasmid. interestingly, pbm02 shared a 212 bp stretch with plasmids of the pwv01  type, in which the whole single-strand origin of replication is included. in the  mobilization region, an orf coding for a mobilization-like protein was present, preceded by a putative orit sequence homologous to that of plasmid pmv158. the replicon of pbm02 is of the wide-host range type, and functions in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum inhibits the intestinal epithelial migration of neutrophils induced by enteropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == background: lactobacillus plantarum is a gram-positive bacillus known for its effect as a probiotic agent. the goal of the study was to determine whether l. plantarum is capable of inhibiting the transepithelial neutrophil migration induced by enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec). methods: cultured intestinal epithelial t-84 cell monolayers were rapidly infected with epec. l. plantarum or  culture supernatants were added to the monolayers before and after the infection. indium-labeled neutrophils were added to the basolateral side of inverted monolayers. after 150-minute incubation, radioactivity of the neutrophils that migrated in the physiologic direction was assayed, and the number of migrating neutrophils was calculated. l. plantarum was also added to the monolayers before  and after epec infection, and the number of adherent epec was determined by plate counting. results: epec-induced neutrophil migration and epec binding to monolayers were inhibited by viable l. plantarum but only when added to the monolayers before epec. culture supernatants failed to inhibit the neutrophil migration. conclusions: these results suggest that l. plantarum is beneficial in  inhibiting neutrophil migration induced by epec, but only when preincubated with  host epithelia. rather than an indirect effect through a secreted substance produced by the probiotic agent, its effect is direct and requires the presence of the bacterium.

TI  == evolution of microbial populations during traditional feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  == in three different dairies (a, b and c) located in peloponess region (southern greece), traditional feta cheese trials took place february to march using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. the main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (nslab), presumptive leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. the remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. the yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and e. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. a number of 146 isolates (dairy a) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates  of related species lactobacillus pentosus and lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.

TI  == molecular analysis of the lysis protein lys encoded by lactobacillus plantarum phage phig1e.
AB  == the putative cell-lysis gene lys of lactobacillus plantarum g1e phage phig1e encodes for a 442 amino-acids protein lys. the n-terminal region (about 80 amino  acids) of lys consists of two discrete regions (the signal-peptide-like domain and the de domain containing putative active sites of endolysin). to elucidate functions of the regions of lys, mutational (random, site-directed, and/or fusion) analysis was performed. the plasmid pndehl, expressing the wild type lys  protein under promoter of lacz' gene in escherichia coli, was constructed. two molecular species (44 kda; referred to as pre-lys, and 42 kda; mature-lys) from the protein extract of xl1-blue/pndehl were detected on a sodium dodecyl sulfate  gel and zymogram with l. plantarum g1e cells. based on the n-terminal amino acid  sequences, the two molecules were determined as; pre-lys (the amino acid position deduced from lys gene, 1-7) mklknkl, mature-lys (27-33) qtlssqs. the mature lys was hardly detected in the cells treated with sodium azide. these results suggested that the n-terminal 26 amino acids region of lys precursor form is possibly processed posttranslationally, by a seca-dependent manner at least in e. coli. analysis of the point mutants (pld36a, ple39a, ple55a, ple67a and pld71a),  indicated that the acidic residues (aspartic acids at position 36, 71 and glutamic acids at position 39, 55) of n-terminal region and the serine at the position 48 of phig1e lys are essential for the lytic activity.

TI  == innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  == the hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. the aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus mitis, corynebacterium minutissimum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides vulgatus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, veillonella parvula, and neisseria sicca. the levels of interleukin 12 (il-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-10, and il-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the tnf-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking cd14, toll-like receptor 2 (tlr-2), and tlr-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. the levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of il-12 and tnf-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. the levels of il-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of  il-10 were similar in newborns and adults. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of il-6 and il-10 in cord cells. l. plantarum bound or signaled through cd14, tlr-2, and tlr-4, whereas e. coli acted mainly through cd14 and tlr-4. these results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.

TI  == characterization of the mela locus for alpha-galactosidase in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == alpha-galactosides are abundant sugars in legumes such as soy. because of the lack of alpha-galactosidase (alpha-gal) in the digestive tract, humans are unable to digest these sugars, which consequently induce flatulence. to develop the consumption of the otherwise highly nutritional soy products, the use of exogenous alpha-gal is promising. in this framework, we characterized the mela gene for alpha-gal in lactobacillus plantarum. the mela gene encodes a cytoplasmic 84-kda protein whose enzymatically active form occurs as oligomers. the mela gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, yielding an active alpha-gal. we show that mela is transcribed from its own promoter, yielding a monocistronic mrna, and that it is regulated at the transcriptional level, i.e.,  it is induced by melibiose but is not totally repressed by glucose. posttranscriptional regulation by the carbon source could also occur. upstream of mela, a putative galactoside transporter, designated rafp, was identified that shows high homology to lacs, the unique transporter for both alpha- and beta-galactosides in streptococcus thermophilus. rafp is also expressed as a monocistronic mrna. downstream of mela, the lacl and lacm genes were identified that encode a heterodimeric beta-galactosidase. a putative galm gene identified in the same cluster suggests the presence of a galactose operon. these results indicate that the genes involved in galactoside catabolism are clustered in l. plantarum atcc 8014. this first genetic characterization of mela and of its putative associated transporter, rafp, in a lactobacillus opens doors to various  applications both in the manufacture of soy-derived products and in probiotic and nutraceutical issues.

TI  == evaluation of the heat inactivation of escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum by differential scanning calorimetry.
AB  == differential scanning calorimetry (dsc) is used to evaluate the thermal stability and reversibility after heat treatment of transitions associated with various cellular components of escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum. the reversibility and the change in the thermal stability of individual transitions are evaluated by a second temperature scan after preheating in the dsc to various temperatures between 40 and 130 degrees c. the viability of bacteria after a heat treatment between 55 and 70 degrees c in the dsc is determined by both plate count and calorimetric data. the fractional viability values based on calorimetric and plate count data show a linear relationship. viability loss and  the irreversible change in dsc thermograms of pretreated whole cells are highly correlated between 55 and 70 degrees c. comparison of dsc scans for isolated ribosomes shows that the thermal stability of e. coli ribosomes is greater than that of l. plantarum ribosomes, consistent with the greater thermal tolerance of  e. coli observed from viability loss and dsc scans of whole cells.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum reduces the in vitro secretory response of intestinal epithelial cells to enteropathogenic escherichia coli infection.
AB  == objective: enteropathogenic (epec) is a gram-negative bacillus that causes diarrhea. secretory responses of intestinal epithelial cells can be seen after epec infection. probiotics, which are live bacteria that have proven benefit to the host, play a role in the treatment and prevention of the different enteric pathogens. the goals of the study were to determine whether the probiotic agent (lbp) strain 299v alters the secretory changes seen in epec infection and, if so, what underlying mechanism is possible. methods: caco-2 cell monolayers were rapidly infected with epec strain e2348/69 and immediately mounted in ussing chambers. the monolayers were exposed to lbp before, after, and simultaneously with epec infection. short circuit current (isc) was measured in the ussing chamber. results: epec infection caused an increase in short circuit current that was reduced by preincubation with lbp ( < 0.01). no direct bactericidal effect was observed, but lbp reduced the attachment of epec to caco-2 cells. conclusion: lbp can play an important role in reducing the secretory change in response to epec infection, possibly through inhibition of its binding. however, the presence of the probiotic agent before the infection is necessary. in this setting, its role is more preventive rather than therapeutic.

AB  == bacteria inhabit natural and artificial environments with diverse and fluctuating osmolalities, salinities and temperatures. many maintain cytoplasmic hydration, growth and survival most effectively by accumulating kosmotropic organic solutes  (compatible solutes) when medium osmolality is high or temperature is low (above  freezing). they release these solutes into their environment when the medium osmolality drops. solutes accumulate either by synthesis or by transport from the extracellular medium. responses to growth in high osmolality medium, including biosynthetic accumulation of trehalose, also protect salmonella typhimurium from  heat shock. osmotically regulated transporters and mechanosensitive channels modulate cytoplasmic solute levels in bacillus subtilis, corynebacterium glutamicum, escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. each organism harbours multiple osmoregulatory transporters with overlapping substrate specificities. membrane proteins that can act as both osmosensors and osmoregulatory transporters have been identified (secondary transporters prop of e. coli and betp of c. glutamicum as well as abc transporter opua of l. lactis). the molecular bases for the modulation of gene expression and transport activity by temperature and medium osmolality are under intensive investigation with emphasis on the role of the membrane as an antenna for osmo- and/or thermosensors.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum 299v inhibits escherichia coli-induced intestinal permeability.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to investigate whether a probiotic bacterium, lactobacillus plantarum 299v, could affect escherichia coli-induced passage of mannitol across the intestinal wall. sprague-dawley rats were pretreated for one  week by either tube feeding with l. plantarum 299v twice daily, free access to l. plantarum 299v by adding the bacterium in the drinking water, or negative control receiving regular feeding. intestinal segments were mounted in ussing chambers and the mucosa was exposed to control medium, e. coli, and l. plantarum 299v (alone or together). [14c]mannitol was added as a marker of intestinal permeability and samples were taken from the serosal side. e. coli exposure induced a 53% increase in mannitol passage across the intestinal wall (p < 0.05). one week of pretreatment with l. plantarum 299v in the drinking water abolished the e. coli-induced increase in permeability. tube feeding for one week or short-term addition of l. plantarum 299v in the ussing chambers had no effect on  the permeability provoked by e. coli challenge. notably, l. plantanum 299v itself did not change the intestinal passage of mannitol. these data demonstrate that pretreatment with l. plantarum 299v, which is a probiotic bacterium, protects against e. coli-induced increase in intestinal permeability, and that l. plantarum 299v alone has no influence on the intestinal permeability. thus, this  study supports the concept that probiotics may exert beneficial effects in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == typing and subtyping of 83 clinical isolates purified from surgically implanted silicone feeding tubes by random amplified polymorphic dna amplification.
AB  == in this study, 83 clinical isolates purified from biofilms colonizing 18 silicone gastrostomy devices (12 "buttons" and six tubes converted to skin level devices)  were selected for subtype characterization utilizing genetic analysis. the tubes, previously used for feeding, remained in place for 3 to 47 months (mean, 20.0 months) in children ranging in age from 6 months to 17 years. classification of specific microbes using random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis revealed genetic similarities and differences among isolates belonging to the same genus.  both gram-positive and -negative bacteria were investigated, including 2 isolates of bacillus brevis, 4 isolates of bacillus licheniformis, 2 isolates of bacillus  pumilus, 3 isolates of enterococcus durans, 19 isolates of enterococcus faecalis, 8 isolates of enterococcus faecium, 2 isolates of enterococcus hirae, 7 isolates  of escherichia coli, 8 isolates of lactobacillus plantarum, 19 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 2 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, and 7 isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus. amplified dna fragments (amplicons) provided species-specific fingerprints for comparison by agarose gel electrophoresis. a total of 62 distinct rapd types were categorized from the five genera studied. typing analysis suggested cross acquisition of e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus in three patient pairs. genomic polymorphism detection proved efficient and reliable for classifying bacterial subtypes isolated from biofilms adhering to various portions of commonly employed enteral access tubes.

TI  == in vitro investigations of the effect of probiotics and prebiotics on selected human intestinal pathogens.
AB  == abstract this study investigated the effects of selected probiotic microorganisms, in combination with prebiotics, on certain human intestinal food-borne pathogens. probiotics grown with different carbohydrate sources were observed to inhibit growth of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni and salmonella enteritidis, with the extent of inhibition varying according to the carbohydrate source provided. prebiotics identified as being preferentially utilised by the probiotics tested were oligofructose (fos), inulin, xylo-oligosaccharide (xos), and mixtures of inulin:fos (80:20 w/w) and fos:xos (50:50 w/w). two of the probiotics, lactobacillus plantarum and bifidobacterium bifidum were selected for further co-culture experiments. each was combined with  the selected prebiotics, and was observed to inhibit pathogen growth strongly. results suggested that acetate and lactate were directly conferring antagonistic  action, which was not necessarily related to a lowering of culture ph.

TI  == binding and activation of thiamin diphosphate in acetohydroxyacid synthase.
AB  == acetohydroxyacid synthases (ahass) are biosynthetic thiamin diphosphate- (thdp) and fad-dependent enzymes. they are homologous to pyruvate oxidase and other members of a family of thdp-dependent enzymes which catalyze reactions in which the first step is decarboxylation of a 2-ketoacid. ahas catalyzes the condensation of the 2-carbon moiety, derived from the decarboxylation of pyruvate, with a second 2-ketoacid, to form acetolactate or acetohydroxybutyrate. a structural model for ahas isozyme ii (ahas ii) from escherichia coli has been constructed on the basis of its homology with pyruvate oxidase from lactobacillus plantarum (lppox). we describe here experiments which further test the model, and test whether the binding and activation of thdp in ahas involve the same structural elements and mechanism identified for homologous enzymes. interaction  of a conserved glutamate with the n1' of the thdp aminopyrimidine moiety is involved in activation of the cofactor for proton exchange in several thdp-dependent enzymes. in accord with this, the analogue n3'-pyridyl thiamin diphosphate does not support ahas activity. mutagenesis of glu47, the putative conserved glutamate, decreases the rate of proton exchange at c-2 of bound thdp by nearly 2 orders of magnitude and decreases the turnover rate for the mutants by about 10-fold. mutant e47a also has altered substrate specificity, ph dependence, and other changes in properties. mutagenesis of asp428, presumed on the basis of the model to be the crucial carboxylate ligand to mg(2+) in the "thdp motif", leads to a decrease in the affinity of ahas ii for mg(2+). while mutant d428n shows thdp affinity close to that of the wild-type on saturation with mg(2+), d428e has a decreased affinity for thdp. these mutations also lead to dependence of the enzyme on k(+). these experiments demonstrate that ahas binds and activates thdp in the same way as do pyruvate decarboxylase, transketolase, and other thdp-dependent enzymes. the biosynthetic activity of ahas also involves many other factors beyond the binding and deprotonation of thdp; changes in the ligands to thdp can have interesting and unexpected effects  on the reaction.

TI  == evidence for dual functionality of the operon plnabcd in the regulation of bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == the regulatory operon (plnabcd) involved in bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum c11 encodes four different proteins: a cationic prepeptide (plna); a histidine protein kinase (plnb); and two highly homologous response regulators (plnc and plnd; over 75% sequence similarity). the mature product of plna, plantaricin a, serves as an extracellular pheromone that induces bacteriocin production. the exact roles of plnbcd in bacteriocin production have  not been established experimentally. a reporter system containing the gusa gene fused with the plna promoter was used to study plnabcd. we demonstrated that the  plnabcd operon codes for an autoregulatory unit capable of activating its own promoter. deletion analyses, performed in a heterologous expression host to define the roles of the individual genes, confirmed that both the inducer gene (plna) and the kinase gene (plnb) are required for autoactivation. apparently, the latter gene encodes a protein that serves as a receptor for the pheromone peptide. it was also demonstrated conclusively that the two regulators plnc and plnd, which have been shown previously to bind specifically to the dna regulatory repeats of the plna promoter, possess differential activities on the plna promoter, with plnc being much more active than plnd. the functions of the response regulators were investigated further in the bacteriocin producer strain  c11 in order to reveal their roles in bacteriocin production. surprisingly, the two response regulators display totally opposite functions: although overexpression of plnc activated transcription and bacteriocin production, the overexpression of plnd repressed both processes, thus strongly suggesting that plnd plays a role in the downregulation of bacteriocin synthesis. to our knowledge, this is the first evidence for a protein involved directly in negative regulation of bacteriocin production, and also it was shown for the first time that two highly homologous response regulators, with opposite functions, are encoded by genes located on the same operon.

TI  == [evaluation of the bacterial flora in natural corn silage].
AB  == silage is the best method for forage conservation, keeping it in a fresh condition and with high nutrient content. in order to study the natural evolution of maize silage without additives during 50 days after sealed, ph, temperature changes, number and type of the indigenous bacteria were studied every 5 days. the initial ph decreased from 6.40 to 4.10 and temperature stabilized at 26 degrees c. the mesophilic aerobic bacteria were quickly reduced across time. enterococci were descended gradually. clostridia remained in a low quantity. the  microorganisms most frequently isolated were escherichia coli, clostridium butyricum, enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum; this acid lactic bacteria was the principal cause of the abundant production of anaerobic fermentation of sugars in the forage reaching the ph which maintained the silage  in adequate conditions.

TI  == microbiological and biochemical characteristics of canestrato pugliese cheese made from raw milk, pasteurized milk or by heating the curd in hot whey.
AB  == canestrato pugliese cheeses were produced from raw ewes' milk (r and r(ii) cheeses), pasteurized ewes' milk (p cheese) and by heating the curd in hot whey according to a traditional protocol (t cheese). r(ii) differed from r cheese mainly by having been produced from raw milk with a higher number of somatic cells, 950.000 vs. 750.000 ml(-1), respectively. compared to p and t cheeses, r and r(ii) cheeses had a higher concentration (one or two orders of magnitude) of  cheese-related bacteria such as adventitious mesophilic lactobacilli, enterococci and staphylococci. at the end of ripening, all cheeses contained less than 1.0 log cfu g(-1) of total and fecal coliforms, and escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus were not detected. as shown by phenotypic identification and rapd-pcr, r cheese contained the largest number of mesophilic lactobacilli species and the greatest diversity of strains within the lactobacillus plantarum  species. primary proteolysis did not differ appreciably among the cheeses. on the contrary, both urea-page and the rp-hplc analyses of the water-soluble n fractions showed the more complex profiles in cheeses produced by raw milks. r and r(ii) cheeses had the highest values of water-soluble n/total n (ca. 30%) and the highest concentration of total free amino acids (ca. 40 mg g(-1) which approached or exceeded those reported for italian cheeses with very high level of proteolysis during ripening. the main differences between r-r(ii) and p-t cheeses were the concentrations of aspartic acid, proline, alanine, isoleucine, histidine and lysine. the water-soluble extracts of r and r(ii) cheeses contained levels of amino-, imino- and di-peptidase activities, which were about twice those found in p and t cheeses. cheeses differed slightly in the concentration of total free fatty acids that ranged between 1673 and 1651 mg kg(-1) in r and r(ii) cheeses, and 1397 and 1334 mg kg(-1) in p and t cheeses. butyric, caproic, capric, palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids were found at the highest concentrations.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from plants against selected pathogenic  and saprophytic microorganisms.
AB  == the beneficial health effects of extracts from many types of plants that are used as seasoning agents in foods and beverages have been claimed for centuries. the purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of selected herb and spice essential oils for control of growth and survival of microorganisms. inhibition of growth was tested by the paper disc agar diffusion method. antibiotic susceptibility discs were used as control. minimum lethal concentration (mlc) was determined by the tube dilution method. essential oils from anise, angelica, basil, carrot, celery, cardamom, coriander, dill weed, fennel, oregano, parsley,  and rosemary were evaluated. inhibition ranged from complete with oregano to no inhibition with carrot oil for each of the test strains that included: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o:157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lactobacillus plantarum, aspergillus niger, geotrichum, and rhodotorula. oregano essential oil showed the greatest inhibition (zone, > or = 70 to 80 mm) (mlc, approximately 8 ppm). coriander and basil were also highly inhibitory (mlc, approximately 25 to 50 ppm) to e. coli o:157:h7 and to the other bacteria and fungi tested. anise oil was not particularly inhibitory to bacteria (inhibition zone, approximately 25 mm); however, anise oil was highly inhibitory to molds. because some of the herbal and spice essential oils are highly inhibitory to selected pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms, they may provide alternatives and supplements to conventional antimicrobial additives in foods.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

AB  == bacteriophage sc921, which can infect lactobacillus plantarum specifically, was isolated from a fermented vegetable source, kimchi. this phage is active against  six of 11 strains of l. plantarum tested as hosts. morphologically, it has an isometric head (60 nm in diameter) and a non-contractile tail (260 nm long and 9-11 nm wide), indicating that it belongs to bradley's group b or the siphoviridae family according to the international committee on taxonomy of viruses (ictv). the bouyant density was 1.58 g/cm3. sds-page experimentation indicated that the phage particle contains two major structural proteins and several minor proteins. the genome was a double stranded linear dna molecule with cohesive ends and 66.5 kb long by mapping genomic dna digested with the restriction endonucleases: kpni, smai, and xbai. the [g + c] content of the phage dna is 39.4%. for this lysin gene study, 9.4 kb of kpni-digested dna fragment was cloned into puc19 and expressed in escherichia coli. the kpni fragment was considered as the genetic element responsible for the lysis gene of l. plantarum  bacteriophage. the cloned fragment in puc19 was hybridized to a 9.4-kb fragment generated by kpni digestion of sc 921 as a probe. this confirmed that the fragment in puc19 originated from phage dna. the lysin gene was near the middle of the phage genome.

TI  == identification of a non-haem catalase in salmonella and its regulation by rpos (sigmas).
AB  == we report the identification and functional analysis of katn, a gene encoding a non-haem catalase of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. katn, which is not present in escherichia coli, is located between the ycigfe and ycid e. coli homologues in the salmonella genome. its predicted protein product has a molecular weight of 31 826 da and is similar to the mn-catalases of lactobacillus plantarum and thermus spp. its product, katn, was visualized as a 37 kda protein  in e. coli maxicells. a katn recombinant protein, containing six histidine residues at its c-terminus, was purified, and its catalase activity was observed  on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. katn was also visualized by catalase activity gel staining of bacterial cell extracts. its expression was shown to be  regulated by growth phase and rpos. northern blotting indicated that kat forms an operon with the upstream ycigfe genes. a putative rpos-regulated promoter was identified upstream of ycig. southern blotting revealed that katn is conserved within salmonella serovars. katn homologues were found in pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. a katn mutation did not appear to affect the hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) response of salmonella. however, the expression of katn increased the h2o2 resistance of unadapted cells in the exponential phase and of rpos mutants in stationary phase. thus, katn may contribute to hydrogen peroxide resistance in salmonella in certain environmental conditions.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum reduces infection of pancreatic necrosis in experimental  acute pancreatitis.
AB  == background: infection is the commonest cause of death in acute pancreatitis. early reduction of commensal flora (particularly lactobacillus species) and, at the same time, overgrowth of enterobacteriaceae, especially escherichia coli, have recently been described during acute pancreatitis. lactobacillus plantarum has been shown to be effective in reducing the egress of endotoxin and microbial  translocation in several experimental models such as chemically induced hepatitis and ulcerative colitis. aim: the aim of the study was to determine whether l. plantarum 299v (lp 299v) is capable of effectively reducing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis. methods: acute pancreatitis was induced by isolation and ligation of the biliopancreatic duct in lewis rats weighing 250-350 g. the animals were divided into 3 groups: group a, sham operation; group b, induction of pancreatitis and no further treatment, and group c, induction of pancreatitis + daily administration by gavage of a 5-ml/day suspension of lp 299v at 0.5-1.0 x 10(9) bacteria/ml for 8 days, 4 days before and 4 days after induction of pancreatitis. all animals were sacrificed after 96  h. histological studies and microbiological analyses were performed. results: at  sacrifice, 40/55 animals showed signs of severe pancreatitis. since acute pancreatitis was the specific disease investigated, only these animals were subjected to further study. in group b, we found pathogenic micro-organisms in the mesenteric lymph nodes in 14/20 animals and in the pancreatic tissue in 10/20. the bacterial flora consisted predominantly of e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas and proteus species. in contrast, when the animals were kept under an 'umbrella' of lp 299v, growth of e. faecalis or e. coli were detected only in 4/20 mesenteric lymph node cultures and in 3/20 pancreatic tissue cultures. conclusions: lp 299v is effective in reducing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis. treatment with probiotic bacteria seems to be a promising alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == expression in escherichia coli of native and chimeric phenolic acid decarboxylases with modified enzymatic activities and method for screening recombinant e. coli strains expressing these enzymes.
AB  == four bacterial phenolic acid decarboxylases (pad) from lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus pumilus were expressed in escherichia coli, and their activities on p-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic acids were compared. although these four enzymes displayed 61% amino acid sequence identity, they exhibit different activities for ferulic and caffeic acid metabolism. to elucidate the domain(s) that determines these differences, chimeric pad proteins were constructed and expressed in e. coli by exchanging their individual carboxy-terminal portions. analysis of the chimeric enzyme activities suggests that the c-terminal region may be involved in determining pad substrate specificity and catalytic capacity. in order to test phenolic acid toxicity, the levels of growth of recombinant e. coli displaying and not displaying pad activity were compared on medium supplemented with different concentrations of phenolic acids and with differing phs. though these acids already have a slight inhibitory effect on e. coli, vinyl phenol derivatives, created during decarboxylation of phenolic acids, were much more inhibitory to the e. coli control strain. to take advantage of this property, a solid medium with the appropriate ph and phenolic acid concentration was developed; in this medium the recombinant e. coli strains expressing pad activity form colonies approximately five times smaller than those formed by strains devoid of pad activity.

TI  == reduction of fecal shedding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 in lambs by feeding microbial feed supplement.
AB  == enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7, an emerging food-borne pathogen, has  been implicated in several outbreaks in the us. ruminants, including cattle, sheep and deer are reservoirs of e. coli o157:h7 and fecal shedding of the pathogen forms the vehicle of entry into the human food chain. we studied the efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus faecium, a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium and a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus plantarum in reducing fecal shedding of e. coli o157:h7 by sheep experimentally infected with  the pathogen prior to administration with the microbials. following oral inoculation with 10(10)cfu of e. coli o157:h7, 30 suffolk ram lambs were blocked  by body weight (six blocks of five lambs each) and lambs within the block randomly assigned to five groups. the lamb groups were fed daily for 7 weeks a basal diet without microbial supplement (control) or the basal diet with l. acidophilus or with s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus and s. faecium or with a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum. the microbial supplements contained stabilized live naturally occurring bacteria and were mixed with the diet at the rate of 6.0x10(6)cfu per kilogram of diet. fecal samples were collected weekly and analyzed for e. coli o157:h7 using modified tryptic soy broth with novobiocin as a pre-enrichement broth and cefixim-tellurite sorbitol macconkey agar (ct-smac) as a selective media. e. coli o157:h7 was confirmed by its reaction with o157 and h7 antisera. e. coli o157:h7 was shed continuously and in varying numbers in the feces throughout the 7-week experimental period by all five groups. however, lambs administered a mixture of l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and  l. plantarum shed significantly lower (p=0.0211) average number of e. coli o157:h7 (2.3log(10)cfu per gram of feces per week) than the other lamb groups over the entire experimental period. s. faecium supplemented lambs were comparable (p=0.0884) to lambs fed a mixture of l. acidophulus and s. faecium in  fecal shedding of the pathogen (3.5 versus 4.4log(10)cfu per gram of feces) but significantly lower (p=0.0001) than the control lambs (5.6log(10)cfu per gram of  feces) and those supplemented with l. acidophilus (5.5log(10)cfu per gram of feces). average daily gain (adg) and gain to feed ratio (g:f) were significantly  improved (p=0.0145) by the mixed culture microbials (163.0g and 0.33 for the control, 186.4g and 0.37 for l. acidophulus, 168.2g and 0.36 for s. faecium, 213.6g and 0.46 for l. acidophulus and s. faecium, and 219.1g and 0.44, respectively for l. acidophilus, s. faecium, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum supplemented lambs. the study indicates that supplementing lambs infected with e. coli o157:h7 with s. faecium or a mixture of s. faecium, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. plantarum in the diet can reduce total number of e. coli o157:h7 shed in the feces and improve animal meat production performance as well.

AB  == pediococcus pentosaceus displays a substrate-inducible phenolic acid decarboxylase (pad) activity on p-coumaric acid. based on dna sequence homologies between the three pads previously cloned, a dna probe of the lactobacillus plantarum pdc gene was used to screen a p. pentosaceus genomic library in order to clone the corresponding gene of this bacteria. one clone detected with this probe displayed a low pad activity. subcloning of this plasmid insertion allowed  us to determine the part of the insert which contains a 534-bp open reading frame (orf) coding for a 178-amino-acid protein presenting 81.5% of identity with l. plantarum pdc enzyme. this orf was identified as the pada gene. a second orf was  located just downstream of the pada gene and displayed 37% identity with the product of the bacillus subtilis yfio gene. subcloning, transcriptional analysis, and expression studies with escherichia coli of these two genes under the pada gene promoter, demonstrated that the genes are organized in an autoregulated bicistronic operonic structure and that the gene located upstream of the pada gene encodes the transcriptional repressor of the pada gene. transcription of this pad operon in p. pentosaceus is acid phenol dependent.

AB  == the promoter-like sequence p15 that was previously cloned from the chromosome of  lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 is active in lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, and escherichia coli, but not in lactococcus lactis. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n-guanidine (mnng) mutagenesis of p15 was used to select for a promoter active in l. lactis mg1363. molecular analysis  of the mutated promoter (designated p16) revealed a 90 bp deletion and a t-->a transversion. this deletion, in combination with the addition to the transversion, created a promoter with putative -35 and -10 hexamers identical to  the consensus promoter sequence found in e. coli and bacillus subtilis vegetative promoters. the activity of p16 was measured by its ability to promote chloramphenicol resistance in different bacteria when inserted in the promoter-probe plasmid pbv5030 (designated pla16). the mic of chloramphenicol in  l. lactis, l. reuteri, l. plantarum, e. coli, and l. acidophilus harbouring pla16 were 30, 170, 180, > 500, and 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. this represents an increase in promoter activity compared to p15 in l. reuteri of 3-fold, in l. plantarum of 9-fold, and in e. coli of at least 2.5-fold, but a decrease in l. acidophilus of 7-fold.

AB  == pediococcus pentosaceus pep1 is a vacuum-packaged turkish sausage isolate which produces a potentially novel bacteriocin of the pediocin (anti-listeria) family of peptides designated as pediocin p. curing experiments and plasmid profile analysis indicated that both bacteriocin immunity and production determinants were linked and encoded by 9.0 mda plasmid, phd1.0. attempts to transform purified plasmid phd1.0 into recipient escherichia coli jm109 cells by electroporation were successful but none of the e. coli jm109 cells were able to  express and/or release pediocin p. however, p. pentosaceus pc, a plasmid-cured variant of p. pentosaceus pep1 was successfully transformed with phd1.0 by electroporation and bac-bacs p. pentosaceus pc cells restarted to express and/or  release pediocin p again as indicated by the presence of zone of growth inhibition of l. plantarum ncdo 955 around colonies.

TI  == purification and dna-binding properties of the cro-type regulatory repressor protein cng encoded by the lactobacillus plantarum phage phi g1e.
AB  == the putative repressor protein cng (10kda on an sds gel) for the lytic pathway of lactobacillus plantarum phage &phi;g1e was purified using the escherichia coli pt7 system, and its dna-binding ability for the seven operator-like sequences, the gatac-boxes (gb1 to gb7), was investigated in vitro. in gel-shift assays, cng selectively bound to the dna fragments containing the gatac-box(es). in addition, dnase i footprinting analysis with supercoiled dna demonstrated that cng can specifically cover about a 25bp region centered around each of the gatac-boxes, although two boxes, gb4 and gb6, were only partially protected. moreover, protein crosslinking experiments using glutaraldehyde suggested that cng most likely functions as a dimer. on the other hand, the binding ability of cpg for the gatac-boxes in supercoiled dna was also examined under the same conditions as in  cng; unlike cng, cpg covered gb4 and gb6 completely sufficiently as well as the other five boxes. thus, the present and previous [kakikawa et al., gene 215 (1998) 371-379; 242 (2000) 155-166] results indicate a possibility that the two proteins cng and cpg selectively bind to the gatac-boxes that act as operators, and can decide between the lytic or lysogenic pathways through repression of the  promoter activity of p(r) as well as p(l).

TI  == a physical and functional analysis of the newly-identified bglgpt operon of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == a newly-identified bglgpt operon of lactobacillus plantarum was isolated and expressed in escherichia coli. the sequence analysis of the cloned dna fragment showed three open reading frames encoding (i) a 237-amino acid protein (bglg), (ii) a 577-amino acid protein (bglp) and (iii) a 486-amino acid protein (bglt). bglg, bglp and bglt were shown to be homologous to the bglg family of transcriptional antiterminators, to permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and to beta-glucosidases, respectively. complementation of e. coli mutant strains showed that bglp and bglt are a permease and a beta-glucosidase active on the beta-glucosides, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-glucoside, respectively. bglg was also shown to promote expression of a bglg-lacz gene fusion in an e. coli bglg(-) background. a ribonucleic antiterminator sequence, the antiterminator-responsive cis-element and a 'catabolite responsive element', were found downstream of the transcriptional start point. transcription of the operon was repressed 10-fold in l. plantarum cells grown on glucose as compared to ribose.

TI  == [a probiotic as an antagonist of bacterial translocation in experimental pancreatitis].
AB  == infection is the most common cause of death in acute pancreatitis. earlier studies have demonstrated that early enteral nutrition decreases microbial translocation, upregulates the immune function and reduces septic complications and mortality. lactobacillus plantarum (lp) has been shown to be effective in reducing egress of endotoxin and microbial strain that showed very high adherence power to gut mucosa. we adopted a model of acute pancreatitis induced by isolation and ligation of biliopancreatic duct in adult lewis rats. three groups  were studied: a. control group (sham operation); b. induced pancreatitis, no further treatment; c. induced pancreatitis + gavage with 5 ml/day of a suspension of lp 299 v in a dose of 0.5-1.0 x 10(9)/ml during 4 days before and 4 days after induction of pancreatitis. all animals were sacrificed after 96 hours. histological studies and microbiological analyses were performed. forty out of 55 animals showed signs of severe pancreatitis on sacrifice after 96 hours. only these animals were further studied. in group a, we found only 1/20 bacteria in mesenteric nodes (mn). pathogenic microrganisms were found in the non-treated group in mn in 14/20 and in the pancreatic tissue in 10/20. in contrast, when kept on an umbrella of lp 299 v, only 4/20 animals demonstrated growth of enteric bacteria in mn and 3/20 in pancreatic tissue. all of these results showed a significant reduction of infection in the treated groups. in our model, lp 299 v  is effective in preventing microbial translocation in experimental pancreatitis.  treatment with probiotic bacteria, such as lactobacillus spp, seems to be a promising alternative as problems with antibiotic-resistant bacteria seem to accumulate.

TI  == the genetic switch for the regulatory pathway of lactobacillus plantarum phage (phi)g1e: characterization of the promoter p(l), the repressor gene cpg, and the  cpg-encoded protein cpg in escherichia coli.
AB  == the structural and functional features of the approximately 530 bp p(l)/gb5-gb6-cpg-gb7 region (p(l) overlaps gb5) for the lysogenic pathway of l. plantarum phage (phi)gle were investigated using the cat gene of e. coli plasmid  pkk232-8 as a reporter. in e. coli xl1-blue, a recombinant plasmid pkpl2 (cat under p(l)/gb5-gb6) exhibited distinct cat activity, whereas the activity of pkplcp1 (cat under p(l)/gb5-gb6-cpg) was only marginal. when pkpl2 was coexistent with a compatible derivative of plasmid pacyc177 carrying p(l)/gb5-gb6-cpg, the cat activity was declined to the level of pkplcp1. on the other hand, the cpg-encoded protein cpg was overproduced in e. coli under p(t7). the molecular mass of the purified cpg (14.5 kda on a sds gel) corresponded well with that (15.1 kda) predicted from the dna sequence. gel-shift and footprinting assays demonstrated that cpg selectively binds to about 25 bp bases centered around the  gatac-box (from 1 to 7). moreover, protein crosslinking experiments using glutaraldehyde showed that cpg most likely functions as a dimeric form. thus, the present results indicate that cpg probably represses p(l) through binding to the  operator gatac-box(es), and the p(l)/cpg region might participate in the lysogenic pathway.

TI  == cloning, expression, and characterization of cadmium and manganese uptake genes from lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == an mn(2+) and cd(2+) uptake gene, mnta, was cloned from lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917 into escherichia coli. its expression conferred on e. coli cells increased cd(2+) sensitivity as well as energy-dependent cd(2+) uptake activity.  both transcription and translation of mnta were induced by mn(2+) starvation in l. plantarum, as indicated by reverse transcriptase pcr and immunoblotting. two cd(2+) uptake systems have been identified in l. plantarum: one is a high-affinity mn(2+) and cd(2+) uptake system that is expressed in mn(2+)-starved cells, and the other is a nonsaturable cd(2+) uptake system that is expressed in  cd(2+)-sufficient cells (z. hao, h. r. reiske, and d. b. wilson, appl. environ. microbiol. 65:592-99, 1999). mnta was not detected in an mn(2+)-dependent mutant  of l. plantarum which had lost high-affinity mn(2+) and cd(2+) uptake activity. the results suggest that mnta is the gene encoding the high-affinity mn(2+) and cd(2+) transporter. on the basis of its predicted amino acid sequence, mnta belongs to the family of p-type cation-translocating atpases. the topology and potential mn(2+)- and cd(2+)-binding sites of mnta are discussed. a second clone  containing a low-affinity cd(2+) transport system was also isolated.

TI  == synergistic actions of nisin, sublethal ultrahigh pressure, and reduced temperature on bacteria and yeast.
AB  == nisin in combination with ultrahigh-pressure treatment (uhp) showed strong synergistic effects against lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli at reduced temperatures (<15 degrees c). the strongest inactivation effects were observed when nisin was present during pressure treatment and in the recovery medium. elimination (>6-log reductions) of l. plantarum was achieved at 10 degrees c with synergistic combinations of 0.5 microg of nisin per ml at 150 mpa  and 0.1 microg of nisin per ml at 200 mpa for 10 min. additive effects of nisin and uhp accounted for only 1.2- and 3.7-log reductions, respectively. elimination was also achieved for e. coli at 10 degrees c with nisin present at 2 microg/ml,  and 10 min of pressure at 200 mpa, whereas the additive effect accounted for only 2.6-log reductions. slight effects were observed even against the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae with nisin present at 5 microg/ml and with 200 mpa of pressure. combining nisin, uhp, and lowered temperature may allow considerable reduction in time and/or pressure of uhp treatments. kill can be complete without the frequently encountered survival tails in uhp processing. the slightly enhanced synergistic kill with uhp at reduced temperatures was also observed for  other antimicrobials, the synthetic peptides mb21 and histatin 5. the postulated  mode of action was that the reduced temperature and the binding of peptides to the membrane increased the efficacy of uhp treatment. the increases in fatty acid saturation or diphosphatidylglycerol content and the lysylphosphatidyl content of the cytoplasm membrane of l. plantarum were correlated with increased susceptibility to uhp and nisin, respectively.

AB  == curing of a plasmid that encoded a beta-galactosidase gene (beta-gal) from the lactobacillus plantarum strain of dairy origin ll441 was not accompanied by complete loss of the lactose utilization phenotype. dna-dna hybridization, using  an internal fragment of the beta-gal gene as a probe, revealed a second determinant located on the chromosome of the cured derivatives. the chromosomal copy was present in all of a series of beta-gal+ l. plantarum and lactobacillus pentosus strains from different origins. in addition, four other l. plantarum strains harboured plasmid encoded beta-gal genes as well. since both sequences cross-hybridized and present a similar genetic organization, it is postulated that the plasmid copy was generated through gene duplication and, probably, selected by growth of the strains in lactose rich environments.

TI  == lactobacilli from human gastrointestinal mucosa are strong stimulators of il-12 production.
AB  == interaction of macrophages with bacteria is a stimulus for production of cytokines such as il-10 and il-12. il-12 stimulates t cell and natural killer (nk) cell cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) production. il-10 opposes the t cell-stimulating action of il-12, decreases the release of proinflammatory  cytokines from macrophages, and stimulates b cells. we have studied the capacity  of human intestinal isolates from the three lactobacillus species dominating on the human gastrointestinal mucosa, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. paracasei ssp. paracasei, to induce production of il-10 and il-12 from human blood mononuclear cells, or monocytes. whole killed lactobacilli were potent stimulators of il-12 over a wide range of bacterial concentrations. lactobacillus paracasei gave the highest levels of il-12 (1.5 ng/ml in response to 5 x 106 bacteria/ml), roughly 10 times more than obtained by stimulation with l. rhamnosus or l. plantarum. escherichia coli induced on average < 50 pg/ml of il-12 regardless of the bacterial concentration used. the secretion of free p40 subunit il-12 followed the same pattern as the secretion of p70 (bioactive il-12) with regard to the efficiency of different bacteria as stimulators. escherichia coli was the most efficient trigger of il-10 production, inducing 0.5 ng/ml il-10 after stimulation with 5 x 106 bacteria/ml. lactobacillus rhamnosus induced the highest levels of il-10 among the lactobacilli (0.5 ng/ml) compared with 0.1 ng/ml evoked by l. plantarum or l. paracasei, but 10 times more bacteria were required for optimal stimulation than with e. coli. when neutralizing anti-il-10  antibodies were added to the cultures, the il-12-inducing capacity of l. rhamnosus was increased markedly, while that of e. coli remained low. the results show that mucosa-associated lactobacilli can be potent stimulators of il-12, and  thus potentially of cell-mediated immunity, if they pass over the gut epithelial  barrier and interact with cells of the gut immune system.

AB  == probiotic agents, live microorganisms with beneficial effects for the host, may offer an alternative to conventional antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of enteric infections. the probiotic agents lactobacillus plantarum 299v and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg quantitatively inhibited the adherence of an  attaching and effacing pathogenic escherichia coli to ht-29 intestinal epithelial cells but did not inhibit adherence to nonintestinal hep-2 cells. ht-29 cells were grown under conditions that induced high levels of either muc2 or muc3 mrna, but hep-2 cells expressed only minimal levels of muc2 and no muc3 mrna. media enriched for muc2 and muc3 mucin were added exogenously to binding assays and were shown to be capable of inhibiting enteropathogen adherence to hep-2 cells. incubation of l. plantarum 299v with ht-29 cells increased muc2 and muc3 mrna expression levels. from these in vitro studies, we propose the hypothesis that the ability of probiotic agents to inhibit adherence of attaching and effacing organisms to intestinal epithelial cells is mediated through their ability to increase expression of muc2 and muc3 intestinal mucins.

TI  == escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum responses to osmotic stress.
AB  == escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum were subjected to final water potentials of -5.6 mpa and -11.5 mpa with three solutes: glycerol, sorbitol and nacl. the water potential decrease was realized either rapidly (osmotic shock) or slowly (20 min) and a difference in cell viability between these conditions was only observed when the solute was nacl. the cell mortality during osmotic shocks  induced by nacl cannot be explained by a critical volume decrease or by the intensity of the water flow across the cell membrane. when the osmotic stress is  realized with nacl as the solute, in a medium in which osmoregulation cannot take place, the application of a slow decrease in water potential resulted in the significant maintenance of cell viability (about 70-90%) with regard to the corresponding viability observed after a sudden step change to same final water potential (14-40%). this viability difference can be explained by the existence of a critical internal free na+ concentration.

AB  == a 3-kb region, located downstream of the lactobacillus brevis xyla gene (encoding d-xylose isomerase), was cloned in escherichia coli tg1. the sequence revealed two open reading frames which could code for the d-xylulose kinase gene (xylb) and another gene (xylt) encoding a protein of 457 amino acids with significant similarity to the d-xylose-h+ symporters of e. coli, xyle (57%), and bacillus megaterium, xylt (58%), to the d-xylose-na+ symporter of tetragenococcus halophila, xyle (57%), and to the l-arabinose-h+ symporter of e. coli, arae (60%). the l. brevis xylabt genes showed an arrangement similar to that of the b. megaterium xylabt operon and the t. halophila xylabe operon. southern hybridization performed with the lactobacillus pentosus xylr gene (encoding the d-xylose repressor protein) as a probe revealed the existence of a xylr homologue in l. brevis which is not located with the xyabt locus. the existence of a functional xylr was further suggested by the presence of xylo sequences upstream  of xyla and xylt and by the requirement of d-xylose for the induction of d-xylose isomerase, d-xylulose kinase, and d-xylose transport activities in l. brevis. when l. brevis was cultivated in a mixture of d-glucose and d-xylose, the d-xylose isomerase and d-xylulose kinase activities were reduced fourfold and the d-xylose transport activity was reduced by sixfold, suggesting catabolite repression by d-glucose of d-xylose assimilation. the xylt gene was functionally  expressed in lactobacillus plantarum 80, a strain which lacks proton motive force-linked d-xylose transport activity. the role of the xylt protein was confirmed by the accumulation of d-xylose in l. plantarum 80 cells, and this accumulation was dependent on the proton motive force generated by either malolactic fermentation or by the metabolism of d-glucose. the apparent affinity  constant of xylt for d-xylose was approximately 215 microm, and the maximal initial velocity of transport was 35 nmol/min per mg (dry weight). furthermore, of a number of sugars tested, only 6-deoxy-d-glucose inhibited the transport of d-xylose by xylt competitively, with a ki of 220 microm.

AB  == the lactobacillus plantarum phage og1e (42<hsp sp = "0. 25">259<hsp sp = "0.25">bp) has two repressor-like genes cng and cpg oriented oppositely, accompanied by three potential promoters pr, pl and pr49, and seven operator-like sequences (gatac-boxes) (kodaira et al., 1997). in this study, the og1e putative  promoters were introduced into the escherichia coli promoter-detecting plasmid pkk232-8. in e. coli ck111, pr (pkpr1), pl (pkpl1) and pr49 (pkpr49) exhibited distinct cat activities. when pkpr1 or pkpl1 was coexistent with a compatible plasmid pacyc184 carrying pr-cng (pa4prcn1), the cat activity was decreased significantly. on the other hand, cng directed a protein (cng) of 10.1 kda in e.  coli under the control of t7 promoter. gel mobility-shift assays demonstrated that cng binds specifically to a dna region containing the gatac-boxes. in addition, primer extension analyses demonstrated that the two sequences pr and pl act as a promoter in l. plantarum as well as in e. coli. these results suggested  that the potential promoters pr and pl probably function for the lytic and lysogenic pathways, respectively, and cng may act as a repressor presumably through the gatac-boxes as operators.

TI  == expression of the bglh gene of lactobacillus plantarum is controlled by carbon catabolite repression.
AB  == a newly identified bglh gene coding for a phospho-beta-glucosidase of lactobacillus plantarum was isolated and expressed in escherichia coli. the sequence analysis of the cloned dna fragment showed an open reading frame encoding a 480-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 53 kda. the bglh gene was shown to be expressed on a monocistronic transcriptional unit. its  transcription was repressed 10-fold in l. plantarum cells grown on glucose compared to the beta-glucoside salicin as a sole carbon source. a catabolite-responsive element (cre) spanning from -3 to +11 with respect to the transcriptional start point was found, and its functionality was assessed by mutational analysis. in vitro and in vivo dna binding experiments suggested the occurrence of a dna-protein complex at the cre site, which would mediate glucose  repression of bglh expression.

TI  == isolation and characterization of pediocin ach chimeric protein mutants with altered bactericidal activity.
AB  == a collection of pediocin ach amino acid substitution mutants was generated by pcr random mutagenesis of dna encoding the bacteriocin. mutants were isolated by cloning mutagenized dna into an escherichia coli male plasmid that directs the secretion of maltose binding protein-pediocin ach chimeric proteins and by screening transformant colonies for bactericidal activity against lactobacillus plantarum ncdo955 (k. w. miller, r. schamber, y. chen, and b. ray, 1998. appl. environ. microbiol. 64:14-20, 1998). in all, 17 substitution mutants were isolated at 14 of the 44 amino acids of pediocin ach. seven mutants (n5k, c9r, c14s, c14y, g37e, g37r, and c44w) were completely inactive against the pediocin ach-sensitive strains l. plantarum ncdo955, listeria innocua lin11, enterococcus  faecalis m1, pediococcus acidilactici lb42, and leuconostoc mesenteroides ly. a c24s substitution mutant constructed by other means also was inactive against these bacteria. nine other mutants (k1n, w18r, i26t, m31t, a34d, n41k, h42l, k43n, and k43e) retained from <1% to approximately 60% of wild-type activity when assayed against l. innocua lin11. one mutant, k11e, displayed approximately 2. 8-fold-higher activity against this indicator. about one half of the mutations mapped to amino acids that are conserved in the pediocin-like family of bacteriocins. all four cysteines were found to be required for activity, although only c9 and c14 are conserved among pediocin-like bacteriocins. several basic amino acids as well as nonpolar amino acids located within the hydrophobic c-terminal region also were found to be important. the mutations are discussed in the context of structural models that have been proposed for the bacteriocin.

AB  == lactobacillus plantarum ncim 2084 produced an antibacterial substance when grown  at 40 degrees c for 36 h in a laboratory medium. the antibacterial substance was  active against a wide range of bacteria comprising gram positive and negative foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. however, related mesophilic lactobacilli were not inhibited, except for l. amylovorus dsm 20531. the antimicrobial activity was observed between late log and stationary growth phases. the antibacterial substance was partially purified through concentration  under vacuum, followed by extraction with methanol and acetone (m-a extract). on  fractionation of the m-a extract through sephadex g-25, the activity was present  in an eluant volume of 85 to 100 ml (peak i), indicating an apparent molecular mass of between 1 and 5 kda and the purification attained was 80-fold. the antimicrobial principle was stable to heat (121 degrees c for 20 min) and catalase, but sensitive to trypsin and chymotrypsin, indicating it to be a bacteriocin. the m-a extract exhibited a bactericidal and lytic effect against bacillus cereus f 4810 and escherichia coli d 21. the ability of l. plantarum ncim 2084 to produce an effective bacteriocin in a simple growth medium is of potential interest in its application as a biopreservative in traditional fermented foods.

TI  == gene cloning, transcriptional analysis, purification, and characterization of phenolic acid decarboxylase from bacillus subtilis.
AB  == bacillus subtilis displays a substrate-inducible decarboxylating activity with the following three phenolic acids: ferulic, p-coumaric, and caffeic acids. based on dna sequence homologies between the bacillus pumilus ferulate decarboxylase gene (fdc) (a. zago, g. degrassi, and c. v. bruschi, appl. environ. microbiol. 61:4484-4486, 1995) and the lactobacillus plantarum p-coumarate decarboxylase gene (pdc) (j.-f. cavin, l. barthelmebs, and c. divies, appl. environ. microbiol. 63:1939-1944, 1997), a dna probe of about 300 nucleotides for the l. plantarum pdc gene was used to screen a b. subtilis genomic library in order to clone the corresponding gene in this bacterium. one clone was detected with this heterologous probe, and this clone exhibited phenolic acid decarboxylase (pad) activity. the corresponding 5-kb insertion was partially sequenced and was found  to contain a 528-bp open reading frame coding for a 161-amino-acid protein exhibiting 71 and 84% identity with the pdc- and fdc-encoded enzymes, respectively. the pad gene (pad) is transcriptionally regulated by p-coumaric, ferulic, or caffeic acid; these three acids are the three substrates of pad. the  pad gene was overexpressed constitutively in escherichia coli, and the stable purified enzyme was characterized. the difference in substrate specificity between this pad and other pads seems to be related to a few differences in the amino acid sequence. therefore, this novel enzyme should facilitate identification of regions involved in catalysis and substrate specificity.

TI  == purification and dna-binding properties of the integrase protein int encoded by lactobacillus plantarum phage.
AB  == the lactobacillus plantarum temperate phage phi g1e (42,259 bp) encodes an integrase gene int linked to a phage attachment site attp (kakikawa et al., 1997). to investigate phi g1e recombination, the integrase protein int was overproduced in escherichia coli under the t7 promoter, and purified. the int protein had an apparent molecular mass of 42.0 kda, corresponding well with that  (45.5 kda) predicted from the dna sequence. amino-acid sequencing revealed that the n-terminal 20 amino-acids of the purified int protein completely coincided with those deduced from the dna sequence, although deficient in the first methionine. gel mobility-shift assays demonstrated that int bound specifically to the attp region. in addition, footprinting analysis showed that int protected about 35 bases, containing the 24-bp core domain at attp, from dnase i attack. these results are indicative of site-specific interaction of int with the attp site, the reaction prerequisite for integration and excision of the phi g1e genome into and/or out of the host chromosome.

TI  == aggregation-promoting factor in human vaginal lactobacillus strains.
AB  == a total of 60 lactobacillus sp. strains were examined for expression of auto-aggregation and cell surface hydrophobicity. isolates were obtained from the vagina of healthy women (n = 20). the results obtained showed that the occurrence of cell surface hydrophobicity correlated with auto-aggregative activity in 12 homofermentative lactobacillus sp. strains. the aggregation mechanism was mediated by the presence of an aggregation promoting factor (apf) in one lactobacillus sp. strain, hv 142. apf was confirmed by dna hybridisation with a 1.3 kb psti dna fragment of recombinant plasmid pfds containing the reading open  frame of the apf gene derived from lactobacillus plantarum 4b2. coaggregation activity was seen in three strains of auto-aggregative human vaginal lactobacilli and five strains of p-fimbriated uropathogenic escherichia coli. moreover, one of four lactobacillus sp. strains (hv 389) aggregated with two of five e. coli tested. these results suggest that apf producing lactobacilli could represent a further mechanism in the interaction of commensal microflora with strains of uropathogenic e. coli.

TI  == functional and structural features of the holin hol protein of the lactobacillus  plantarum phage phi gle: analysis in escherichia coli system.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum phage phi gle has two consecutive cell lysis genes hol-lys (oki et al., 1996b). in the present study, functional and structural properties of the hol protein (hol) were characterized in escherichia coli. electron microscopic examinations showed that hol under plac in e. coli xl1-blue  injured the inner membrane to yield empty ghost cells with the bulk of the cell wall undisturbed. northern blot analysis indicated that hol-lys genes under plac  were co-transcribed, although the amount of hol transcript was larger than that of lys, ceasing via an apparently rho-independent terminator just downstream of hol. however, deletion and/or fusion experiments suggested that: (1) the n-terminal half of phi gle hol composed of three putative transmembrane domains may be responsible for interaction with membrane; (2) the n-terminal end (five amino acids) seems nonessential; and (3) the c-terminal half containing charged amino acids appears to be involved in proper hol function. these results suggest  that phi gle hol is a member of the lambdoid holin family, but divergent in several properties from lambda holin.

TI  == 2-oxo-3-alkynoic acids, universal mechanism-based inactivators of thiamin diphosphate-dependent decarboxylases: synthesis and evidence for potent inactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex.
AB  == a new class of compounds, the 2-oxo-3-alkynoic acids with a phenyl substituent at carbon 4 was reported by the authors as potent irreversible and mechanism-based inhibitors of the thiamin diphosphate- (thdp-) dependent enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase [chiu, c.-f., & jordan, f. (1994) j. org. chem. 59, 5763-5766]. the method has been successfully extended to the synthesis of the 4-, 5-, and 7-carbon aliphatic members of this family of compounds. these three compounds were then tested on three thdp-dependent pyruvate decarboxylases: the escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (pdhc) and its e1 (thdp-dependent) component, pyruvate oxidase (pox, phosphorylating; from lactobacillus plantarum),and pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) from saccharomycescerevisiae. all three enzymes were irreversibly inhibited by the new compounds. the 4-carbon acid is the best substrate-analog inactivator known to date for pdhc, more potent than either fluoropyruvate or bromopyruvate. the following conclusions were drawn from extensive studies with pdhc: (a) the kinetics of inactivation of pdh complexes and of resolved e1 by 2-oxo-3-alkynoic  acids is time- and concentration-dependent. (b) the 4-carbon acid has a ki 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the 5-carbon acid, clearly demonstrating the substrate specificity of pdhc. (c) the rate of inactivation of pdh complexes and  of resolved e1 by 2-oxo-3-alkynoic acids is enhanced by the addition of thdp and  mgcl2. (d) pyruvate completely protects e1 and partially protects pdhc from inactivation by 2-oxo-3-butynoic acid. (e) e1 but not e2-e3 is the target of inactivation by 2-oxo-3-butynoic acid. (f) inactivation of e1 by 2-oxo-3-butynoic acid is accompanied by modification of 1.3 cysteines/e1 monomer. the order of reactivity with the 4-carbon acid was pdhc > pox > pdc. while the order of reactivity with pdhc and pox was 2-oxo-3-butynoic acid > 2-oxo-3-pentynoic acid > 2-oxo-3-heptynoic acid, the order of reactivity was reversed with pdc.

TI  == sequence analysis and characterization of pom1, a small cryptic plasmid from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for butyrivibrios.
AB  == as a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. we present here the complete nucleotide sequence of butyrivibrio plasmid pom1, which was isolated from b. fibrisolvens bu49. while it is very similar in size to the previously characterized butyrivibrio plasmids prjf1 and prjf2, pom1 exhibits a restriction pattern which  is quite distinct. analysis of sequence data reveals that pom1 contains only two  open reading frames of significant length (orf1 and orf2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. the protein encoded in orf1 shows  homologies with pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, lactobacillus plantarum, and bacillus thuringiensis. the putative translation product of orf2, on the other hand, resembles rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the staphylococcus plasmid psn2 is a prototype. unlike the other characterized-butyrivibrio plasmids, pom1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pom1 has been used in the construction of a new escherichia coli-b. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, psmerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into b. fibrisolvens harboring the prjf1 plasmid.

AB  == a cluster of citrulline biosynthetic genes has been cloned and sequenced from a fragment of lactobacillus plantarum ccm 1904 (atcc 8014) dna isolated as complementing a bacillus subtilis argf mutation. the gene order was cara-argcjbdf, with cara transcribed divergently from the arg cluster. although other gram-positive bacteria show similar arg clusters, this arrangement for cara is thus far unprecedented. downstream from the arg cluster, two open reading frames (orf7 and orf8) having unknown functions were found. sequence analysis of  the end of a 10.5-kb cloned dna fragment showed that argf was 3.5 kb from the ldhl gene coding for l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase. a tree representation of amino  acid sequence clustering relationships of 31 ornithine carbamoyltransferases (otcases) from various organisms revealed two prokaryotic groups: one with argf of l. plantarum and one with argf of b. subtilis, which are paralogous. this divergence was not observed in vivo because an l. plantarum argf mutant (am 1215) harboring no otcase activity was complemented by the argf genes of l. plantarum and b. subtilis. no otcase activity was detectable when l. plantarum was grown in the presence of saturating amounts of arginine or citrulline. arginine may repress the citrulline biosynthetic genes in l. plantarum by using 11 identified  dna motifs which resemble the escherichia coli arg box consensus and which are in most cases separated by multiples of 11 bp, corresponding to a dna helical turn.  the cara and argcjbdf genes are divergently transcribed. their putative promoters are 6 bp apart and are partially overlapped by putative arg boxes, suggesting concerted transcription regulation.

TI  == effects of the kinetics of water potential variation on bacteria viability.
AB  == the effect of the kinetics of water potential variation (psi) on the viability of bacteria subjected to hyperosmotic stresses in water-glycerol solution was studied. the three bacteria used were lactobacillus plantarum l-73, leuconostoc mesenteroides lm057 and escherichia coli tg1. these strains were submitted to a final water potential of -107.2 mpa, -170.9 mpa and/or -244.7 mpa. in any case the kinetics of water potential variation was found to have a great effect on the cell viability. the application of slow water potential decreases could maintain  an important cell viability (about 80-100%) with regard to the corresponding viability observed after a sudden step change for the same final water potential  (15-57%). for each strain tested, an optimal dehydration kinetics was determined  which depended on the final water potential. the existence of this optimum could  be explained thanks to the opposition of two actions affecting cell viability: a  positive action relative to the slowness of the water potential variation and a negative action relative to the residence time of cells in a critical range of water potential.

AB  == mice with null mutations in cytokine or t cell receptor (tcr) genes develop intestinal inflammation. in the case of interleukin-2-/- and interleukin-10-/- mice it has been demonstrated that normal intestinal bacterial flora can cause gut pathology. tcr-alpha-/- mice not only develop colitis but also produce a strong antibody response to self-antigens, such as double-stranded dna. it is therefore important to establish whether the intestinal inflammation develops spontaneously or is induced by luminal antigens. to address this issue, a germ-free colony of tcr-alpha-/- mice was derived and compared with tcr-alpha-/-  mice kept in conventional specific-pathogen-free conditions. although specific-pathogen-free animals developed colitis with a high level of penetrance, there was no evidence of intestinal pathology in germ-free animals. furthermore,  intestinal inflammation was not seen in tcr-alpha-/- mice colonized with a limited bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, and/or escherichia coli. we conclude that intestinal inflammation in tcr-alpha-/- mice does not occur spontaneously nor does it result from the presence of bacteria, per se, but rather it is initiated by a specific organism or group of organisms normally present in the gut flora that have yet to be identified.

AB  == this report describes the sequence and structural organisation of the pyrimidine  biosynthesis pathway genes of lactobacillus plantarum ccm 1904. it also describes an in vitro technique based on pcr for sequencing without cloning. this new technique was developed because it was impossible to clone certain parts of the l. plantarum genomic dna in the escherichia coli host. l. plantarum pyr genes are organised as a 9.8-kb operon with the following order: pyrr, pyrb, pyrc, pyraa, pyrab, pyrd, pyrf and pyre. there are two major differences from the pyrimidine operons of bacillus subtilis (quinn et al., j. bacteriol. 266 (1991) 9113-9127; turner et al., j. bacteriol, 176 (1994) 3708-3722) and bacillus caldolyticus (ghim et al., microbiology 140 (1994) 479-491): the absence of pyrp encoding for  uracil permease, and the absence of an open reading frame named orf2, whose function is unknown. two mutually exclusive stem-loop structures were predicted at the 5'-end of l. plantarum pyr mrna; this operon could be regulated by transcriptional attenuation under the control of pyrr. complementation of e. coli pyrd, pyrf and pyre mutants was obtained with a l. plantarum genomic dna library. alignment of the l. plantarum pyr proteins with other known procaryotic pyr proteins indicates that they display highly conserved regions in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == two lactobacillus plantarum strains of human intestinal origin, strains 299 (= dsm 6595) and 299v (= dsm 9843), have proved to be efficient colonizers of the human intestine under experimental conditions. these strains and 17 other l. plantarum strains were tested for the ability to adhere to cells of the human colonic cell line ht-29.l.plantarum 299 and 299v and nine other l. plantarum strains, including all six strains that belong to the same genetic subgroup as l. plantarum 299 and 299v, adhered to ht-29 cells in a manner that could be inhibited by methyl-alpha-d-mannoside. the ability to adhere to ht-29 cells correlated with an ability to agglutinate cells of saccharomyces cerevisiae and erythrocytes in a mannose-sensitive manner and with adherence to d-mannose-coated agarose beads. l. plantarum 299 and 299v adhered to freshly isolated human colonic and ileal enterocytes, but the binding was not significantly inhibited by methyl-alpha-d-mannoside. periodate treatment of ht-29 cells abolished mannose-sensitive adherence, confirming that the cell-bound receptor was of carbohydrate nature. proteinase k treatment of the bacteria also abolished adherence, indicating that the binding involved protein structures on the bacterial cell surface. thus, a mannose-specific adhesin has been identified in l. plantarum; this adhesin could be involved in the ability to colonize the intestine.

AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == utilization of fermented flocculated poultry sludge as a feed constituent for pigs.
AB  == flocculated poultry sludge was mixed with 3% molasses and was flow-therm pasteurized for 5 min at a core temperature of 95 c. the sludge was subsequently  cooled to between 20 and 25 c and fermented with lactobacillus plantarum as starter culture. three groups of eight 8- to 10-wk-old, individually housed fattening pigs (hypor) were fed according to a fixed scheme correlated with age.  one control group received a restricted ration of commercial compound feed (group a). the other control group was provided "nearly ad libitum" access to the same commercial compound feed (group c). the experimental group received the same amount of commercial compound feed as group a, but the diet was supplemented with fermented sludge, at an inclusion rate of 19 to 28% of the total ration (dm basis). the pigs fed the sludge-containing diet and those receiving the compound  pig feed "nearly ad libitum" showed comparable growth results. it was concluded that the net energy (nepig) level of .68 g dm of sludge was comparable to the nepig level of 1 g compound pig feed (88% dm). a decrease in colony counts of enterobacteriaceae in the intestinal tract of the pigs, was regarded as positive, as it might lower the risk of disturbance of the gut flora by enteropathogenic bacteria such as escherichia coli and salmonella. no adverse effects on health and performance were observed as a result of the feeding of pasteurized and subsequently fermented flocculated poultry sludge to fattening pigs. it is concluded that this sludge can serve as a valuable feed constituent as long as it is processed properly.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a conjugated bile acid hydrolase gene from clostridium perfringens.
AB  == the gene encoding a conjugated bile acid hydrolase (cbah) from clostridium perfringens 13 has been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence analyses indicated that the gene product is related to two previously characterized amidases, a cbah from lactobacillus plantarum (40% identity) and a  penicillin v amidase from bacillus sphaericus (34% identity). the product is apparently unrelated to a cbah from c. perfringens for which n-terminal sequence  information was determined. the gene product was purified from recombinant e. coli and used to raise antibody in rabbits. the presence of the protein in c. perfringens was then confirmed by immunoblot analysis. the protein was shown to have a native molecular weight of 147,000 and a subunit molecular weight of 36,100, indicating its probable existence as a tetramer. disruption of the chromosomal c. perfringens cbah gene with a chloramphenicol resistance cartridge  resulted in a mutant strain which retained partial cbah activity. polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis followed by enzymatic activity staining and immunoblotting indicated that the mutant strain no longer expressed the cloned cbah (cbah-1) but did express at least one additional cbah (cbah-2). cbah-2 was immunologically distinct from cbah-1, and its mobility on native polyacrylamide gels was different from that of cbah-1. furthermore, comparisons of ph optima and substrate specificities of cbah activities from recombinant e. coli and wild-type and mutant c. perfringens provided further evidence for the presence of multiple  cbah activities in c. perfringens.

AB  == two lactobacillus-escherichia coli shuttle vectors, harbouring the levanase gene  from bacillus subtilis under the control of its own promoter (plpew1) or behind the e. coli tac promoter (pesiew2), were constructed. lactobacillus plantarum showed the same growth characteristics on selective plates and in liquid media containing inulin, after transformation with either plpew1 or pesiew2. l. plantarum transformed with plpew1 could be selected on inulin plates, indicating  that levanase expression can be used as a food-grade selection system for lactobacillus. lactobacillus casei grew faster in inulin-containing medium than l. plantarum after transformation with pesiew2, but did not grow when harbouring  plpew1. inulin-degrading activities of 90 mu/ml were found in culture medium of l. plantarum containing plpew1 or pesiew2, and of 500 mu/ml in medium of l. casei (pesiew2). addition of 1 mm isopropyl beta-d-thiogalactoside to the culture medium had no effect on growth and levanase expression in l. plantarum (pesiew2)  and l. casei (pesiew2) strains. levanase produced by l. casei (pesiew2) has a size of 75 kda and 72 kda, corresponding to that of unprocessed and mature b. subtilis levanase, respectively, suggesting that the protein produced is recognized and processed by a signal peptidase.

TI  == studies on bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus isolates from selected nigerian fermented foods.
AB  == ten bacteriocin-producing (bacteriocinogenic) lactobacillus isolates obtained from three nigerian fermented foods namely: kenkey, ogi and wara were tested against the following indicator organisms: lactobacillus plantarum and food borne pathogens comprising enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, serratia, pseudomonas, vibrio cholerae, aeromonas sobria, aeromonas cavice, salmonella typhimurium, plesiomonas shigelloides and staphylococcus aureus. all the bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus were found to inhibit l. plantarum while some inhibited some of the food borne pathogens listed above. the antimicrobial activities of bacteriocins from l. plantarum kky12 and l. casei ogm12 were caused by proteins detectable in the culture liquids. they are designated plantacin n and caseicin a and they have narrow antimicrobial spectra. plantacin n from l. plantarum kky12 was active against l. plantarum, pseudomonas, aeromonas sobria and aeromonas cavice whereas caseicin a from l. casei ogm12 inhibited l. plantarum, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and vibrio cholerae. caseicin a is stable at 121 degrees c/15 mins, and both are inactivated by proteolytic enzymes. the bacteriocinogenic properties of the local isolates of lactobacillus can help to reduce hygienic risk and the spoilage of fermented foods.

AB  == recombinant plasmids containing the pediococcus acidilactici l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase gene (ldhl) were isolated by complementing for growth under anaerobiosis of an escherichia coli lactate dehydrogenase-pyruvate formate lyase  double mutant. the nucleotide sequence of the ldhl gene predicted a protein of 323 amino acids showing significant similarity with other bacterial l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenases and especially with that of lactobacillus plantarum. the ldhl transcription start points in p. acidilactici were defined by primer extension, and the promoter sequence was identified as tcaat-(17 bp)-tataat. this sequence is closely related to the consensus sequence of vegetative promoters from gram-positive bacteria as well as from e. coli. northern analysis of p. acidilactici rna showed a 1.1-kb ldhl transcript whose abundance is growth rate regulated. these data, together with the presence of a putative rho-independent transcriptional terminator, suggest that ldhl is expressed as a monocistronic transcript in p. acidilactici.

TI  == permeabilization of mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes for in situ hybridization with fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == the application of whole-cell hybridization using labelled oligonucleotide probes in microbial systematics and ecology is limited by difficulties in permeabilizing many gram-positive organisms. in this investigation paraformaldehyde treatment, acid methanolysis and acid hydrolysis were evaluated as a means of permeabilizing mycolic-acid-containing actinomycetes prior to hybridization with a fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probe designed to bind to a conserved sequence of bacterial 16s rrna. methods were evaluated on stationary-phase cultures of gordona bronchialis, mycobacterium fortuitum, nocardia asteroides, n. brasiliensis, rhodococcus equi, r. erythropolis, r. fascians, r. rhodochrous and  tsukamurella paurometabola, none of which could be probed following 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixation. for comparison and to test the general applicability of mild acid pretreatments, bacillus subtilis, lactobacillus plantarum, escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida were also studied. the data showed that most of the mycolic-acid-containing organisms were successfully permeabilized by  mild acid hydrolysis in 1 m hcl at 37 degrees c. cells were treated for different lengths of time. in general, the mycolic-acid-containing organisms required between 30 and 50 min hydrolysis, whereas b. subtilis, e. coli and p. putida were rendered permeable in only 10 min. interestingly, l. plantarum could not be permeabilized using acid hydrolysis even after 60 min exposure to 1 m hcl.

TI  == divergence in codon usage of lactobacillus species.
AB  == we have analyzed codon usage patterns of 70 sequenced genes from different lactobacillus species. codon usage in lactobacilli is highly biased. both inter-species and intra-species heterogeneity of codon usage bias was observed. codon usage in l. acidophilus is similar to that in l. helveticus, but dissimilar to that in l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. pentosus and l. plantarum. codon usage in  the latter three organisms is not significantly different, but is different from  that in l. bulgaricus. inter-species differences in codon usage can, at least in  part, be explained by differences in mutational drift. l. bulgaricus shows gc drift, whereas all other species show at drift. l. acidophilus and l. helveticus  rarely use nng in family-box (a set of synonymous) codons, in contrast to all other species. this result may be explained by assuming that l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, but not other species examined, use a single trna species for translation of family-box codons. differences in expression level of genes are positively correlated with codon usage bias. highly expressed genes show highly biased codon usage, whereas weakly expressed genes show much less biased codon usage. codon usage patterns at the 5'-end of lactobacillus genes is not significantly different from that of entire genes. the gc content of codons 2-6 is significantly reduced compared with that of the remainder of the gene. the possible implications of a reduced gc content for the control of translation efficiency are discussed.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum ldhl gene: overexpression and deletion.
AB  == lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that converts pyruvate to l-(+)- and d-(-)-lactate with stereospecific enzymes designated l-(+)- and d-(-)-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), respectively. a gene (designated ldhl) that encodes l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase from l. plantarum dg301 was cloned by complementation in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of the ldhl gene predicted a protein of 320 amino acids closely related to that of lactobacillus pentosus. a multicopy plasmid bearing the ldhl gene without modification of its expression signals was introduced in l. plantarum. l-ldh activity was increased up to 13-fold through this gene dosage effect. however, this change had hardly any effect on the production of l-(+)- and d-(-)-lactate. a stable chromosomal deletion in the ldhl gene was then constructed in l. plantarum by a two-step homologous recombination process. inactivation of the gene resulted in the absence of l-ldh activity and in exclusive production of the d isomer of lactate. however, the global concentration of lactate in the culture supernatant remained  unchanged.

AB  == broiler by-products (heads, feet, and viscera) mixed with 4% dextrose were pasteurized for 4 min at 90 degrees c core temperature, cooled to 20 degrees c, and fermented with lactobacillus plantarum as starter culture. these fermented poultry by-products were fed to 12 individually housed fattening pigs as part (17.6% of the dry matter) of their fattening ration, the remainder composed of compound pig feed. control pigs received a compound pig feed only. both groups of pigs were fed restrictively on the basis of body weight. the technical results of the pigs fed the experimental diet showed a significantly improved feed:gain ratio (2.46 vs 2.57), a significantly higher carcass weight (86.1 vs 81.8 kg), a  lower meat percentage (50.9 vs 52.5%) and an increased backfat thickness (21.5 vs 18.7%). the bacterial flora in the intestinal tract of the pigs fed the experimental diet differed significantly from the control animals. decreased colony counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, enterococci and lactobacilli were found in the rectal content and the prevalence of salmonella was lower. it is suggested that the improved feed:gain ratio and the reduced bacterial activity of the measured groups of bacteria is a result of 1) the higher energy content of the diet, and(or) 2) an assumed enhanced digestibility of nutritional components in the diet, and(or) 3) the lower incidence of diarrhea in the pigs fed with fermented poultry by-products. this resulted in a lower contamination level of enteropathogenic bacteria like, salmonella and escherichia coli, in the gastro-intestinal tract of the pigs fed fermented poultry by-products.

TI  == histidine 296 is essential for the catalysis in lactobacillus plantarum d-lactate dehydrogenase.
AB  == two his residues, his-205 and his-296, in lactobacillus plantarum d-lactate dehydrogenase are highly conserved in the d-isomer-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, suggesting that they are candidates for the catalytic his in the enzyme. the substitution of his-296 with tyr by means of site-directed mutagenesis induced a drastic decrease in the reaction rate, while a his-205 to tyr substitution induced no large change in the catalytic properties. in pyruvate reduction, the tyr-296 enzyme showed a slightly increased km below ph 6.0 but no  significant ph dependence above ph 6.0, where the wild-type enzyme showed an increased km value. in d-lactate oxidation, in contrast, the tyr-296 enzyme showed a greatly increased km value for d-lactate and strong ph dependence. an additional substitution of his-296 with gln induced more complete loss of the catalytic activity. in contrast to the tyr-296 enzyme, the gln-296 enzyme showed  a greatly increased km value and a strong ph-dependent reaction rate even in pyruvate reduction. unlike the wild-type or his-205 enzyme, both the tyr-296 and  gln-296 enzymes showed significant resistance against diethyl pyrocarbonate. these results clearly indicate that his-296 is essential for the catalysis by d-lactate dehydrogenase, as in the case of his-195 in l-lactate dehydrogenase.

AB  == lactobacillus plantarum a112 has four different plasmids. plus-origin-specific probes were used to determine that the smallest, cryptic plasmid, pa1 (2,820 bp), showed homology to the pe194 plasmid family. this subclass of plasmids uses the rolling-circle mode of replication. subsequent analysis of plasmid pa1 demonstrated that it generates single-stranded dna intermediates, and sequence analysis revealed that it contains three putative open reading frames (orfs): orf1, orf2, and orf3, which could encode proteins designated repa (47 amino acids [aa]) and repb (196 aa) and a protein of 103 aa, respectively. two of these proteins, repa (5.6 kda) and repb (26 kda), were identified in in vitro transcription translation assays. the repa protein contains a characteristic alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix motif typical of dna-binding proteins that act as dna-binding repressors. the repb protein shows a significant similarity with replication initiation proteins of the pe194 family of plasmids that use the rolling-circle mode of replication. plasmid pa1 is able to replicate in escherichia coli and lactobacillus lactis subsp. lactis as well as in other l. plantarum strains.

(1992) j. biol. chem. 267, 8499-8513], a 0.6-kbp dna fragment was amplified from l. helveticus genomic dna by the polymerase chain reaction. this amplified dna fragment was used as a probe to identify two recombinant clones containing the d-lactate dehydrogenase gene. both plasmids overexpressed d-lactate dehydrogenase (greater than 60% total soluble cell protein) and were stable in escherichia coli, compared to plasmids carrying the l. bulgaricus and lactobacillus plantarum genes. the entire nucleotide sequence of the l. helveticus d-lactate dehydrogenase gene was determined. the deduced amino acid sequence indicated a polypeptide consisting of 336 amino acid residues, which showed significant amino acid sequence similarity to the recently identified family of d-2-hydroxy-acid dehydrogenases [kochhar, s., hunziker, p. e., leong-morgenthaler, p. & hottinger, h. (1992) biochem. biophys. res. commun. 184, 60-66]. the physicochemical and catalytic properties of recombinant d-lactate dehydrogenase were identical to those of the wild-type enzyme, e.g. alpha 2 dimeric subunit structure, isoelectric ph, km and kcat for pyruvate and other 2-oxo-acid substrates. the kinetic profiles of 2-oxo-acid substrates showed some  marked differences from that of l-lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting different mechanisms for substrate binding and specificity.

AB  == the gene encoding d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-lactate: nad+ oxidoreductase, ec 1.1.1.28) of lactobacillus plantarum has been sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli cells with an inducible expression plasmid, in which the 5'-noncoding region of the gene was replaced with the tac promoter. comparison of the sequence of d-lactate dehydrogenase with l-lactate dehydrogenases, including  the l. plantarum l-lactate dehydrogenase, showed no significant homology. in contrast, the d-lactate dehydrogenase is homologous to e. coli d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and lactobacillus casei d-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. this indicates that d-lactate dehydrogenase is a member of a new family of 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases recently proposed, being distinct from l-lactate dehydrogenase and l-malate dehydrogenase, and strongly suggests that the new family consists of d-isomer-stereospecific enzymes. in the reductive reaction, the enzyme showed a broad substrate specificity, although pyruvate was  the most favorable of all 2-ketocarboxylic acids tested. in particular, hydroxypyruvate is effectively reduced by the enzyme, the reaction rate, and km value being comparable to those in the case of pyruvate, indicating that the enzyme has not only d-lactate dehydrogenase activity but also d-glycerate dehydrogenase activity. the conserved residues in this family appear to be the residues involved in the substrate binding and the catalytic reaction, and thus to be targets for site-directed mutagenesis.

TI  == incompatibility of lactobacillus vectors with replicons derived from small cryptic lactobacillus plasmids and segregational instability of the introduced vectors.
AB  == three new lactobacillus vectors based on cryptic lactobacillus plasmids were constructed. the shuttle vector plp3537 consists of a 2.3-kb plasmid from lactobacillus pentosus md353, an erythromycin resistance gene from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pe194, and puc19 as a replicon for escherichia coli. the vectors plpe317 and plpe323, which do not contain e. coli sequences, were generated by introducing the erythromycin resistance gene of pe194 into a 1.7- and a 2.3-kb plasmid from l. pentosus md353, respectively. these vectors and the shuttle vector plp825 (m. posno, r. j. leer, j. m. m. van rijn, b. c. lokman, and p. h. pouwels, p. 397-401, in a. t. ganesan and j. a. hoch, ed., genetics and biotechnology of bacilli, vol. 2, 1988) could be introduced by electroporation into lactobacillus casei, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis strains with similar efficiencies. transformation efficiencies were strain dependent and varied from 10 to 10 transformants per mug of dna. plasmid dna analysis of l. pentosus md353 transformants revealed that the introduction of plp3537 or plpe323 was invariably accompanied by loss of the endogenous 2.3-kb plasmid. remarkably, plpe317 could only be introduced into an l. pentosus md353 strain that had been previously cured of its endogenous 1.7-kb  plasmid. the curing phenomena are most likely to be explained by the incompatibility of the vectors and resident plasmids. lactobacillus vectors are generally rapidly lost when cells are cultivated in the absence of selective pressure. however, plpe323 is stable in three of four lactobacillus strains tested so far.

TI  == the occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  == minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees c) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the ph of the mix to 4.5-4.7. significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of staphylococcus warneri, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis. micrococcus varians and micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. less growth was exhibited by bacillus megaterium and yeasts. pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (p. pentosaceus and l. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. the growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. inoculated escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella sofia, and staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. lesser growth occurred for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with p. acidilactici.

TI  == secretion of tem beta-lactamase with signal sequences isolated from the chromosome of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis.
AB  == with tem beta-lactamase as a reporter gene, a set of expression-secretion-promoting fragments were isolated from the chromosome of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis. the fact that only translocated beta-lactamase  renders cells resistant to ampicillin allowed direct ampicillin selection with an escherichia coli vector (pkth33). the clones showing the greatest ampicillin resistance were subcloned onto a replicon capable of replication in lactic acid bacteria (pvs2), and the nucleotide sequences of the relevant fragments were determined. the structure of the secretion-promoting fragments in general resembled that of gram-positive true signal sequences, with a strongly positively charged n terminus, a long hydrophobic core, and a putative signal peptidase recognition site. the promoterlike sequences preceding the signal sequences matched well with those of previously published lactococcal promoters. in addition to e. coli, the functioning of these expression-secretion cassettes was  studied in three gram-positive hosts: bacillus subtilis, l. lactis, and lactobacillus plantarum. efficient expression and secretion of tem beta-lactamase into the culture medium of each gram-positive host was obtained. furthermore, when a strain of l. lactis subsp. lactis showing increased sensitivity to lysozyme was compared with a standard laboratory strain, threefold-higher secreted enzyme activities were detected.

AB  == the replication region of a 28-kilobase-pair (kbp) cryptic plasmid from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis ssd207 was cloned in l. lactis subsp. lactis mg1614 by using the chloramphenicol resistance gene from the streptococcal plasmid pgb301 as a selectable marker. the resulting 8.1-kbp plasmid, designated pvs34, was characterized further with respect to host range,  potential cloning sites, and location of replication gene(s). in addition to lactococci, pvs34 transformed lactobacillus plantarum and, at a very low frequency, staphylococcus aureus but not escherichia coli or bacillus subtilis. the 4.1-kbp clai fragment representing lactococcal dna in pvs34 contained unique  restriction sites for hindiii, ecori, xhoii, and hpaii, of which the last three could be used for molecular cloning. a region necessary for replication was located within a 2.5-kbp fragment flanked by the ecori and clai restriction sites. a 3.8-kbp ecori fragment derived from a nisin resistance plasmid, psf01, was cloned into the ecori site of pvs34 to obtain a nisin-chloramphenicol double-resistance plasmid, pvs39. from this plasmid, the streptococcal chloramphenicol resistance region was subsequently eliminated. the resulting plasmid, pvs40, contains only lactococcal dna. potential uses for this type of a  nisin resistance plasmid are discussed.

TI  == characterization, cloning, curing, and distribution in lactic acid bacteria of plp1, a plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum ccm 1904 and its use in shuttle vector construction.
AB  == a small 2.1-kb plasmid called plp1 was extracted from lactobacillus plantarum ccm 1904 (atcc 8014) and cloned into the escherichia coli puc19 plasmid. as determined by dna-dna southern hybridization with a plp1-radioactively labeled probe, other lactic acid bacteria such as l. curvatus, l. sake, carnobacterium, and leuconostoc mesenteroides harbor plp1-related plasmids. shuttle vectors based on the plp1 replicon were constructed by inserting the erythromycin-resistance gene from pva891 into the various puc19-plp1 constructions. plp1-based shuttle vector transformation efficiencies (te) by electroporation were compared to te of a broad-host-range plasmid pgk12 in different lactobacilli strains. expression of the puc19-plp1 plasmids in escherichia coli maxicells showed that plp1 encodes for a 37,000 mw protein which can act in trans allowing the replication of plasmids in which this protein is truncated. the plp1-based shuttle vectors producing this protein replicate in lactobacilli and also in bacillus subtilis. a plp1-free strain was obtained by incompatibility with a plp1-based shuttle vector introduced in l. plantarum ccm 1904 by electroporation. the absence of plp1 has no incidence on the strain phenotype suggesting that plp1 is not essential for the strain in our laboratory conditions.

TI  == structural organization of plp1, a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum ccm 1904.
AB  == to construct shuttle vectors based on an endogenous replicon, we isolated a small cryptic plasmid (plp1) from lactobacillus plantarum ccm 1904. the nucleotide sequence (2093 bp, 38.25 gc mol%) revealed one major open reading frame encoding  for a 317 amino acid protein (rep). comparisons with proteins encoded by other gram-positive bacteria plasmids strongly suggest that the protein encoded by plp1 has a replicative role. the presence of a consensus sequence including a tyrosine residue known to be the replication protein binding site to the dna (in phage phi x174) strengthens this hypothesis. the dna sequence contains also a sequence similar to the pc194 origin nick sequence, which initiates the plasmid replication at the plus origin, characteristic of plasmids which replicate following a rolling circle mechanism via single-stranded dna intermediates. a set of 13 direct repeats of 17 bp could be involved in the expression of the incompatibility or in the copy number control as in the other plasmids. a promoter sequence located at the rep 5' region has been identified and is functional in bacillus subtilis.

TI  == integration and expression of alpha-amylase and endoglucanase genes in the lactobacillus plantarum chromosome.
AB  == a commercial grass silage starter strain of lactobacillus plantarum was transformed by high-frequency electroporation with plasmids containing an alpha-amylase gene from bacillus stearothermophilus and an endoglucanase gene from clostridium thermocellum. both genes were expressed from their native regulatory signals, and active enzymes were found in the supernatant. however, the segregational stability of the transforming plasmids was rather low. therefore, the transforming genes were inserted in the l. plantarum chromosome by means of single homologous recombination. in the majority of the transformants, this led to extremely stable segregation and expression of the transforming genes, without generating secondary mutations in the host. increased selective pressure led to tandem amplification of the transforming dna. the transformed strains demonstrated the ability of l. plantarum to express heterologous gene products; they can be used to detect the inoculum in silage ecology studies; and  they demonstrate the feasibility of engineering truly cellulolytic silage starter bacteria.

TI  == photoaffinity labeling of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase with a farnesyl pyrophosphate analogue.
AB  == the prenyl transferase undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase was partially purified from the cytosolic fraction of escherichia coli. its enzymic products were characterized as a family of cis-polyprenyl phosphates, which ranged in carbon number from c55 to c25. the enzyme is constituted of two subunits of approximately 30,000 molecular weight. a radiolabeled photolabile analogue of t,t-farnesyl pyrophosphate, [3h]2-diazo-3-trifluoropropionyloxy geranyl pyrophosphate, was shown to label lactobacillus plantarum and e. coli undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase on uv irradiation in the presence of isopentenyl pyrophosphate and divalent cation. the only labeled polypeptide migrated on electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel at a molecular weight of approximately 30,000. no protein was radiolabeled when the natural substrate, t,t-farnesyl pyrophosphate was included in the irradiation mixture. irradiation in the presence of mgcl2 without isopentenyl pyrophosphate gave less labeling of the polypeptide. irradiation with only isopentenyl pyrophosphate gave little labeling of the polypeptide. when the enzyme was irradiated with 3h-photoprobe, [14c]isopentenyl pyrophosphate, and mgcl2, the labeled polypeptide gave a ratio of 14c/3h that indicated the product must also bind to the enzyme on irradiation. these results demonstrate the ability to radiolabel the allylic pyrophosphate binding site and possibly product binding site of undecaprenyl pyrophosphate synthetase by a process which is favored when  both cosubstrate and divalent cation are present.

TI  == manganese, superoxide dismutase, and oxygen tolerance in some lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a previous study of the aerotolerant bacterium lactobacillus plantarum, which lacks superoxide dismutase (sod), demonstrated that it possesses a novel substitute for this defensive enzyme. thus, l. plantarum contains 20 to 25 mm mn(ii),m in a dialyzable form, which is able to scavenge o2- apparently as effectively as do the micromolar levels of sod present in most other organisms. this report describes a survey of the lactic acid bacteria. the substitution of millimolar levels of mn(ii) for micromolar levels of sod is a common occurrence in this group of microorganisms, which contained either sod or high levels of mn(ii), but not both. two strains were found which had neither high levels of mn(ii) nor sod, and they were, as was expected, very oxygen intolerant. lactic acid bacteria containing sod grew better aerobically than anaerobically, whereas  the organisms containing mn(ii) in place of sod showed aerobic growth which was best, at best, equal to anaerobic growth. plumbagin (5-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone) increases the rate of o2- production in these organisms. lactobacillus strains containing high intracellular mn(ii) were  more resistant to the oxygen-dependent toxicity of plumbagin than were strains containing lower levels of mn(ii). the results support the conclusion that a high internal level of mn(ii) provides these organisms with an important defence against endogenous o2-.

(1966) biochem. biophys. res. commun. 25, 662-669). we have demonstrated the presence of five pantothenate-containing compounds in l. plantarum which have been identified by co-chromatography with authentic samples: pantothenate, 4'-phosphopantetheine, 3'-dephosphocoenzyme a, coenzyme a, and acyl carrier protein (acp). the concentrations of the above pantothenate-containing compounds were found to be: 0.009, 0.13, 0.067, 0.69, and 0.22 nmol/mg of protein, respectively. l. plantarum acp was shown to have a molecular weight near that of escherichia coli acp but to have a lower isoelectric point (pi = 3.75). oleate in the presence of triton x-100 was found to reduce the concentration of acp by 80% with little effect on the concentrations of the other pantothenate-containing compounds. the synthesis of acp apparently ceased soon after the addition of oleate and the rate of decrease in concentration of acp was quanitatively consistent with the previously observed rate of decrease in the initial rate of fatty acid biosynthesis in this organism (weeks, g., and wakil, s.j. (1970) j. biol. chem. 245, 1913-1921). thus, the change in rate of fatty acid biosynthesis in l. plantarum upon addition of oleate to the medium can be quantitatively related to the concentration of acp (and probably to the concentration of co-repressible enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis).

AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activities of some chloro analogs of 3 amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril.
AB  == the effects of a chloro substituent upon the microbiological activities of 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril were determined. the 5-, 6-, and 7-chloro analogs were synthesized by reductive cyclizations of the appropriately  chloro-substituted o-nitrophenylalanines, while the 8-chloro analog was obtained  from the n-trifluoroacetyl-3-chloro-2-nitrophenylalanine ethyl ester. all of these compounds were observed to inhibit the growth of escherichia coli 9723, leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and lactobacillus plantarum 8014. the relative inhibitory activities of the chloro analogs were 7-cl greater than 6-cl greater than 8-cl greater than 5-cl in e. coli and 7-cl greater than 6-cl greater than 8-cl = 5-cl in l. dextranicum and l. plantarum. in each of the three microorganisms, the 7-cl analog was a more effective growth inhibitor than the parent unsubstituted compound. the growth inhibitory activities of this class of  compounds were demonstrated to be much more effective than those of the four corresponding lactams, the 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-chloro analogs of 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril.

TI  == the relationship between nitro group reduction and the intestinal microflora.
AB  == the capacity of rats to reduce a 25-mg dose of p-nitrobenzoic acid (pnba) was measured by quantifying the amount of this compound recovered in the urine as p-aminobenzoic acid (paba) and its conjugates. it was found that germfree rats converted approximately 1% of pnba to paba; in conventional rats the conversion was approximately 25%. various bacteria isolated from the rat cecum were selectively associated with germfree rats and it was demonstrated that these bacteria colonized their gastrointestinal tracts. in assoication with lactobacillus plantarum, the conversion of pnba to paba increased to 3.9%. when these rats were further associated with clostridium sp. and streptoccocus faecalis, the conversion increased to approximately 12%. a general correlation was found between the capacity of constituents of the microflora to reduce pnba in vitro and when associated with the germfree rat. cecectomy, which removes a substantial portion of the microflora of the rat, decreases the capacity of the conventional rat to reduce pnba. similar experiments with p-nitrobenzenesulfonamide indicate that this compound is also largely reduced by  the flora. evidence that the reduction of the nitro group in these compounds is carried out by the intestinal microflora explains previous observations in which  the reduction of these compounds in rats did not correlate with the activity of liver enzymes putative for these reactions.

TI  == analysis of bacterial biotin-proteins.
AB  == the biotin-protein populations in several bacterial strains were analyzed by solubilization of [3h]biotin-labeled cells with sodium dodecylsulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent. a variety of patterns of biotin-labeled polypeptide chains was seen, ranging from a single biotin-protein in escherichia coli, corresponding to the biotin carboxyl carrier  protein component of acetyl-coa carboxylase, to multiple species in enterobacter  aerogenes, pseudomonas citronellolis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium shermanii, lactobacillus plantarum, and mycobacterium phlei, which probably represent subunits of multiple biotin-dependent enzymes present in these organisms. in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two major biotin-containing polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 65 000 and 25 000 were shown to correspond to the biotin carboxyl carrier components of pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-coa carboxylase, respectively. thus in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two different biotin-dependent enzymes in the same cell do not share common biotin carboxyl carrier subunits.

TI  == synthesis and microbiological activities of some monohalogenated analogs of tyrosine.
AB  == 2-chlorotyrosine and 2-bromotyrosine, as well as the previously reported 2-fluorotyrosine, were synthesized by hydrolysis of the condensation products from the appropriate benzyl bromide and ethyl acetamidomalonate and were compared with the corresponding 3-halotyrosines as growth inhibitors of escherichia coli 9723, streptococcus faecalis 8043 and lactobacillus plantarum 8014. in contrast to the 2- and 3-fluorotyrosines which were equally effective as growth inhibitors, the 2-chloro- and 2-bromotyrosines were much more effective than the  3-chloro- and 3-bromotyrosines in inhibiting the growth of the three microorganisms. for each of the assay organisms, the growth inhibitions of all three 2-halotyrosines were reversed competitively in varying degrees by tyrosine.

TI  == evidence against the presence of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate and relevant enzymes in lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == analysis of cells of lactobacillus plantarum, starved or undergoing induction, showed no 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp). neither adenyl cyclase nor 3', 5'-camp phosphodiesterase was detected in extracts. extracts of l. plantarum did not inhibit these two enzymes of escherichia coli k-12, strain w1435. incubation of adenosine triphosphate (atp)-u-(14)c with cells or various cell-free fractions of l. plantarum did not produce labeled 3', 5'-camp. of various 3', 5'-cyclic and acyclic nucleotides tested, only 3', 5'-camp, atp, and  yeast adenylic acid stimulated l-arabinose isomerase. yeast adenylic acid was two to four times as effective as 3', 5'-camp or atp. 2', 3'-camp was not effective.

TI  == microbial destruction by low concentrations of hypochlorite and iodophor germicides in alkaline and acidified water.
AB  == hypochlorite and iodophor germicides were evaluated for their ability to destroy  a variety of organisms at levels approximating those used for final sanitizing rinse for dairy and food equipment and beverage bottles (3 to 50 ppm). test organisms included escherichia coli, streptococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus cerevisiae, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the hypochlorites and iodophors demonstrated approximate rates of destruction at equivalent concentrations for the bacterial species tested, except where the hypochlorite contained excess alkalinity. the hypochlorite responded more readily to a downward shift to a ph of 5.0 than did the iodophor. excess alkalinity of the hypochlorite significantly affected its bactericidal activity. the iodophor exhibited a consistently greater rate of destruction of yeast cells than the hypochlorite. successive treatment with low levels of iodophor (6 ppm) followed by a hypochlorite (12 to 25 ppm) resulted in a high level of destruction of all test organisms. possibilities for employing these measures in a sanitizing rinse  of bottles for maximal destruction of organisms were discussed. among the test organisms, s. lactis showed a comparatively high resistance and was a useful organism for comparing the halogen preparations.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the cyanide-resistant and azide-resistant catalase of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == johnston, m. a. (cornell university, ithaca, n.y.), and e. a. delwiche. isolation and characterization of the cyanide-resistant and azide-resistant catalase of lactobacillus plantarum. j. bacteriol. 90:352-356. 1965.-lactobacillus plantarum  t-1403-5 has been shown to possess a very active cyanide- and azide-resistant catalase. by means of fractional ammonium sulfate precipitation, removal of nucleic acids with protamine sulfate, adsorption on calcium phosphate gel, and ph gradient chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, the catalase "activity" was purified approximately 14-fold. the purified enzyme preparation was insensitive to the heme poisons cyanide and azide, the metal chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetate and o-phenanthroline, and the sulfhydryl binding agent p-chloromercuribenzoate. the purified enzyme moved at a uniform rate in the electrophoretic field (isoelectric point, ph 4.7). the ultraviolet-light absorption spectrum was negative for heme-iron components, and fluorescence measurements yielded negative results with regard to flavin components. acriflavin and atabrine had no effect on enzyme activity. the nonheme catalase displayed a much broader ph range of activity than the heme-iron catalase of a control culture of escherichia coli and the azide-sensitive catalase developed by l. plantarum nz48 when grown in the presence of preformed hematin. the nonheme catalase was more resistant to heat inactivation. no retention of the enzyme on a chromatographic column could be obtained with sephadex 200, nor could the enzyme  be separated from crystalline beef-liver catalase by the gel filtration technique. sedimentation was obtained in a centrifugal field of 144,000 x g for 12 hr.

TI  == distribution and characteristics of the catalases of lactobacillaceae.
AB  == johnston, m. a. (cornell university, ithaca, n.y.), and e. a. delwiche. distribution and characteristics of the catalases of lactobacillaceae. j. bacteriol. 90:347-351. 1965.-certain strains of lactobacilli and pediococci incorporated hematin during growth, with the concomitant formation of cyanide- and azide-sensitive catalase. three of five strains of lactobacilli and five of 25 strains of pediococci were capable of this biosynthesis. the pediococci required the heme component of blood, whereas the lactobacilli could incorporate  the heme component in the form of purified and solubilized hemin or from blood. in all cases where inhibitor-sensitive enzyme was produced, it was accompanied by the production of inhibitor-insensitive enzyme. in the absence of hematin, only insensitive enzyme was obtained. two catalase-positive strains of streptococcus faecalis were found incapable of the synthesis of a heme-type enzyme, as was one  member of the genus leuconostoc. iron and manganese in the growth medium stimulated the production of the insensitive catalase, but significant quantities of these metals could not be found in a purified enzyme preparation obtained from lactobacillus plantarum. aeration had little or no effect on growth, but it consistently doubled the amount of cyanide- and azide-resistant catalase. by means of conventional enzyme fractionation techniques, it was possible to separate the two different enzymes present in the cell-free extract of a strain of pediococcus homari which had been grown in the presence of blood.

(north carolina state of the university of north carolina, raleigh), j. j. mcneill, and s. b. tove. biotin deficiency and the fatty acids of certain biotin-requiring bacteria. j. bacteriol. 88:389-394. 1964.-the major fatty acids  of lactobacillus plantarum were identified as myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, cis-vaccenic, and lactobacillic. small amounts of a c(14)-monoenoic acid were also found. the major acids of a biotin-requiring mutant of escherichia coli were lauric, myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, methylene-hexadecanoic, octadecenoic, and methylene-octadecanoic. the c(16)-monoenoic acid fraction of e. coli also contained small amounts of 7,8-hexadecenoate. the c(18)-monoenoic acid  fraction contained 9,10-octadecenoic acid (oleic), with small amounts of 7,8-octadecenoic. two other components, which had properties similar to tridecanoic and pentadecanoic acids, were also found. biotin deficiency in l. plantarum decreased the relative amounts of cis-vaccenic and lactobacillic acids, and increased palmitic acid. in e. coli there was no change in the proportion of  palmitic acid, whereas there were increases in monoenoic acids and a decreased level of methylene-hexadecanoic acid. in l. plantarum, palmitic and lactobacillic acids increased with age, and cis-vaccenic decreased sharply. in biotin deficiency, there was a decrease of about 20% in total lipid of l. plantarum.

TI  == inhibition on bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid.
AB  == streightoff, frank (the lilly research laboratories, indianapolis, ind.). inhibition of bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid. j. bacteriol. 85:42-48. 1963.-several compounds related to 5-fluoronicotinic acid (5-fna) have been demonstrated to inhibit streptococcus sp. (viridans group), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus  plantarum in vitro. the most active compounds were 5-fna and 5-fluoronicotinamide (5-fnam). the growth of streptococcus sp. was inhibited more than 50% by 0.05 mug/ml of 5-fna or 0.5 mug/ml of 5-fnam. the inhibition of streptococcus sp. from 1 part of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 4 and 2 parts of nicotinic acid, respectively. the inhibition of e. coli from 100 parts of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 1 part of nicotinic acid. inhibitions by most other active compounds  could be reversed by nicotinic acid. in experiments with mice, eight compounds related to 5-fna had activity against streptococcus pyogenes; 5-fna, 5-fnam, and  5-fluoro-n-dimethylaminomethylnicotinamide protected all mice at 83 mg/kg x two treatments subcutaneously. the action of 200 mg/kg x two treatments of 5-fna was  reversed by 20 mg/kg x two treatments of nicotinic acid. the activity of 5-fna was not increased by modifications at the number 3 or 5 positions on the pyridine ring or by any other structural changes.
