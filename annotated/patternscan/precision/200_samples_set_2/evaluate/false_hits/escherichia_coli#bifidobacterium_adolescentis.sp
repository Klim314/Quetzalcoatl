TI  == graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of b. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens e. coli and s. aureus.
AB  == the impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. the gut microbiota has been known to play a  crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a  potential new territory for drug targeting. herein, graphene oxide (go) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, b. adolescentis, l. acidophilus, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus, was studied. it was shown that, in bacterial media, go sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of b. adolescentis against the pathogens e. coli ands. aureus. data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16s rrna gene sequencing consistently indicated that go sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for b. adolescentis. scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and  that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with go sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of go. these results suggest the possibility of using go sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.

TI  == competitive inhibition of adherence of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, enteropathogenic escherichia coli and clostridium difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo by purified adhesin of bifidobacterium adolescentis 1027.
AB  == aim: to observe competitive inhibition of adherence of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) and clostridium difficile (c. difficile) to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo by purified adhesin of bifidobacterium adolescentis 1027 (b. ado 1027). methods: the binding  of bacteria to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo was counted by adhesion assay. the inhibition of adherence of etec, epec and c. difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo by purified adhesin of b. ado 1027 was evaluated quantitatively by flow cytometry. results: the purified adhesin at the concentration of 10 microg/ml, 20 microg/ml and 30 microg/ml except at 1 microg/ml and 5 microg/ml could inhibit significantly the adhesion of etec, epec  and c. difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo. moreover, we observed that a reduction in bacterial adhesion was occurred with increase in the concentration of adhesin, and mfi (mean fluorescent intensity) was decreased with increase in the concentration of adhesin. conclusion: the purified adhesin of b.  ado 1027 can inhibit the adhesion of etec, epec and c. difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line lovo in a dose-dependent manner.

TI  == cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
AB  == the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.

TI  == [the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == [the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  == the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under  study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
