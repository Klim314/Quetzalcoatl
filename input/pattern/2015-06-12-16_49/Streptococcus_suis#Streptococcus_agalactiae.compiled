TI  - Recombination between Streptococcus suis ICESsu32457 and Streptococcus agalactiae ICESa2603 yields a hybrid ICE transferable to Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements that reside in the chromosome but retain the ability to undergo excision and to transfer by conjugation. Genes involved in drug resistance, virulence, or niche adaptation are often found among backbone genes as cargo DNA. We recently characterized in Streptococcus suis an ICE (ICESsu32457) carrying resistance genes [tet(O/W/32/O), tet(40), erm(B), aphA, and aadE] in the 15K unstable genetic element, which is flanked by two approximately 1.3kb direct repeats. Remarkably, approximately 1.3-kb sequences are conserved in ICESa2603 of Streptococcus agalactiae 2603V/R, which carry heavy metal resistance genes cadC/cadA and mer. In matings between S. suis 32457 (donor) and S. agalactiae 2603V/R (recipient), transconjugants were obtained. PCR experiments, PFGE, and sequence analysis of transconjugants demonstrated a tandem array between ICESsu32457 and ICESa2603. Matings between tandem array-containing S. agalactiae 2603V/R (donor) and Streptococcus pyogenes RF12 (recipient) yielded a single transconjugant containing a hybrid ICE, here named ICESa2603/ICESsu32457. The hybrid formed by recombination of the left approximately 1.3-kb sequence of ICESsu32457 and the approximately 1.3-kb sequence of ICESa2603. Interestingly, the hybrid ICE was transferable between S. pyogenes strains, thus demonstrating that it behaves as a conventional ICE. These findings suggest that both tandem arrays and hybrid ICEs may contribute to the evolution of antibiotic resistance in streptococci, creating novel mobile elements capable of disseminating new combinations of antibiotic resistance genes.
TI  - Transduction of the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage Phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(A) and tet(O), to other Streptococcus species.
AB  - Phim46.1 - Streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(A) and tet(O), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (M phenotype) and tetracycline - is widespread in S. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. Phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among S. pyogenes isolates, but no information is available about its transferability to other Streptococcus species. We thus investigated Phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of different Streptococcus species. Transductants were obtained from recipients of Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gordonii, and Streptococcus suis. Retransfer was always achieved, and from S. suis to S. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. In transductants Phim46.1 retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin C, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. The transductants shared the same Phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved RNA uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. No transfer occurred to recipients of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. A largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. Growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of Phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, and S. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in S. suis. The S. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene atl.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Group B Streptococcus and Streptococcus suis capsular polysaccharides induce chemokine production by dendritic cells via Toll-like receptor 2- and MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways.
AB  - Streptococcus agalactiae (also known as group B Streptococcus [GBS]) and Streptococcus suis are encapsulated streptococci causing severe septicemia and meningitis. Bacterial capsular polysaccharides (CPSs) are poorly immunogenic, but anti-CPS antibodies are essential to the host defense against encapsulated bacteria. The mechanisms underlying anti-CPS antibody responses are not fully elucidated, but the biochemistry of CPSs, particularly the presence of sialic acid, may have an immunosuppressive effect. We investigated the ability of highly purified S. suis and GBS native (sialylated) CPSs to activate dendritic cells (DCs), which are crucial actors in the initiation of humoral immunity. The influence of CPS biochemistry was studied using CPSs extracted from different serotypes within these two streptococcal species, as well as desialylated CPSs. No interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-12p70, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or IL-10 production was observed in S. suis or GBS CPS-stimulated DCs. Moreover, these CPSs exerted immunosuppressive effects on DC activation, as a diminution of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-induced B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF) expression was observed in CPS-pretreated cells. However, S. suis and GBS CPSs induced significant production of CCL3, via partially Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)- and myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathways, and CCL2, via TLR-independent mechanisms. No major influence of CPS biochemistry was observed on the capacity to induce chemokine production by DCs, indicating that DCs respond to these CPSs in a patterned way rather than a structure-dedicated manner.
TI  - Novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GrAS]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases. They are among the many Gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. As a result, alternative therapies need to be developed to combat these pathogens. We have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (PlySs2), derived from a Streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA), Streptococcus suis, Listeria, Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus [GBS]), S. pyogenes, Streptococcus sanguinis, group G streptococci (GGS), group E streptococci (GES), and Streptococcus pneumoniae. PlySs2 has an N-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (CHAP) catalytic domain and a C-terminal SH3b binding domain. It is stable at 50 degrees C for 30 min, 37 degrees C for >24 h, 4 degrees C for 15 days, and -80 degrees C for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. PlySs2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced MRSA and S. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a MIC of 16 mug/ml for MRSA. A single, 2-mg dose of PlySs2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice in a bacteremia model of mixed MRSA and S. pyogenes infection. Serially increasing exposure of MRSA and S. pyogenes to PlySs2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to PlySs2 and resistance to mupirocin. To date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, PlySs2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.
TI  - Common regulators of virulence in streptococci.
AB  - Streptococcal species are a diverse group of bacteria which can be found in animals and humans. Their interactions with host organisms can vary from commensal to pathogenic. Many of the pathogenic species are causative agents of severe, invasive infections in their hosts, accounting for a high burden of morbidity and mortality, associated with high economic costs in industry and health care. Among them, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus suis are discussed here. An environmentally stimulated and tightly controlled expression of their virulence factors is of utmost importance for their pathogenic potential. Thus, the most universal and widespread regulators from the classes of stand-alone transcriptional regulators, two-component signal transduction systems (TCS), eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinases, and small noncoding RNAs are the topic of this chapter. The regulatory levels are reviewed with respect to function, activity, and their role in pathogenesis. Understanding of and interfering with transcriptional regulation mechanisms and networks is a promising basis for the development of novel anti-infective therapies.
TI  - Interspecies mobilization of an ermT-carrying plasmid of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis by a coresident ICE of the ICESa2603 family.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The recently documented presence of almost identical, small, non-self-transmissible, erm(T)-carrying plasmids in clonally unrelated erythromycin-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae suggests that these plasmids somehow circulate in the streptococcal population. The objective of this study was to characterize the erm(T)-carrying genetic element in a clinical isolate of Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (Sde5580) and to provide a possible explanation for the spread of erm(T)-carrying plasmids in streptococci. METHODS: The erm(T)-carrying element of Sde5580 was investigated by plasmid analysis, PCR experiments and sequencing. Transfer and retransfer experiments were performed using S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and Streptococcus suis strains as recipients and by selection in the presence of suitable drug concentrations. Transconjugants were analysed by SmaI-macrorestriction analysis. Genetic studies also included PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using HindIII endonuclease. RESULTS: Sde5580 contained two mobile genetic elements: a 4950 bp erm(T)-carrying plasmid (p5580) almost identical to the non-self-transmissible erm(T)-carrying plasmids of S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae mentioned above, and an ~63 kb cadC/cadA-carrying integrative and conjugative element (ICESde3396-like) of the ICESa2603 family. p5580 was transferable at high frequency to the recipients of all three species through in trans mobilization by the coresident ICESde3396-like element. p5580 and ICESde3396-like were able to be transferred either separately or together. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence of horizontal transfer of an erm(T)-carrying plasmid between streptococci. In trans mobilization by coresident ICEs may be one mechanism for the spread of erm(T)-carrying plasmids in the streptococcal population.
TI  - Development of a single-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for detection of four pathogens of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Several loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays have been developed  to detect common causative pathogens of bacterial meningitis (BM). However, no LAMP assay is reported to detect Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis, which are also among common pathogens of BM. Moreover, it is laborious and expensive by performing multiple reactions for each sample to detect bacterial pathogen. Thus, we aimed to design and develop a single-tube LAMP assay capable of detecting multiple bacterial species, based on the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA genes of main pathogens involved in BM were aligned to identify conserved regions, which were further used to design broad range specific LAMP assay primers. We successfully designed a set of broad range specific LAMP assay primers for simultaneous detection of four species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. suis and S. agalactiae. The broad range LAMP assay was highly specific without cross-reactivity with other bacteria including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and Escherichia coli. The sensitivity of our LAMP assay was 100-1000 times higher compared with the conventional PCR assay. The bacterial species could be identified after digestion of the LAMP products with restriction endonuclease DdeI and HaeIII.
TI  - Characterization of a Streptococcus suis tet(O/W/32/O)-carrying element transferable to major streptococcal pathogens.
AB  - Mosaic tetracycline resistance determinants are a recently discovered class of hybrids of ribosomal protection tet genes. They may show different patterns of mosaicism, but their final size has remained unaltered. Initially thought to be confined to a small group of anaerobic bacteria, mosaic tet genes were then found to be widespread. In the genus Streptococcus, a mosaic tet gene [tet(O/W/32/O)] was first discovered in Streptococcus suis, an emerging drug-resistant pig and human pathogen. In this study, we report the molecular characterization of a tet(O/W/32/O) gene-carrying mobile element from an S. suis isolate. tet(O/W/32/O) was detected, in tandem with tet(40), in a circular 14,741-bp genetic element (39.1% G+C; 17 open reading frames [ORFs] identified). The novel element, which we designated 15K, also carried the macrolide resistance determinant erm(B) and an aminoglycoside resistance four-gene cluster including aadE (streptomycin) and aphA (kanamycin). 15K appeared to be an unstable genetic element that, in the absence of recombinases, is capable of undergoing spontaneous excision under standard growth conditions. In the integrated form, 15K was found inside a 54,879-bp integrative and conjugative element (ICE) (50.5% G+C; 55 ORFs), which we designated ICESsu32457. An approximately 1.3-kb segment that apparently served as the att site for excision of the unstable 15K element was identified. The novel ICE was transferable at high frequency to recipients from pathogenic Streptococcus species (S. suis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae), suggesting that the multiresistance 15K element can successfully spread within streptococcal populations.
TI  - Fhb, a novel factor H-binding surface protein, contributes to the antiphagocytic  ability and virulence of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a Gram-positive bacterium that causes sepsis and meningitis in piglets and humans. The mechanisms of S. suis serotype 2 invasive disease are not well understood. The surface proteins of pathogens usually play important roles in infection and bacterium-host interactions. Here, we identified a novel surface protein that contributed significantly to the virulence of S. suis serotype 2 in a piglet infection model. This protein showed little similarity to other reported proteins and exhibited strong binding activity to human factor H (hFH). It was designated Fhb (factor H-binding protein). The fhb genes found in S. suis serotypes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9 exhibited molecular polymorphism. Fhb possessed two proline-rich repeat sequences and XPZ domains, and one repeat sequence exhibited a high homology to Bac, an IgA-binding protein of Streptococcus agalactiae. Evidence strongly indicated that fhb-deficient mutants had diminished phagocytosis resistance in bactericidal assays. In addition, Fhb plays important roles in complement-mediated immunity by interacting with hFH. These findings indicated that Fhb is a crucial surface protein contributing to the virulence of S. suis, with important functions in evading innate immune defenses by interaction with host complement regulatory factor hFH.
TI  - Fisher scientific award lecture - the capsular polysaccharides of Group B Streptococcus and Streptococcus suis differently modulate bacterial interactions with dendritic cells.
AB  - Infections with encapsulated bacteria cause serious clinical problems. Besides being poorly immunogenic, the bacterial capsular polysaccharide (CPS) cloaks antigenic proteins, allowing bacterial evasion of the host immune system. Despite the clinical significance of bacterial CPS and its suggested role in the pathogenesis of the infection, the mechanisms underlying innate and, critically, adaptive immune responses to encapsulated bacteria have not been fully elucidated. As such, we became interested in studying the CPS of two similar, but unique, streptococcal species: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Streptococcus suis . Both streptococci are well encapsulated, some capsular types are more virulent than others, and they can cause severe meningitis and septicemia. For both pathogens, the CPS is considered the major virulence factor. Finally, these two streptococci are the sole Gram-positive bacteria possessing sialic acid in their capsules. GBS type III is a leading cause of neonatal invasive infections. Streptococcus suis type 2 is an important swine and emerging zoonotic pathogen in humans. We recently characterized the S. suis type 2 CPS. It shares common structural elements with GBS, but sialic acid is alpha2,6-linked to galactose rather than alpha2,3-linked. Differential sialic acid expression by pathogens might result in modulation of immune cell activation and, consequently, may affect the immuno-pathogenesis of these bacterial infections. Here, we review and compare the interactions of these two sialylated encapsulated bacteria with dendritic cells, known as the most potent antigen-presenting cells linking innate and adaptive immunity. We further address differences between dendritic cells and professional phagocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils, in their interplay with these encapsulated pathogens. Elucidation of the molecular and cellular basis of the impact of CPS composition on bacterial interactions with immune cells is critical for mechanistic understanding of anti-CPS responses. Knowledge generated will help to advance the development of novel, more effective anti-CPS vaccines and improved immunotherapies.
TI  - Streptococcus suis, an Emerging Drug-Resistant Animal and Human Pathogen.
AB  - Streptococcus suis, a major porcine pathogen, has been receiving growing attention not only for its role in severe and increasingly reported infections in humans, but also for its involvement in drug resistance. Recent studies and the analysis of sequenced genomes have been providing important insights into the S. suis resistome, and have resulted in the identification of resistance determinants for tetracyclines, macrolides, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, antifolate drugs, streptothricin, and cadmium salts. Resistance gene-carrying genetic elements described so far include integrative and conjugative elements, transposons, genomic islands, phages, and chimeric elements. Some of these elements are similar to those reported in major streptococcal pathogens such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus agalactiae and share the same chromosomal insertion sites. The available information strongly suggests that S. suis is an important antibiotic resistance reservoir that can contribute to the spread of resistance genes to the above-mentioned streptococci. S. suis is thus a paradigmatic example of possible intersections between animal and human resistomes.
TI  - Structure determination of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharide.
AB  - The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 was isolated,  purified, chemically modified, and characterized. Sugar and absolute configuration analyses of the CPS gave the following composition: D-Gal, 3; D-Glc, 1; D-GlcNAc, 1; D-Neu5Ac, 1; L-Rha, 1. Sialic acid was found to be terminal, and the CPS was quantitatively desialylated by mild acid hydrolysis. The CPS was also submitted to periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction and Smith degradation. Sugar and methylation analysis, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry of the native CPS or of its specifically modified products allowed to determine the repeating unit sequence: [4)[Neu5Ac(alpha2-6)Gal(beta1-4)GlcNAc(beta1-3)]Gal(beta1-4)[Gal(alpha1-3)]Rha(be ta1-4)Glc(beta1-]n. The backbone sequence was found to be identical to that of Streptococcus agalactiae or group B Streptococcus (GBS) type VIII and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 23F. The S. suis CPS shares the sequence Neu5Ac-Gal-GlcNAc-Gal in common with GBS types Ia, Ib, II, III, and IV CPSs but differs from them by the presence of rhamnose and the fact that sialic acid is 2,6- rather than 2,3-linked to the following Gal. A correlation between the S. suis CPS sequence and genes of the serotype 2 cps locus encoding putative enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the repeating unit was tentatively established.
TI  - The changing faces of Streptococcus antigen I/II polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans antigen I/II (AgI/II) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in Gram-positive bacteria. It mediates attachment of S. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. The AgI/II family polypeptides recognize salivary glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation, tissue invasion and immune modulation. The genes encoding AgI/II family polypeptides are found among Streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. suis. Evidence of functionalities for different regions of the AgI/II proteins has emerged. A sequence motif within the C-terminal portion of Streptococcus gordonii SspB (AgI/II) is bound by Porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. The significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. A new picture emerges of the central V (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench, being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an N-terminal alpha-helix and a C-terminal polyproline helix. This presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other Gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.
TI  - Identification and characterization of Streptococcus agalactiae isolates using 16S rRNA sequencing and cellular fatty acid composition analysis.
AB  - This study was undertaken to apply 16S rRNA sequence and Cellular Fatty Acid (CFA) composition analysis techniques for the identification and characterization of seven individual bacteria isolates obtained from seven infected fish samples. All samples were cultured on brain heart infusion agar. All the seven isolates were Gram positive and were identified as Streptococcus sp. The 16S rRNA sequencing method yielded about 1500 bps for each strain where upon the sequence was compared to nucleotide data in Gene Bank using BLASTN 2.2.1 sequence alignment from NCBI for the nucleotide comparison. The 16S rRNA gene sequence for all the seven samples had no sequence variation between the isolates and gave a 100% similarity to plus, plus strand with Streptococcus agalactiae strain A909 Accession number NC_007432.1 and S. agalactiae strain H36B (Accession number AAJS01000007). Also the 16S rRNA sequence showed a high (92-93%) similarity between S. agalactiae and S. equi, S. suis and S. uberis. All strains appeared to be nearly identical to each other after CFA analysis using Library Generation System (LGS) software (MIDI) and were consistent to that of S. agalactiae ATCC 12386, the CFA analysis not only confirmed the results of 16S rRNA sequence but also indicated a possibility of single source of infection. Despite their accuracy to identify the poorly described, rarely isolated, or phenotypically aberrant strains, 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and CFA analysis lacks widespread use beyond the large and reference laboratories because of technical and cost considerations.
TI  - The cell envelope subtilisin-like proteinase is a virulence determinant for Streptococcus suis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a major swine pathogen and zoonotic agent that  mainly causes septicemia, meningitis, and endocarditis. It has recently been suggested that proteinases produced by S. suis (serotype 2) are potential virulence determinants. In the present study, we screened a S. suis mutant library created by the insertion of Tn917 transposon in order to isolate a mutant deficient in a cell surface proteinase. We characterized the gene and assessed the proteinase for its potential as a virulence factor. RESULTS: Two mutants (G6G and M3G) possessing a single Tn917 insertion were isolated. The affected gene coded for a protein (SSU0757) that shared a high degree of identity with Streptococccus thermophilus PrtS (95.9%) and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus agalactiae CspA (49.5%), which are cell surface serine proteinases. The SSU0757 protein had a calculated molecular mass of 169.6 kDa and contained the catalytic triad characteristic of subtilisin family proteinases: motif I (Asp200), motif II (His239), and motif III (Ser568). SSU0757 also had the Gram-positive cell wall anchoring motif (Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly) at the carboxy-terminus, which was followed by a hydrophobic domain. All the S. suis isolates tested, which belonged to different serotypes, possessed the gene encoding the SSU0757 protein. The two mutants devoid of subtilisin-like proteinase activity had longer generation times and were more susceptible to killing by whole blood than the wild-type parent strain P1/7. The virulence of the G6G and M3G mutants was compared to the wild-type strain in the CD1 mouse model. Significant differences in mortality rates were noted between the P1/7 group and the M3G and G6G groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In summary, we identified a gene coding for a cell surface subtilisin-like serine proteinase that is widely distributed in S. suis. Evidences were brought for the involvement of this proteinase in S. suis virulence.
TI  - Screening of binding activity of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus suis to berries and juices.
AB  - Antiadhesion therapy is a promising approach to the fight against pathogens. Antibiotic resistance and the lack of effective vaccines have increased the search for new methods to prevent infectious diseases. Previous studies have shown the antiadhesion activity of juice from cultivated cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) against bacteria, especially E. coli. In this study, the binding of two streptococcal strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, to molecular size fractions (FI, FII and FIII, <10 kDa, 10-100 kDa, and >100 kDa, respectively) of berries and berry and fruit juices from 12 plant species were studied using a microtiter well assay. For Streptococcus suis a hemagglutination inhibition assay was used. In general, binding activity was detected especially to wild cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos L.) and to other Vaccinium species. S. pneumoniae cells bound most to cranberry juice fraction FI and S. agalactiae cells to cranberry fraction FIII. Hemagglutination induced by S. suis was most effectively inhibited by cranberry fraction FII. NMR spectra of some characteristic active and non-active fractions were also measured. They indicate that fractions FII and FIII contained proanthocyanidins and/or other phenolic compounds. The results suggest Vaccinium berries as possible sources of antiadhesives against bacterial infections.
TI  - [The emergence of candidate pathogenicity island 89K DNA sequence of Streptococcus suis isolated from sporadic patients in Zhejiang province].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the presence of candidate pathogenicity island 89K DNA sequence of Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) strains isolated from patient in Zhejiang province. METHODS: Genes and DNA fragments were amplified by PCR, using specific primers, and three amplified fragments of the 89K sequence were directly sequenced. The results were analyzed using software related to bioinformatics and epidemiology. RESULTS: 8 strains of SS2 all contained 89K sequence, cps2J and mrp virulent genes, and species-specific 16S rDNA. 3 amplified fragments of 89K candidate pathogenicity island of SS2 ZJ0501 were above 99% similar to SS2 strain identified from outbreaks in Jiangsu in 1998, and the gene fragment of coding DNA recombinant protein in the 89K sequence was highly homological with that of S. dysgalactiae and S.agalactiae. CONCLUSION: In recent years SS2 strains isolated from patients with clinical symptoms in Zhejiang province had been detected to have contained candidate pathogenic 89K DNA fragment.
TI  - [Antibiotics susceptibility of Streptococcus and Enterococcus: data of Onerba network].
AB  - This work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae), or in animals (Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Data were recorded since 1996 through the Onerba networks. S. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in S. pyogenes. In 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. A similar trend was observed for S. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals S. suis and S. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. In enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. Indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in E. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of E. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. From 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in French hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. However, the recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in French hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. Such trend in macrolide resistance among S. pyogenes or S. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.
TI  - Evolution of the core and pan-genome of Streptococcus: positive selection, recombination, and genome composition.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The genus Streptococcus is one of the most diverse and important human and agricultural pathogens. This study employs comparative evolutionary analyses of 26 Streptococcus genomes to yield an improved understanding of the relative roles of recombination and positive selection in pathogen adaptation to their hosts. RESULTS: Streptococcus genomes exhibit extreme levels of evolutionary plasticity, with high levels of gene gain and loss during species and strain evolution. S. agalactiae has a large pan-genome, with little recombination in its core-genome, while S. pyogenes has a smaller pan-genome and much more recombination of its core-genome, perhaps reflecting the greater habitat, and gene pool, diversity for S. agalactiae compared to S. pyogenes. Core-genome recombination was evident in all lineages (18% to 37% of the core-genome judged to be recombinant), while positive selection was mainly observed during species differentiation (from 11% to 34% of the core-genome). Positive selection pressure was unevenly distributed across lineages and biochemical main role categories. S. suis was the lineage with the greatest level of positive selection pressure, the largest number of unique loci selected, and the largest amount of gene gain and loss. CONCLUSION: Recombination is an important evolutionary force in shaping Streptococcus genomes, not only in the acquisition of significant portions of the genome as lineage specific loci, but also in facilitating rapid evolution of the core-genome. Positive selection, although undoubtedly a slower process, has nonetheless played an important role in adaptation of the core-genome of different Streptococcus species to different hosts.
TI  - [Evaluation of Prolex for the rapid identification of streptococci isolated in medical microbiology].
AB  - The need to rapidly identify streptococci responsible for acute infectious diseases has led to the development of agglutination techniques that are able to identify streptococcal group antigens (A, B, C, D, F, and G) directly from primoculture colonies on blood agar. The Prolex agglutination tests (Pro-Lab Diagnostics, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada), distributed in France by i2a, have been used for the determination of group antigens of 166 isolates of streptococci and enterococci previously identified in the National Reference Center for Streptococci. The results obtained with the Prolex reagents have permitted to correctly identify all pyogenic beta-hemolytic streptococci (23 Streptococcus pyogenes, 21 Streptococcus agalactiae, 33 Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis including 6 group C and 27 group G, and 5 Streptococcus porcinus including 4 group B). Four differences between unexpected agglutinations (A or F) and species identifications have been obtained. These differences were observed for four non-hemolytic isolates of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus infantarius, and Streptococcus suis. The anti-D reagent has been of value as a marker for isolates of enterococci. Thus, these results confirm the abilities of these agglutination tests for the grouping of beta-hemolytic streptococci. Moreover, the use of Prolex has the advantage to be rapid because of the non-enzymatic but chemical extraction of streptococcal antigens.
TI  - Simple and rapid PCR method for identification of streptococcal species relevant  to animal infections based on 23S rDNA sequence.
AB  - A PCR identification system targeting 23S rDNA sequences for the identification of eight streptococcal species relevant to animal infections (Streptococcus agalactiae, S. bovis, S. canis, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi, S. porcinus, S. suis and S. uberis) was developed. This system consists of two PCR reactions, A and B, in which seven and eight primers, respectively, are used simultaneously, and was designed so that each amplification product indicates a species by its size. A total of 111 cultures, including the type strain of eight species, could be successfully identified and differentiated as individual species, except for the cross reactivity between S. bovis and S. equinus. The developed PCR system can complete the identification procedure for eight streptococcal species through two tube reactions per isolate, and, therefore, might provide a rapid, simple and accurate diagnostic tool for veterinary laboratories.
TI  - [Antimicrobial action of ammonium salts of fused heterocycles containing ortho-nitrogen].
AB  - By alkylation of hexamethylenetetramine with halogenated derivatives of ketones,  ethers, esters or amides of acids, alkyl- and aralkyl halides the corresponding N-monoalkylated compounds of hexamethylenetetramine were obtained. The quaternization of pyridine nitrogen in 5,6-benzoquinoline, 8-hydroxyquinoline, quinoline, 1,10-phenanthroline molecules with alkyl- or aralkylhalides was carried out. The susceptibility of Gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli, Salmonella cholerae suis, Salmonella enteridis Gartneri) microorganisms to synthesized quaternary ammonium salts by disc difussion method has been detected. The bacteriostatic action of 0.5-1% solutions of all compounds was assessed in comparison with benzalkonium chloride. It was shown, that the most effectiveness against all strains is possessed by quaternary hexamethylenetetramine ammonium salts, and especially salts, containing 1-propynyl- or hydroxycarbamoylmethyl radicals. The action of these two compounds against Salmonella and Streptococcus was stronger than the action of benzalkonium chloride. Susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to these compounds were detected. It was shown, that 1% solutions of chlorides of N-(1-propynyl) hexamethylenetetramonium and N-(hydroxycarbamoylmethyl) hexamethylenetetrammonium demonstrate the same bacteriostatic action against P. aeruginosa as well as benzalkonium chloride.
TI  - Production and properties of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from the swine pathogen Streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  - Streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a major pathogen found in the upper respiratory  tract of swine. In this study, isolates of this bacterial species were tested for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). Of the 38 strains tested, four inhibited the growth of other S. suis isolates according to a deferred-antagonism plate assay. Interestingly, three of the strains were originally isolated from healthy carrier pigs and were considered nonvirulent. Three isolates (94-623, 90-1330, and AAH4) that produced BLIS in liquid broth were selected for further characterization. None of the inhibitory activities was related to the production of either organic acids or hydrogen peroxide. The BLIS produced by these strains were heat stable and proteinase K, pronase, and elastase sensitive but were trypsin and chymotrypsin resistant. They were stable at pH 2 and 12 and had molecular masses in the range of 14 to 30 kDa. Maximum production was observed during the mid-log phase. Following a curing procedure with novobiocin, only 90-1330 lost the ability to produce BLIS, suggesting that the BLIS might be plasmid encoded. Analysis of the inhibitory spectra revealed that the BLIS-producing strains also inhibited the growth of Actinobacillus minor, Actinobacillus porcinus, Enterococcus durans, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. This study reports for the first time the ability of the swine pathogen S. suis serotype 2 to produce BLIS with the characteristics of classic bacteriocins. Further studies are required to investigate the possibility of using bacteriocin-producing strains to prevent swine infections caused by virulent strains of S. suis serotype 2.
TI  - Inter- and intraspecies variations of the 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region of various streptococcal species.
AB  - The 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer regions (ISR) of different streptococcal species and subspecies were amplified with primers derived from the highly conserved flanking regions of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes. The single sized amplicons showed a uniform pattern for S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup C), S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (serogroup G), S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup L), S. canis, S. phocae, S. uberis, S. parauberis, S. pyogenes and S. equi subsp. equi, respectively. The amplicons of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. porcinus and S. suis appeared with 3, 5 and 3 different sizes, respectively. ISR of selected strains of each species or subspecies investigated were sequenced and multiple aligned. This allowed a separation of ISR into regions, with 7 regions for S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup C), S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis (serogroup G), S. dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (serogroup L), S. canis, S. phocae, S. pyogenes and S. suis, 8 regions for S. uberis and S. parauberis and mostly 9 regions for S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus and S. porcinus. Region 4, encoding the transfer RNA for alanine (tRNA(Ala)), was present and identical for all isolates investigated. The size and sequence of ISR appears to be a unique marker for streptococci of various species and subspecies and could be used for bacterial identification. In addition the size and sequence variations of ISR of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. porcinus and S. suis allows a molecular typing of isolates of these species possibly useful in epidemiological aspects.
TI  - Adult community acquired bacterial meningitis in a Singaporean teaching hospital. A seven-year overview (1993-2000).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to describe the bacteriological, clinical and laboratory features of community acquired bacterial meningitis in adults admitted to a Singapore tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis admitted between 1993 and 2000 were identified by their discharge diagnosis codes. All case records except for 57 which could not be retrieved were retrospectively reviewed. Patients less than 14 years or with skull fractures, post-neurosurgery or with indwelling intracranial devices were excluded. Inclusion criteria was a clinical picture compatible with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis with either (1) positive cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) cultures or latex coagglutination or CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis accompanied by positive blood cultures or (2) in the absence of positive blood cultures, CSF cultures and latex agglutination, presence of CSF pleocytosis of at least 100 neutrophils per microL. RESULTS: Fifteen "culture-positive" and 11 "culture negative" cases were identified. Six (55%) of the "culture-negative" cases received antibiotics prior to admission. Cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in four cases, three cases each of Group B streptococci and Neisseria meningitides. Listeria monocytogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae were each seen twice and Streptococcus suis once. All cases of Group B streptococci occurred in the year 1998. Mortality was 19% (n = 5), six developed infections in other sites, three epileptic seizures, three developed hydrocephalus, and two hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens are similar to those reported in other studies but for an outbreak of Group B Streptococcus in 1998. There were a high number of "culture-negative" cases which may be due to preceding antibiotic intervention.
TI  - Biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  - The Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. Bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the CBD under selected conditions. The biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. Biofilms composed of Arcanobacterium (Actinomyces) pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium renale, or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. Biofilm and planktonic Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. Planktonic Escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. Enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against E. coli growing as a biofilm. Salmonella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. Planktonic and biofilm Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. The CBD provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.
TI  - Genetic bases and medical relevance of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in pathogenic streptococci.
AB  - Many streptococci are human and/or animal pathogens and the frequent cause of life-threatening diseases. Among various streptococcal virulence factors, capsular polysaccharides (CPs) are recognized as essential to prevent phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. In the last decade, an impressive advance on the knowledge of the genetic bases underlying capsule formation has been achieved. The capsular gene cluster driving the formation of the CP of Streptococcus pyogenes and other hyaluronate-producing streptococci, represents one of the simplest cases of gene organization to synthesize a capsule. A more complex situation has been found in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus suis, and other streptococci. On the whole, there exists a direct relationship between the structural and chemical complexity of the repeating unit of the polysaccharide and the number of genes found in the corresponding capsular locus. Streptococcal vaccines, either polysaccharide or conjugate, are currently being tested in clinical trials to overcome the rise of worldwide antibiotic resistance, although, for different reasons, none of these vaccines are expected to provide the required full coverage in a near future. This concern has prompted to explore alternative possibilities with an improved therapeutic potential against streptococcal diseases.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pMV158 family.
AB  - Twenty-two Streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. Fifteen S. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using DNA homology. Ten plasmids were classified within group A and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced S. thermophilus plasmids. Three plasmids (group B) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups C and D). Single-stranded DNA was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups A, C, and D, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. The only plasmid of group C, named pSMQ172, was further characterized. This 4230-bp plasmid replicates in Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. Comparisons with databases showed that pSMQ172 was related to pMV158 of Streptococcus agalactiae and to pSSU1 of Streptococcus suis. These results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.
TI  - Interactions between Streptococcus suis serotype 2 and different epithelial cell  lines.
AB  - Streptococcus suis is an important swine pathogen responsible for cases of sudden death, septicaemia, meningitis, endocarditis and pneumonia. It is also recognized as a zoonotic agent in people occupationally exposed to pigs or pig products. Knowledge on virulence factors of S. suis serotype 2 is limited and the pathogenesis of the infection is poorly understood. It has been suggested that the disease due to S. suis serotype 2 begins with colonization of the nasopharyngeal epithelium, followed by either spread within the respiratory tract or invasion of the bloodstream. The mechanisms involved in the access of bacteria from the bloodstream to the central nervous system are unknown. It is possible that epithelial cells of the choroid plexus also play an important role in the pathogenesis of the meningitis. Different interactions (adhesion, invasion and toxic effects) of S. suis serotype 2 with epithelial cell lines [LLC-PK1, PK(15), A549, HeLa and MDCK] were studied and compared to those of a human pathogen which also causes meningitis, group B Streptococcus (GBS). The results showed that S. suis serotype 2, in contrast to GBS, is able to adhere to but not to invade epithelial cells. The adhesin(s) involved seem(s) to be partially masked by the capsule and are a part of the cell wall. The haemolysin produced by S. suis serotype 2 is responsible for a toxic effect observed on epithelial cells. The results described give additional evidence that pathogenesis of the infection differs between S. suis and GBS. In particular, it is possible that suilysin-positive S. suis strains use adherence and cell injury, as opposed to direct cellular invasion, as part of a complicated multistep process which leads to bacteraemia and meningitis in pigs.
TI  - Streptococcus suis and group B Streptococcus differ in their interactions with murine macrophages.
AB  - Streptococcus suis type 2 and group B Streptococcus type III (GBS) are important  encapsulated bacterial species causing meningitis. In the present study we compared quantitatively the uptake and intracellular survival of S. suis type 2 and GBS type III with murine macrophages in non-opsonic conditions. The role of the capsule of both pathogens was also studied using previously obtained unencapsulated isogenic mutants. Encapsulated S. suis wild-type strain was practically not phagocytosed, while the unencapsulated mutant was easily ingested by macrophages. On the other hand, the well encapsulated GBS strain and its unencapsulated mutant were both phagocytosed in large numbers. Even if S. suis unencapsulated mutant showed a higher uptake rate than the parental strain, this value was always markedly lower than the numbers of ingested GBS strains. In addition, the intracellular survival of encapsulated and unencapsulated GBS strains was significantly higher than that of S. suis strains. These results suggest that interactions between GBS type III and S. suis type 2 with murine macrophages as well as the role of the capsule as an antiphagocytic factor are different for the two bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  - We have used a PCR assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (sodA(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (S. acidominimus, S. agalactiae, S. alactolyticus, S. anginosus, S. bovis, S. constellatus, S. canis, S. cricetus, S. downei, S. dysgalactiae, S. equi subsp. equi, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, S. equinus, S. gordonii, S. iniae, S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. oralis, S. parasanguis, S. pneumoniae, S. porcinus, S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. suis, S. thermophilus, and S. vestibularis). Phylogenetic analysis of these sodA(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16S rRNA sequences. We have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their sodA(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the sodA(int) fragments of the type species. We propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.
TI  - Immunoblot analysis of bacterial polysaccharides: application to the type-specific polysaccharides of Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - A method for the immunoblot analysis of the type-specific capsular polysaccharides of streptococci was developed. The capsular polysaccharides were extracted by sonication and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). After electrophoresis the polysaccharides were transferred to charged PVDF-N membranes and probed with the type specific antibodies. A characteristic ladder-like pattern of polysaccharide bands specific for the serotype (1, 2, 4, 7) was observed for capsular extracts of Streptococcus suis. Human immune sera against type-specific group B streptococcal polysaccharides reacted most strongly with the immunizing polysaccharide type (Ia, II, III). The previously observed crossreactions between the group B streptococcal type-specific capsular preparations were shown to be due to binding to the isomeric polysaccharide molecules. Thus, gel electrophoresis combined with immunoblot analysis seems to provide a novel method for the molecular and immunochemical characterization of bacterial polysaccharides and for the study of the specificity and properties of antibodies to capsular polysaccharides.
TI  - Binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  - Mannan-binding protein (MBP), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. After binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, MBP activates the classical pathway of the complement system. To investigate the binding capacity of MBP to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of MBP to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. Salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), used as a positive control strain, showed binding of radiolabelled MBP at a level of 80% compared with binding of MBP to zymosan. Binding of labelled MBP to Salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. The binding was inhibited by unlabelled MBP, by mannose and by N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of MBP binding capacities could be determined. The encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group A were included: n = 22), N. mucosa (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low MBP binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3-40.1%). Escherichia coli K1 (n = 11), Strep. suis (n = 5), Strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and N. meningitidis serogroup A (n = 2) showed intermediate MBP binding capacity of 58.4% (95% CI 40.0-76.8%). A third group consisting of non-encapsulated Listeria monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated H. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated N. meningitidis (n = 2), N. cinera (n = 1) and N. subflava (n = 1) strains had a high MBP binding capacity of 87.5% (95% CI 62.5-112.5%). The majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low MBP binding capacity.
TI  - Intrageneric structure of Streptococcus based on comparative analysis of small-subunit rRNA sequences.
AB  - The partial 16S rRNA sequences of 24 Streptococcus species were determined by reverse transcription. A comparative analysis of these sequences and the sequences of seven previously studied streptococcal species revealed the presence of several clusters within the genus. The clusters obtained from the sequence analysis agreed in general with the groups outlined on the basis of the results of nucleic acid hybridization studies, but there were some exceptions. The pyogenic group was extended to include Streptococcus agalactiae, S. parauberis, S. porcinus, and S. uberis. Four oral groups were discerned; these four groups centered on S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. anginosus, and S. oralis. Some species (e.g., S. suis and S. acidominimus) did not cluster with any particular group. Our findings are discussed in the context of data from other genetic and chemotaxonomic studies.
TI  - Beta-hemolytic streptococci from pigs: bacteriological diagnosis.
AB  - Beta-hemolytic streptococci from lesions in pigs were identified as S. dysgalactiae biotype "equisimilis" and S. dysgalactiae serovar L, S. porcinus, S. agalactiae, E. faecalis and CO2 dependent and broad beta-hemolytic S. suis. Data are provided which can be used in the interpretation of commercial identification systems. Tests results and physiological characteristics which complete identification procedures using coagglutination tests are proposed and discussed.
TI  - Hemagglutination activities of group B, C, D, and G streptococci: demonstration of novel sugar-specific cell-binding activities in Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A total of 378 streptococcal isolates of Lancefield groups B, C, D and G were tested for their ability to hemagglutinate untreated, sialidase-treated, and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated human erythrocytes. Of the 43 strains showing positive hemagglutination, 9 were inhibitable with neutral monosaccharides. Four strains were inhibited with galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine, whereas five were inhibited with galactose only. A third, sialic acid-specific adhesion activity was suggested for two additional strains on the basis of their agglutination of native and endo-beta-galactosidase-treated but not sialidase-treated erythrocytes. All the sugar-specific agglutination activities detected were confined to Streptococcus suis strains of group D streptococci, whereas streptococci of other groups did not exhibit these types of hemagglutination activities. The adhesins were sensitive to proteases and heat treatment, which indicates that they were proteins. The hemagglutinating isolates of S. suis originated from pig brain and lung, human brain, and the tonsils of healthy pigs. No clear correlation with a particular serotype was observed. These results demonstrate the occurrence of unique sugar-specific adherence activities in S. suis, an important pig pathogen with occasional human pathogenicity.
TI  - [Preparation of immunosorbents from lipopolysaccharides and polysaccharides extracted from various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The method of binding of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from Salmonella typhimurium to aminohexyl-sepharose 4B by activation with benzoquinone was applied to three different LPS extracted from several enterobacteria species: S. seftenberg 1,3,19, S. cholerae suis 6(2),7 and Escherichia coli O141:H32. It was also used for two polysaccharides (PS) extracted from S. seftenberg 1,3,19 and Streptococcus agalactiae type II strain, respectively. Both PS were free from amino groups but exhibited the corresponding antigenic determinants of the cell wall. The use of these immunosorbents enabled us to obtain a monospecific antiserum. They may be a useful tool for serological identification of salmonella and group B streptococci. This method may be applied for other bacterial surface PS. The possible regeneration of such immunosorbents without appreciable loss of their antigen binding capacity makes possible their use for obtaining monospecific antibodies on a preparative scale.
TI  - The type-specific polysaccharides of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - Streptococcus suis types 1 and 2 were subjected to digestion with lysozyme. Serologically type-specific capsular polysaccharides were isolated from the lysates by ethanol precipitation followed by Sepharose 6B chromatography. The purified type 1 polysaccharide has a Kd value of 0.074 on a Sepharose 4B column and contains galactose, glucose, N-acetyl glucosamine, N-acetyl galactosamine, and sialic acid in a molar ratio of 2.42:1.00:1.00:1.13:1.39. The type 2 polysaccharide has a Kd value of 0.185 and is composed of rhamnose, galactose, glucose, N-acetyl glucosamine, and sialic acid in a molar ratio of 1.07:3.17:1.00:0.94:1.00. A comparison is drawn between the type polysaccharides of S. suis and those of group B streptococci.
