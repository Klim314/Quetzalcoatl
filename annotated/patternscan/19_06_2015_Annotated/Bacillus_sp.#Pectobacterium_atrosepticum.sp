TI  == effective biotic elicitation of ruta graveolens l. shoot cultures by lysates from pectobacterium atrosepticum and bacillus sp.
AB  == growth of ruta graveolens shoots was induced when bacillus sp. cell lysates were  added to the culture medium. elicitation of coumarin by this lysate was also very effective; the concentrations of isopimpinelin, xanthotoxin and bergapten increased to 610, 2120 and 1460 microg g(-1) dry wt, respectively. it also had a  significant effect on the production of psoralen and rutamarin (680 and 380 microg g(-1) dry wt) and induced the biosynthesis of chalepin, which was not detected in the control sample, up to 47 microg g(-1) dry wt with lysates of the  pectobacterium atrosepticum, their effect on growth was not so significant and had no effect on the induction of coumarin accumulation. but elicitation with this lysate was much more effective for inducing the production of furoquinolone  alkaloids; the concentrations of gamma-fagarine, skimmianine, dictamnine and kokusaginine rose to 99, 680, 172 and 480 microg g(-1) dry wt, respectively.
