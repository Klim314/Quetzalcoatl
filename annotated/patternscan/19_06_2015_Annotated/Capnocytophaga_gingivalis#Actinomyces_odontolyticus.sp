TI  == the association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in brazilian adults with hiv: a multilevel analysis.
AB  == background: this study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) viral load (hvl) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with hiv. methods: thirty-seven individuals with hiv were divided into two groups: 1) detectable hvl (n = 15); and 2) undetectable hvl (n = 22). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, fisher exact test, and mann-whitney u test were used to compare groups. multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between hvl and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. results: of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable hvl group than undetectable hvl group (p <0.001). these species included actinomyces naeslundii  ii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter concisus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and candida  albicans. significant associations between detectable hvl and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for a. naeslundii i, actinomyces gerencseriae, c. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythia, and dialister pneumosintes. conclusion: detectable plasmatic hvl in individuals with hiv was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as p. nigrescens, t. forsythia, and e. corrodens, as well as c. concisus, c. gingivalis, and d. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == false positive pcr detection of tropheryma whipplei in the saliva of healthy people.
AB  == background: tropheryma whipplei, the agent of whipple's disease (wd), has been recently isolated and the genomes of two isolates have been fully sequenced. previous diagnosis tools for the diagnosis of the disease used sequence analysis  of the 16s rrna gene. using this target gene, the high percentage of detection of the bacterium in saliva of healthy people was in contrast to the negative results obtained with specific target genes. the aim of our study was to compare previously published primers targeting the 16s rrna gene to real-time pcr with taqman* probes targeting specific repeat genes only found in the genome of t. whipplei in a series of 57 saliva from healthy people. results: although the specific real-time pcr assays with both primers and probes were negative for all  the samples, 13 out of 57 samples were positive with different primers previously reported targeting the 16s rrna gene. among the positive samples, 8 yielded a 231-bp sequence that was 99.1% identical to that of actinomyces odontolyticus, 2  yielded a 226-bp that was 99.6% identical to that of a. turicensis, and 3 yielded a 160-bp sequence that was 98.5% identical to that of capnocytophaga gingivalis.  we found that the c. gingivalis and a. odontolyticus 16s rrna sequences obtained  in our study share more than 80% homology with the corresponding 16s rrna sequences of the t. whipplei genomes especially at 5' and 3' end. conclusion: asymptomatic carriers of t. whipplei in saliva may exist but their prevalence is  much lower than those previously reported. testing the specificity of designed primers is critical to avoid false positive detection of t. whipplei. in atypical case we recommend to test two different specific target genes before concluding.

TI  == antibacterial activity of medicinal plant extracts against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of althaea officinalis l. roots, arnica montana l. flowers, calendula officinalis l. flowers, hamamelis virginiana l. leaves, illicium verum hook. fruits and melissa  officinalis l. leaves, against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veilonella parvula, eikenella corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces odontolyticus. the methanol extracts of h. virginiana and a. montana and, to a lesser extent, a. officinalis were shown to possess an inhibiting activity (mic < or = 2048 mg/l) against many of the species tested. in comparison, m. officinalis and c. officinalis extracts had a lower inhibiting activity (mic > or = 2048 mg/l) against all the tested species with the exception of prevotella sp. illicium verum methanol extract was not very active though it had a particular good activity against e. corrodens. the results suggest the use of the alcohol extracts of h. virginiana, a. montana and a. officinalis for topical medications in periodontal prophylactics.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == rapid characterization of periodontal bacterial isolates by using fluorogenic substrate tests.
AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with an altered subgingival environment induced by periodontal pocket reduction.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to study the effect of an altered subgingival environment, induced by changing the local soft tissue morphology, i.e., pocket depth reduction, on the subgingival microbiota and the clinical conditions. 7 patients aged 30-60 years with generalized marginal periodontitis were selected. patients were instructed in proper oral hygiene and all teeth were cleaned supragingivally. mucoperiosteal flaps were raised and the bone re-contoured to eliminate angular bony defects. while the control teeth were carefully debrided and thoroughly root planed, no root instrumentation was performed on the test teeth. calculus deposits visible to the naked eye were only chipped-off with the tip of a scaler. the flaps were apically repositioned and sutured at the level of the bone crest. clinical parameters showed a similar pattern of response in the test and control sites over a one year observation period post therapy. probing depths and probing attachment levels were significantly reduced one month after surgery and remained at a lower level. a significant decrease was also noted for total anaerobic viable bacterial counts.  the proportion of the gram-negative anaerobic rods decreased significantly in both groups. p. gingivalis, fusobacterium sp., c rectus were detected significantly less often after treatment in both groups. capnocytophaga and a. odontolyticus, on the other hand, were more frequently isolated after therapy. these findings corroborate the concept that the reduction of selected subgingival microorganisms is the key element for the success of periodontal therapy, rather  than the removal of tooth substance and mineralized deposits by root instrumentation.

TI  == subgingival microflora, dental and periodontal conditions in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance.
AB  == hereditary fructose intolerance (hfi) is a rare autosomally recessive disease which leads to severe hypoglycemia. the fructose-free diet of these patients apparently influences dental health. half of the patients are free of caries, but there are no reports on their periodontal condition nor on the composition of their subgingival microflora. therefore 18 patient with hfi were examined for the following parameters: radiographic bone loss, caries rate, gingival bleeding, occurrence of calculus, pocket depths, salivary flow rate, buffer capacity and ph from paraffin wax-stimulated saliva. salivary s. mutans and lactobacilli were also enumerated. specific antibody titers from whole saliva and serum to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans gamma 4, bacteroides gingivalis, and capnocytophaga ochracea were determined with elisa. finally the subgingival plaque was analyzed by culture. altogether 196 anaerobic or microaerophilic isolates representing 29 different species were obtained from the hfi patients and 164 isolates of 26 species from the controls. the frequency of actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, and wolinella recta in the hfi patients was significantly high the dmf-induces were lower in the study group than in the controls and so was the occurrence of s. mutans and lactobacilli in the saliva. of the periodontal parameters examined, the only difference found was an increased incidence of gingival bleeding and calculus formation in the hfi patients. the results suggest that in the hfi patients the common gingival bleeding is associated with the more frequent occurrence of actinomyces odontolyticus, veillonella parvula, and wolinella recta.

TI  == the comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (se) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) was compared. equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of se were used to challenge hgf cultures. the cytotoxic potential of each se was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit hgf proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3h-thymidine incorporation in hgf cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. the highest concentration (500 micrograms se protein/ml) of any of the ses used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the hgfs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. at  the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms se protein/ml); only se from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the hgfs as determined by any of the criteria employed. se from capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, or wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less  than that of the first group of three organisms named above. the se of the three  other organisms tested (actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. the data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.

TI  == coaggregation of oral bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == plasmid content of some oral microorganisms isolated from subgingival plaque.
AB  == eighty-five strains of bacterial species selected from the predominant cultivable dental plaque flora of patients with different periodontal pathologies were examined for their plasmid content. microorganisms studied included: actinomyces  viscosus, a. odontolyticus, bacteroides asaccharolyticus (b. gingivalis), b. melaninogenicus subspecies intermedius, and subspecies melaninogenicus, capnocytophaga ochracea (b. ochraceus), and fusobacterium nucleatum. three b. melaninogenicus isolates showed plasmids of approximately 2.7-2.9 mdalton (mega-dalton) molecular size. restriction enzyme digests of the plasmids demonstrated dissimilar patterns when electrophoresed on agarose gels. in other microorganisms, including the actinomyces species, plasmids were not observed.
