TI  == antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from magnolia officinalis.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of magnolia officinalis was investigated. the antimicrobial activity was assayed by  the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) were determined for each compound using a twofold  serial dilution assay. the results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (mic = 25 microg/ml) against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (mic > or = 100 microg/ml) for shigella flexneii, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
