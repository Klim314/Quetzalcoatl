TI  == performance evaluation and bacteria analysis of afb-mfc enriched with high-strength synthetic wastewater.
AB  == in order to study the performance and bacterial communities of an anaerobic fluidized bed microbial fuel cell (afb-mfc) system, the 16s rdna gene sequencing  was applied, and high-strength synthetic wastewater was treated by the afb-mfc system. the high-strength synthetic wastewater, in which the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (cod), nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen were above 19,000, 2,516-3,871 and 927-1,427 mg/l, was treated by the afb-mfc system. the removal efficiency of cod, nitrite nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen reached 70-89,  98 and 98%, while the maximum voltage was 394 mv. the bacteria analysis revealed  the presence of alistipes putredinis, carnobacterium sp., victivallis vadensis, klebsiella pneumoniae, thauera sp., parabacteroides merdae, parvimonas micra, parabacteroides sp., and desulfomicrobium baculatum in the anode chamber. in addition, the klebsiella pneumoniae was observed to have the capability of organic degradation and electricity generation, while the thauera sp. has the capability of denitrification.

TI  == anaerocella delicata gen. nov., sp. nov., a strictly anaerobic bacterium in the phylum bacteroidetes isolated from a methanogenic reactor of cattle farms.
AB  == a strictly anaerobic bacterial strain (wn081(t)) was isolated from rice-straw residue in a methanogenic reactor treating waste from cattle farms in japan. cells were gram-staining negative, non-motile, non-spore-forming straight rods. the strain grew rather well on py agar slants supplemented with a b-vitamin mixture as well as sugars (pyv4s medium) and made translucent and glossy colonies. growth in liquid medium with the same composition, however, was scanty, and growth was not improved in spite of various additives to the medium. strain wn081(t) produced small amounts of acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate and h(2) from pyv liquid medium. the strain did not use carbohydrates or organic acids. the ph range for growth was narrow (ph 6.8-8.2), having a ph optimum at 6.8-7.5. the temperature range for growth was 10-37 degrees c, the optimum being 25-30 degrees c. the strain was sensitive to bile, and did not have catalase or oxidase activities. hydrogen sulfide was produced from l-cysteine and l-methionine as well as peptone. indole was produced from l-tryptophan and peptone. the strain had iso-c(15:0) as the exclusively predominant cellular fatty acid (70%) together with some branched chain components (such as iso-c(15:0) dma, iso-c(17:0) 3-oh and iso-c(15:0) aldehyde) as minor components. the genomic dna g+c content was 32.3 mol%. phylogenetic analysis based on the 16s rrna gene sequence placed strain wn081(t) in the phylum bacteroidetes with rather low sequence similarities with the related species such as rikenella microfusus (85.7% sequence similarity), alistipes putredinis (85.5%) and alistipes finegoldii (85.5%) in the family rikenellaceae. based on the phylogenetic, physiological and chemotaxonomic analyses, the novel genus and species anaerocella delicata gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain. the type strain is wn081(t) (= jcm 17049(t) = dsm 23595(t)).

TI  == reclassification of bacteroides putredinis (weinberg et al., 1937) in a new genus alistipes gen. nov., as alistipes putredinis comb. nov., and description of alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., from human sources.
AB  == during studies on the bacteriology of appendicitis in children, we often isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed tissue samples, an unusual bile-resistant pigment-producing strictly anaerobic gram-negative rod. phenotypically this organism resembles members of bacteroides fragilis group of species, as it is resistant to bile and exhibits a special-potency-disk pattern (resistance to vancomycin, kanamycin and colistin) typical for the b. fragilis group. however, the production of brown pigment on media containing haemolysed blood and a cellular fatty acid composition dominated by iso-c15:0, suggests that the organism most closely resembles species of the genus porphyromonas. however, the  unidentified organism differs from porphyromonads by being bile-resistant and by  not producing butyrate as a metabolic end-product. comparative 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism represents a distinct sub-line, associated with but distinct from, the miss-classified species bacteroides putredinis. the clustering of the unidentified bacterium with bacteroides putredinis was statistically significant, but they displayed > 4% sequence divergence with each other. chromosomal dna-dna pairing studies further  confirmed the separateness of the unidentified bacterium and bacteroides putredinis. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that bacteroides putredinis and the unidentified bacterium from human sources be  classified in a new genus alistipes, as alistipes putredinis comb. nov. and alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., respectively. the type strain of alistipes finegoldii is ccug 46020(t) (= ahn243(t)).
