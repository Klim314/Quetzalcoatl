TI  - Lactobacillus frumenti sp. nov., a new lactic acid bacterium isolated from rye-bran fermentations with a long fermentation period.
AB  - Within the framework of the characterization of the microflora of an industrial sourdough fermentation, strains of Lactobacillus amylovorus, Lactobacillus pontis and two other strains were isolated which could not be associated with a valid species. These latter strains were Gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods that could be clearly differentiated from known species by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. For further characterization, the morphological, physiological (sugar fermentation, formation of DL-lactate, hydrolysis of arginine, growth temperature, CO2 production) and chemotaxonomic (G+C content, cell wall composition, SDS-PAGE of whole-cell proteins) properties were determined. Fitting of the complete 16S rDNA sequence into alignments of such sequences, together with the subsequent phylogenetic calculations, allowed the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree. These data showed that the two strains were phylogenetically related but formed an independent cluster distinct from their closest neighbours, L. pontis, Lactobacillus panis, Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus reuteri. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization experiments indicated that the two isolates represent a new Lactobacillus species, for which the name Lactobacillus frumenti is proposed; the type strain of this species is DSM 13145T (= LMG 19473T).
TI  - Multiplex PCR for the detection of Lactobacillus pontis and two related species in a sourdough fermentation.
AB  - A specific multiplex PCR assay based on the amplification of parts of the 16S rRNA molecule was designed. Primers derived from variable regions of the 16S rRNA provided a means of easily differentiating the species Lactobacillus pontis and Lactobacillus panis. They could be clearly discriminated from the phylogenetically related species Lactobacillus vaginalis, Lactobacillus oris, and Lactobacillus reuteri and from other lactobacilli commonly known to be present in sourdough. Other strains isolated together with L. pontis from an industrial sourdough fermentation could be clearly separated from these species by comparative sequence analysis and construction of a specific PCR primer. For a fast identification a DNA isolation protocol based on the ultrasonic lysis of cells from single colonies was developed. To demonstrate the potential of such techniques for tracking these organisms in a laboratory-scale fermentation, we combined the specific PCR assay with direct DNA extraction from the organisms in the sourdough without previous cultivation.
TI  - The identification of vaginal Lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. Vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal DNA probes to 20 American Type Culture Collection Lactobacillus strains. Most women were colonized by L. crispatus (32%), followed by L. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated L. 1086V (15%), L. gasseri (5%), L. fermentum (0.3%), L. oris (0.3%), L. reuteri (0.3%), L. ruminis (0.3%), and L. vaginalis (0.3%). H2O2 was produced by 95% of L. crispatus and 94% of L. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of L. 1086V. Colonization by L. crispatus or L. jensenii was positively associated with being white (P<.001), age >/=20 years (P=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (P=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (P<.001) and gonorrhea (P=.03). L. crispatus and L. jensenii, not L. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.
