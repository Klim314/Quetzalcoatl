TI  == evaluation of bacterial nitrate reduction in the human oral cavity.
AB  == it is hypothesized that the enterosalivary nitrate circulation encourages nitrate reducing bacteria to reside within the oral cavity. nitrite production may then limit the growth of acidogenic bacteria as a result of the production of antimicrobial oxides of nitrogen, including nitric oxide. this study was carried  out with 10 subjects to characterize oral nitrate reduction and identify the bacteria responsible. nitrate reduction varied between individuals (mean 85.4 +/- 15.9 nmol nitrite min(-1) with 10 ml 1 mm kno(3) mouth wash) and was found to be  concentrated at the rear of the tongue dorsal surface. nitrate reductase positive isolates identified, using 16s rdna sequencing, from the tongue comprised veillonella atypica (34%), veillonella dispar (24%), actinomyces odontolyticus (21%), actinomyces naeslundii (2%), rothia mucilaginosa (10%), rothia dentocariosa (3%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (5%). nitrite production rates,  using intact and permeabilized cells, of the major tongue nitrate reducers were determined in the presence of methyl and benzyl viologen. under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, rates in decreasing order were: a. odontolyticus > r. mucilaginosa > r. dentocariosa > v. dispar > v. atypica. in conclusion, veillonella spp. were found to be the most prevalent taxa isolated and thus may make a major contribution to nitrate reduction in the oral cavity.

TI  == microbial analysis of bone collected during implant surgery: a clinical and laboratory study.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris which can be used to correct bone defects in the "simultaneous-augmentation" technique. however, this debris is potentially contaminated with oral bacteria. therefore, this study examined bone  debris collected during dental implant surgery in order 1) to identify the microbial contaminants and 2) to compare the effects of two different aspiration  protocols on the levels of microbial contamination. twenty-four partially dentate patients were randomly allocated into two equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector during surgery to insert two endosseous dental implants. in group s (using a stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection occurred within the surgical site only. in group ns (utilizing a non-stringent aspiration protocol), bone collection and tissue fluid control was  achieved using the same suction tip. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilized for identification of the isolated microbes. twenty-eight species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis as well as the anaerobes actinomyces odontolyticus, eubacterium sp., prevotella intermedia, propionibacterium propionicum and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. in group s (stringent aspiration protocol), significantly fewer organisms were found than in group ns, the non-stringent aspiration protocol (p=0.001). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is collected for implantation around dental implants, it should be collected with a stringent aspiration protocol (within the surgical site only) to minimize bacterial contaminants.

TI  == beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == use of monoclonal antibodies with neutralizing effects on toxic antigens from human bacterial plaque to detect specific bacteria by colony blotting.
AB  == inflammatory periodontal diseases are provoked by bacteria which adhere to teeth  at the gingival margin and form plaques containing toxins detectable by their effect on mammalian cells in culture. the aim of this study was to make toxin-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and determine whether they detect antigen in specific oral bacteria. bacterial plaque was collected from teeth and  homogenized, and the fluid phase (plaque extract) was boiled or first fractionated over sephacryl s-300. hybridomas from immunized mice secreted immunoglobulin m (igm) antibodies which reacted to plaque antigens. neutralization was detected by an increase in the growth of hl60 cells which were exposed to plaque toxins in the presence of igm from hybridoma culture or ascitic fluids. however, the neutralization was obvious only when the plaque toxins reduced growth by 50% or less. plaque toxin preparations were found to contain proteases which hydrolyzed all of the igm in ascitic fluids within 24 h. replenishing the igm daily preserved protection compared with protection from igm from other hybridomas or saline only. the decrease in the specific activity of plaque proteins caused by replenishing one such antibody (3he5) was 2.5-fold compared with activity with unreplenished 3he5, 3.8-fold compared with activity with saline only, and 10.7-fold compared with activity with replenished, unrelated antibody. the neutralizing igm detected an array of 14,000- to 22,000-molecular-weight antigens. the native toxins may be aggregates of these antigens, or the array may indicate fragments of an undetected, larger antigen or a common, nonpeptide adduct. only 0.5 to 0.8% of the bacteria from sites with periodontitis and grown on blood agar contained antigen. one group of reactive bacteria was identified as actinomyces odontolyticus serotype i. other isolates were identified as staphylococcus epidermidis, but antigen disappeared from the these isolates within 6 weeks of subculture. epitope-containing antigens were also found in streptococcal and eikenella isolates, and it is likely that the antigens from only some of these bacteria are toxic.

TI  == keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral bacteria.
AB  == a test was developed to measure the keratinolytic activity of cutaneous and oral  bacteria. keratin, labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, was used in a phosphate buffer (ph 7.2) with 1 mm dithiothreitol. the degradation of keratin was estimated by measuring the fluorescence of the degradation products in the supernatant of the reaction mixtures in a luminescence spectrometer. several oral and cutaneous bacteria were investigated: bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, treponema denticola, actinomyces odontolyticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus  saprophyticus, brevibacterium epidermidis, brevibacterium lines, corynebacterium  glutamicum, corynebacterium minutissimum, corynebacterium ovis, and rhodococcus equi. the dermatophyte trichophyton rubrum was used as a control organism. the test offered a simple and quantitative method for the estimation of keratin degradation and enabled us to show keratinolytic activity in trichophyton rubrum, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, b. linens, b. epidermidis, bacteroides gingivalis, and treponema denticola. the keratinolytic activity was cell bound and heat sensitive. the presence of dithiothreitol stimulated the degradation of  keratin to mainly high-molecular-weight products.
