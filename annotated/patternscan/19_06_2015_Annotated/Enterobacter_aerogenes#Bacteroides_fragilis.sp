TI  == intraoperative vancomycin use in spinal surgery: single institution experience and microbial trends.
AB  == study design: retrospective case series. objective: to demonstrate the microbial  trends of spinal surgical site infections in patients who had previously received crystallized vancomycin in the operative bed. summary of background data: prior large, case control series demonstrate the significant decrease in surgical site  infection with the administration of vancomycin in the wound bed. methods: a single institution, electronic database search was conducted for all patients who underwent spinal surgery who had received prophylactic crystalline vancomycin powder in the wound bed. patients with a prior history of wound infection, intrathecal pumps, or spinal stimulators were excluded. results: a total of 981 consecutive patients (494 males, 487 females; mean age, 59.4 yr; range, 16-95 yr) were identified from january 2011 to june 2013. the average dose of vancomycin powder was 1.13 g (range, 1-6 g). sixty-six patients (6.71%) were diagnosed with  a surgical site infection, of which 51 patients had positive wound cultures (5.2%). of the 51 positive cultures, the most common organism was staphylococcus  aureus. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.3 g in the 38 cases where a gram-positive organism was cultured. a number of gram-negative infections were encountered such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter koseri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the average dose of vancomycin was 1.2 g in 23 cases where a gram-negative infection was cultured. fifteen of the 51 positive cultures (29.4%) were polymicrobial. eight (53%) of these 15 polymicrobial cultures contained 3 or more distinct organisms. conclusion: prophylactic intraoperative vancomycin use in the wound bed in spinal surgery may increase the incidence of gram-negative or polymicrobial spinal infections. the use of intraoperative vancomycin may correlate with postoperative seromas, due to the high incidence of nonpositive cultures. large, randomized, prospective trials are needed to demonstrate causation and dose-response relationship.

TI  == bacterial indicators of pollution of the douala lagoon, cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == background: indiscriminate disposal of untreated wastes which are often heavily laden with sewage microorganisms some of which are pathogenic to humans into aquatic environments near cities could serve as potential dangers to human health. objective: a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the scope of potential bacterial pathogens and to assess the extent of pollution of the douala lagoon. methods: a total of eighty water samples were collected fortnightly from  the lagoon at five stations from march to october 2005 and analysed for heterotrophic bacterial densities, coliform counts, faecal coliform and faecal streptococcal counts. bacteria were isolated and identified using standard microbiology and biochemical techniques. results: high heterotrophic bacterial counts (33 x 10(5) - 161 x 10(5) cfu/ ml), total coliform counts (1.8 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) cfu/100 ml), faecal coliform counts (2.2 x 10(2) - 2.4 x 10(2) cfu/ 100 ml) and faecal streptococcal counts (2.1 x 102 - 2.3 x 10(2) cfu/100ml were observed in all sampling stations. eleven species of bacteria: bacteroides fragilis, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter freundii, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus mycoides and serratia marcesens, were frequently isolated. conclusion: the presence of potential bacterial agents such as bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli in the lagoon may pose a serious threat to the health and  well being of users of the lagoon and calls for urgent intervention.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == in vitro activities of ertapenem (mk-0826) against recent clinical bacteria collected in europe and australia.
AB  == ertapenem (mk-0826, l-749,345) is a 1-beta-methyl carbapenem with a long serum half-life. its in vitro activity was determined by broth microdilution against 3,478 bacteria from 12 centers in europe and australia, with imipenem, cefepime,  ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam used as comparators. ertapenem was the most active agent tested against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, with mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of < or =1 microg/ml for all species. ertapenem also was more active than imipenem against fastidious gram-negative bacteria and moraxella spp.; on the other hand, ertapenem was slightly less active than imipenem against streptococci, methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci, and anaerobes, but its mic(90)s for these groups remained < or =0.5 microg/ml. acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also much less susceptible to ertapenem than imipenem, and most enterococcus faecalis strains were resistant. ertapenem resistance, based on a provisional nccls mic breakpoint of > or =16 microg/ml, was seen in only 3 of 1,611 strains of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, all of them enterobacter aerogenes. resistance was also seen in 2 of 135 anaerobes, comprising 1 bacteroides fragilis strain and 1 clostridium difficile strain. ertapenem breakpoints for streptococci have not been established, but an unofficial susceptibility breakpoint of < or =2 microg/ml was adopted for clinical trials to generate corresponding clinical response data for isolates for which mics were as high as 2 microg/ml. of 234 streptococcus pneumoniae strains tested, 2 required ertapenem mics of 2 microg/ml and one required an mic of 4 microg/ml, among 67 non-streptococcus pyogenes, non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci, single isolates required ertapenem mics of 2 and 16 microg/ml. these streptococci also had diminished susceptibilities to other beta-lactams, including imipenem as well as ertapenem.  the etest and disk diffusion gave susceptibility test results in good agreement with those of the broth microdilution method for ertapenem.

TI  == in vitro activity of cp-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cp-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. cp-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin g and erythromycin (mic90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). cp-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against s. pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (mic90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). the activity of cp-99,219 against enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii, c.  diversus, helicobacter pylori, and k. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with mic90 values to cp-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 for bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for cp-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. cp-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x mic against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented mueller-hinton broths. the spectrum and potency observed with cp-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy 7 beta acyl ureido cephalosporin.
AB  == the activity of cefbuperazone, a 7 alpha-methoxy ureido cephalosporin, was determined against 726 clinical isolates. ninety percent of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, salmonella, and shigella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin and piperacillin against these species. concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml of cefbuperazone were needed to inhibit serratia marcescens and providencia species, and 50% of enterobacter cloacae had mics greater than 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was less active by 8 to 32-fold than cefotaxime or moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae. cefbuperazone did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas species. hemolytic streptococci were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml  and staphylococci by 25 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone had activity comparable to cefoxitin and moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis with mic90s of 6.3 micrograms/ml. cefbuperazone was not hydrolyzed by plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases and was an inhibitor of the p99 e. cloacae beta-lactamase with an i50 of 1 microgram/ml. it was a less effective inhibitor of the k. oxytoca k1 and e. coli tem-1 beta-lactamases than was clavulanic acid. cefbuperazone induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa and resistant e. cloacae. a permeability barrier in e. cloacae, c. freundii and p. aeruginosa is suggested by the potentiation of  cefbuperazone's activity by edta.

TI  == dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  == bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. the disk  diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the united states were compared. no significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, or streptococcus faecalis  for this period; enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. slight increases in susceptibility were observed with pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.

TI  == cefamandole-erythromycin-heparin peritoneal irrigation: an adjunct to the surgical treatment of diffuse bacterial peritonitis.
AB  == the enthusiasm for the use of peritoneal irrigation has waxed and waned since its introduction by dr. pierce in 1905. the purpose of this study was to devise a relatively low-cost irrigant that could be used for continuous intraperitoneal lavage, with the intent of decreasing abscess formation following surgical treatment for generalized bacterial peritonitis. a solution of 1 l of normal saline containing 50 mg erythromycin, 50 mg cefamandole, 500 u heparin, and 5 meq kcl was proven in in vitro studies to be bactericidal to peptococcus anaerobius and clostridium perfringens, and bacteriostatic to klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis. in a prospective study 50 patients underwent peritoneal lavage with 36  l over 2 days. no lavage patients developed intraabdominal abscesses. in a control group of 44 patients seven patients (15.9%) developed postoperative abscesses.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of e-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of e-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and  gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. e-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (mic50) of 25 micrograms for staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with streptococcus faecalis resistant. e-0702 had mic50s against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but mic90s were higher than those of the other agents. it was as active as the other  agents against proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., and shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, providencia spp., morganella spp., and proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. activity against bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. e-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. there was an inoculum effect for e. cloacae, serratia spp., morganella spp., and pseudomonas spp.

TI  == cefotetan: antimicrobial activity in-vitro compared with that of cefotaxime.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefotetan and cefotaxime were compared in vitro against 547 strains of aerobes and 24 strains of bacteroides fragilis. the strains were recent clinical isolates from 20 hospitals. cefotetan was found to exhibit an activity two- to fourfold lower than that of cefotaxime against most of the enterobacteriaceae. about half the number of enterobacter aerogenes and enterobacter cloacae strains resistant to cefotetan were resistant also to cefotaxime. cefotetan was more active than cefotaxime against most of the strains of proteus vulgaris. in contrast to cefotaxime which was moderately active, cefotetan was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan had limited activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis was resistant to both cefotetan and cefotaxime. bact. fragilis was inhibited more effectively by cefotetan than by cefotaxime. depending on the species tested, the activity of cefotetan was influenced significantly by the inoculum size in some cases. different test media did not affect the results.

TI  == in vitro activity of apalcillin compared with that of other new penicillins and anti-pseudomonas cephalosporins.
AB  == apalcillin, a naphthydridine derivative of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone  against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the minimal concentrations of apalcillin at which 50 and 90% of hospital isolates of escherichia coli were inhibited were similar to those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1.6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). apalcillin had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against citrobacter freundii and citrobacter diversus. against klebsiella, apalcillin inhibited 50% of organisms at a concentration of 6.3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. the activity of apalcillin against enterobacter (e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, and e. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. the activity of apalcillin against proteus mirabilis was similar to  that of the other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive proteus and providencia. only 40% of serratia were inhibited at an apalcillin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. apalcillin was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against bacteroides fragilis. it was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against p. aeruginosa (apalcillin inhibited 90% of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). there was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. apalcillin was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases.

TI  == augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  == clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. when combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing  strains of staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacilli. bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, in  addition strains of klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. the beta-lactamases produced by enterobacter spp, proteus morgani, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant  to augmentin (1).

TI  == cefonicid: a stable beta-lactamase inhibitor.
AB  == the stability of cefonicid (sk&f 75073) towards representatives of six major classes of beta-lactamases was determined using a spectrophotometric assay. cefonicid was stable to hydrolysis by the type i enzyme from enterobacter cloacae and by the enzyme from the anaerobe, bacteroides fragilis. it was 6 to 7 times more stable than cefamandole to the type iiia and b enzymes from escherichia coli, a little less stable than this antibiotic to the type v enzyme from e. coli, and of equal stability to the type iv enzyme from klebsiella aerogenes. cefonicid was a non-competitive inhibitor (ki of 0.8 x 10(-6)m) of cephalothin hydrolysis by the type i enzyme.

TI  == evaluation of the four-hour micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative, gram-negative rods from blood cultures.
AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
