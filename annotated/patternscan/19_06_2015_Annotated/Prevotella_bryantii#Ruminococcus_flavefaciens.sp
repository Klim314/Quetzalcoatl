TI  == study of rumen metagenome community using qpcr under different diets.
AB  == the aim of this study was to detect the major bacteria present in rumen microbiota. here, we performed qpcr based absolute quantitation of selected rumen microbes in rumen fluid of river buffalo adapted to varying proportion of concentrate to roughage diets. animals were adapted to roughage-to-concentrate ratio in the proportion of 100:00 (t1), 75:25 (t2), 50:50 (t3) and 25:75 (t4) respectively for 30 days. at the end of each treatment, rumen fluid was collected at 0 h and 2 h after feeding. it was found that among fibrolytic bacteria ruminococcus flavefaciens (2.22 x 10(8) copies/ml) were highest in t2 group and followed by 1.11 x 10(8) copies/ml for fibrobacter succinogenes (t2), 2.56 x 10(7) copies/ml for prevotella ruminicola (t1) and 1.25 x 10(7) copies/ml for ruminococcus albus (t4). in non-fibrolytic bacteria, the selenomonas ruminantium  (2.62 x 10(7) copies/ml) was predominant in group t3 and followed by treponema bryantii (2.52 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group t1, ruminobacter amylophilus (1.31 x 10(7)copies/ml) in group t1 and anaerovibrio lipolytica (2.58 x 10(6) copies/ml)  in group t4. it is most notable that r. flavefaciens were the highest in population in the rumen of surti buffalo fed wheat straw as roughage source.

TI  == use of real-time pcr technique in determination of major fibrolytic and non fibrolytic bacteria present in indian surti buffaloes (bubalus bubalis).
AB  == in the milk industry in india, buffalo breeds are most commonly used for milk production. efficiency of fiber digestion in ruminants is critical for animal productivity. bacteria play an important role in fiber digestion and utilization. absolute quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify ten bacterial species  in rumen fluid of surti buffalo fed green fodder, dry roughage and compound concentrate mixture. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction  of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of ruminococcus albus, which comprised 5.66% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 0.9% to 4.24% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the ruminal fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens and prevotella species. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus bovis, ruminobacter amylophilus, treponema bryantii and anaerovibrio lipolytica was even less abundant, each comprising < 0.11% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == comparative evaluation of rumen metagenome community using qpcr and mg-rast.
AB  == microbial profiling of metagenome communities have been studied extensively using mg-rast and other related metagenome annotation databases. although, database based taxonomic profiling provides snapshots of the metagenome architecture, their reliability needs to be validated through more accurate methods. here, we performed qpcr based absolute quantitation of selected rumen microbes in the liquid and solid fraction of the rumen fluid of river buffalo adapted to varying  proportion of concentrate to green or dry roughages and compared with the mg-rast based annotation of the metagenomes sequences of 16s r-dna amplicons and high throughput shotgun sequencing. animals were adapted to roughage-to-concentrate ratio in the proportion of 50:50, 75:25 and 100:00, respectively for six weeks. at the end of each treatment, rumen fluid was collected at 3 h post feeding. qpcr revealed that the relative abundance of prevotella bryantii was higher, followed  by the two cellulolytic bacteria fibrobacter succinogens and ruminococcus flavefaciens that accounted up to 1.33% and 0.78% of the total rumen bacteria, respectively. while, selenomonas ruminantium and archaea methanomicrobiales were  lower in microbial population in the rumen of buffalo. there was no statistically significant difference between the enumerations shown by qpcr and analysis of the shotgun sequencing data by mg-rast except for prevotella. these results indicate  the variations in abundance of different microbial species in buffalo rumen under varied feeding regimes as well as in different fractions of rumen liquor, i.e. solid and the liquid. the results also present the reliability of shotgun sequencing to describe metagenome and analysis/annotation by mg-rast.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of brazilian propolis extracts against rumen bacteria in vitro.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of three brazilian propolis extracts was evaluated on  bacterial strains representing major rumen functional groups. the extracts were prepared using different concentrations of propolis and alcohol, resulting in different phenolic compositions. the propolis extracts inhibited the growth of fibrobacter succinogenes s85, ruminococcus flavefaciens fd-1, ruminococcus albus  7, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens d1, prevotella albensis m384, peptostreptococcus sp. d1, clostridium aminophilum f and streptococcus bovis pearl11, while r. albus 20, prevotella bryantii b(1)4 and ruminobacter amylophilus h18 were resistant to all  the extracts. the inhibited strains showed also different sensitivity to propolis; the hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria (c. aminophilum f and peptostreptococcus sp. d1) being the most sensitive. inhibition of hyper-ammonia-producing bacteria by propolis would be beneficial to the animal. the extract containing the lowest amount of phenolic compounds (llos c3) showed the lowest antimicrobial activity against all the bacteria. the major phenolic compounds identified in the propolis extracts (naringenin, chrysin, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid and artepillin c) were also evaluated on four sensitive strains.  only naringenin showed inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that naringenin is one of the components participating to the antibacterial activity of propolis.

TI  == effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  == this study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/l), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/l; origanum oil, 0.50 g/l, and peppermint oil, 1 g/l), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/l) in vitro. methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses  of vanillin. protozoa population decreased, but abundances of ruminococcus flavefaciens, prevotella bryantii, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, prevotella ruminicola, clostridium aminophilum, and ruminobacter amylophilus increased with  increasing doses of vanillin. origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. all the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, selenomonas ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola and p. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. the abundances of megasphaera elsdenii, c. aminophilum, and clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of b. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of s. ruminantium, r. amylophilus, p. ruminicola, and p. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). the results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.

TI  == effect of non-starch-polysaccharide-degrading enzymes as feed additive on the rumen bacterial population in non-lactating cows quantified by real-time pcr.
AB  == the effects of non-starch-polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, added to a maize silage- and grass silage-based total mixed ration (tmr) at least 14 h before feeding, on the rumen bacterial population were investigated. six non-lactating holstein friesian cows were allocated to three treatment groups using a duplicate 3 x 3 latin square design with three 31-day periods (29 days of adaptation and 2  days of sampling). treatments were control tmr [69% forage and 31% concentrates on a dry matter (dm) basis] or tmr with 13.8 or 27.7 ml/kg of feed dm of roxazyme g2 liquid with activities (u/ml enzyme preparation) of xylanase 260 000, beta-glucanase 180 000 and cellulase 8000 (dsm nutritional products, basel, switzerland). the concentrations of 16s rdna of anaerovibrio lipolytica, fibrobacter succinogenes, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and treponema bryantii, and their relative percentage of  total bacteria in rumen samples obtained before feeding and 3 and 7 h after feeding and from two rumen fractions were determined using real-time pcr. sampling time had only little influence, but bacterial numbers and the composition of the population differed between the transition layer between rumen fluid and the fibre mat (fraction a) and the rumen fluid (fraction b) highlighting the importance to standardize sampling. the 16s rdna copies of total bacteria and the six bacterial species as well as the population composition were mainly unaffected by the high levels of exogenous enzymes supplemented at all sampling times and in both rumen fractions. occasionally, the percentages of the  non-fibrolytic species p. ruminicola and a. lipolytica changed in response to enzyme supplementation. some increases in the potential degradability of the diet and decreases in lag time which occurred collaterally indicate that other factors than changes in numbers of non-particle-associated bacteria are mainly responsible for the effects of exogenous enzymes.

TI  == mitigation of methane production from cattle by feeding cashew nut shell liquid.
AB  == the effects of cashew nut shell liquid (cnsl) feeding on methane production and rumen fermentation were investigated by repeatedly using 3 holstein nonlactating  cows with rumen fistulas. the cows were fed a concentrate and hay diet (6:4 ratio) for 4 wk (control period) followed by the same diet with a cnsl-containing pellet for the next 3 wk (cnsl period). two trials were conducted using cnsl pellets blended with only silica (trial 1) or with several other ingredients (trial 2). each pellet type was fed to cows to allow cnsl intake at 4 g/100 kg of body weight per day. methane production was measured in a respiration chamber system, and energy balance, nutrient digestibility, and rumen microbial changes were monitored. methane production per unit of dry matter intake decreased by 38.3 and 19.3% in cnsl feeding trials 1 and 2, respectively. energy loss as methane emission decreased from 9.7 to 6.1% (trial 1) and from 8.4 to 7.0% (trial 2) with cnsl feeding, whereas the loss to feces (trial 1) and heat production (trial 2) increased. retained energy did not differ between the control and cnsl  periods. digestibility of dry matter and gross energy decreased with cnsl feeding in trial 1, but did not differ in trial 2. feeding cnsl caused a decrease in acetate and total short-chain fatty acid levels and an increase in propionate proportion in both trials. relative copy number of methyl coenzyme-m reductase subunit a gene and its expression decreased with cnsl feeding. the relative abundance of fibrolytic or formate-producing species such as ruminococcus flavefaciens, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and treponema bryantii decreased, but species related to propionate production, including prevotella ruminicolla, selenomonas ruminantium, anaerovibrio lipolytica, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, increased. if used in a suitable formulation, cnsl acts as a potent methane-inhibiting and propionate-enhancing agent through the alteration of rumen microbiota without adversely affecting feed digestibility.

TI  == use of prevotella bryantii 25a and a commercial probiotic during subacute acidosis challenge in midlactation dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of prevotella bryantii  25a as a probiotic during a subacute ruminal acidosis (sara) challenge using a commercial probiotic as a positive control. six multiparous ruminally fistulated  cows (bw=685 +/- 65 kg; (mean +/- sd) in the mid-phase of lactation (70 to 148 dim) received the following treatments in a replicated 3x3 latin square design: (1) total mixed ration (tmr; control, con), (2) tmr + 2g/head per day of a probiotic combination of enterococcus faecium and saccharomyces cerevisiae (efsc), or (3) tmr + prevotella bryantii 25a. the latin square consisted of 3 wk  of adaptation to the respective treatments during which the animals were fed ad libitum once per day a conventional early-lactation tmr and 1.5 kg of hay. the adaptation was followed by 4 d of sara (no hay) and 10d of rest (adaptation diet  without probiotics). dry matter intake and milk production were depressed during  sara (22.0 and 31.8 kg/d, respectively) compared with adaptation (24.4 and 34.0 kg/d, respectively) and did not recover during rest (22.3 and 30.7 kg/d, respectively). during sara, p. bryantii 25a had no effect on rumen ph, whereas efsc reduced the percentage of time with ph <6.0 (71%) compared with con (85%) and increased maximum ph. the efsc treatment tended to increase mean ph over 24h  (5.65) compared with con (5.45). proportion of time with ph <5.6 tended to be lower with efsc (46%) than with con (62%). populations of bacteria considered to  be the most important cellulose digesters in the rumen (ruminococcus flavefaciens, ruminococcus albus, and fibrobacter succinogenes) were also monitored during these treatments using culture-independent real-time pcr methods. the population of r. flavefaciens was similar between the 2 feeding phases, whereas f. succinogenes and r. albus were lower during sara compared with rest. in light of the present study, p. bryantii 25a did not prove to be an effective preventative for sara. the role of efsc in regulating rumen ph was confirmed, with a possible effect of maintaining r. flavefaciens populations during sara.

TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == plant cell wall breakdown by anaerobic microorganisms from the mammalian digestive tract.
AB  == degradation of lignocellulosic plant material in the mammalian digestive tract is accomplished by communities of anaerobic microorganisms that exist in symbiotic association with the host. catalytic domains and substrate-binding modules concerned with plant polysaccharide degradation are found in a variety of anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and protozoa from the mammalian gut. the organization  of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, however, varies widely. the cellulolytic gram-positive bacterium ruminococcus flavefaciens produces an elaborate cellulosomal enzyme complex that is anchored to the bacterial cell wall; assembly of the complex involves at least five different dockerin:cohesin specificities, and the r. flavefaciens genome encodes at least 180 dockerin-containing proteins  that encompass a wide array of catalytic and binding activities. on the other hand, in the cellulolytic protozoan, polyplastron multivesiculatum, individual plant cell wall-degrading enzymes appear to be secreted into food vacuoles, while the gram-negative bacterium prevotella bryantii appears to possess a sequestration-type system for the utilization of soluble xylans. the system that  is employed for polysaccharide utilization must play a major role in defining the ecological niche that each organism occupies within a complex gut community. 16s  rrna analyses are also revealing uncultured bacterial species closely adherent to fibrous substrates in the rumen and in the large intestine of animals and humans. the true complexity, both at a single organism and community level, of the microbial enzyme systems that allow animals to digest plant material is beginning to become apparent.

TI  == dominance of prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time pcr.
AB  == relative quantification real-time pcr was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. abundance of each target taxon was calculated as  a fraction of the total 16s rrna gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rrna gene copies in the samples. however, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rrna gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal prevotella species prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola and prevotella brevis. the proportion of rrna gene copies attributable to fibrobacter succinogenes, ruminococcus flavefaciens, selenomonas ruminantium and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. proportions for ruminobacter amylophilus and eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus albus and megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rrna gene copies. the data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the  most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.

TI  == degradation and utilization of xylans by the rumen anaerobe prevotella bryantii (formerly p. ruminicola subsp. brevis) b(1)4.
AB  == freshly harvested whole cells from cultures of p. bryantii b(1)4 grown with oat spelt xylan (osx) as an energy source showed less than 25% of the enzyme activity against osx, and less than 15% of the activity against birchwood xylan (bwx) and  carboxymethylcellulose, that was detectable in sonicated cell preparations. this  indicates that much of this hydrolytic activity is either periplasmic, membrane-associated or intracellular and may be concerned with the processing of  transported oligosaccharides.p. bryantii b(1)4 cultures were able to utilise up to 45% and 51% of the total pentose present in osx and bwx, respectively, after 24 h, but could utilize 84% of a water-soluble fraction of bwx. analysis of the xylan left undegraded after incubation with p. bryantii showed that while xylose  and arabinose were removed to a similar extent, uronic acids were utilized to a greater extent than xylose. predigestion of xylans with two cloned xylanases from the cellulolytic rumen anaerobe ruminococcus flavefaciens gave little increase in overall pentose utilization suggesting that external p. bryantii xylanases are as effective as the cloned r. flavefaciens enzymes in releasing products that can be utilised by p. bryantii cells. the xylanase system of p. bryantiiis able to efficiently utilise not only xylo-oligosaccharides but also larger water-soluble  xylan fragments.

TI  == diet-dependent shifts in the bacterial population of the rumen revealed with real-time pcr.
AB  == a set of pcr primers was designed and validated for specific detection and quantification of prevotella ruminicola, prevotella albensis, prevotella bryantii, fibrobacter succinogenes, selenomonas ruminantium-mitsuokella multiacida, streptococcus bovis, ruminococcus flavefaciens, ruminobacter amylophilus, eubacterium ruminantium, treponema bryantii, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and anaerovibrio lipolytica. by using these primers and the real-time pcr technique, the corresponding species in the rumens of cows for which the diet was switched from hay to grain were quantitatively monitored. the  dynamics of two fibrolytic bacteria, f. succinogenes and r. flavefaciens, were in agreement with those of earlier, culture-based experiments. the quantity of f. succinogenes dna, predominant in animals on the hay diet, fell 20-fold on the third day of the switch to a grain diet and further declined on day 28, with a 57-fold reduction in dna. the r. flavefaciens dna concentration on day 3 declined to approximately 10% of its initial value in animals on the hay diet and remained at this level on day 28. during the transition period (day 3), the quantities of  two ruminal prevotella dnas increased considerably: that of p. ruminicola increased 7-fold and that of p. bryantii increased 263-fold. on day 28, the quantity of p. ruminicola dna decreased 3-fold, while p. bryantii dna was still elevated 10-fold in comparison with the level found in animals on the initial hay diet. the dna specific for another xylanolytic bacterium, e. ruminantium, dropped 14-fold during the diet switch and was maintained at this level on day 28. the concentration of a rumen spirochete, t. bryantii, decreased less profoundly and stabilized with a sevenfold decline by day 28. the variations in a. lipolytica dna were not statistically significant. after an initial slight increase in s. dextrinosolvens dna on day 3, this dna was not detected at the end of the experiment. s. bovis dna displayed a 67-fold increase during the transition period on day 3. however, on day 28, it actually declined in comparison with the  level in animals on the hay ration. the amount of s. ruminantium-m. multiacida dna also increased eightfold following the diet switch, but stabilized with only  a twofold increase on day 28. the real-time pcr technique also uncovered differential amplification of rumen bacterial templates with the set of universal bacterial primers. this observation may explain why some predominant rumen bacteria have not been detected in pcr-generated 16s ribosomal dna libraries.

TI  == effect of steroidal saponin from yucca schidigera extract on ruminal microbes.
AB  == the effects of steroidal saponins (sap) isolated from yucca schidigera extract on ruminal bacteria and fungi were investigated in pure culture studies. prevotella  bryantii, ruminobacter amylophilus, selenomonas ruminantium and streptococcus bovis were cultured through ten 24-h transfers in ruminal fluid medium containing 0 or 25 microg sap ml-1 (measured as smilagenin equivalents). the four strains, each non-exposed or pre-exposed to sap, were then inoculated into medium containing 0 or 250 microgram smilagenin equivalents ml-1 and 24-h growth curves  were determined. the cellulolytic ruminal bacteria ruminococcus flavefaciens, fibrobacter succinogenes and rc. albus were cultured for 72 h on whatman no. 1 filter paper in medium containing 0, 9, 90 or 180 microgram sap ml-1 for the determination of filter paper digestion and endoglucanase activity. the ruminal bacteria differed in their responses to sap. steroidal saponins in the medium reduced the growth of strep. bovis (p < 0.01 at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 h), p. bryantii (p < 0.05 at 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 24 h) and rb. amylophilus (p < 0.05 at 14 and 24 h), but the growth of s. ruminantium was enhanced (p < 0.05) at 10, 14  and 24 h. the growth curves of all four non-cellulolytic species were similar (p  > 0.05) between pre-exposed and non-exposed cultures and the concentrations of total sap and soluble (deglycosylated) sap in the liquid fraction were unchanged  (p > 0.05) over time. steroidal saponins inhibited the digestion of filter paper  by all three cellulolytic bacteria, but f. succinogenes was less (p < 0.05) sensitive to sap and more (p < 0. 05) effective at deglycosylating sap than were  rc. flavefaciens or rc. albus. transmission electron microscopy revealed that sap altered the cell walls of the sap-inhibited non-cellulolytic bacteria. the ruminal fungi, neocallimastix frontalis and piromyces rhizinflata, were cultured  on filter paper in medium containing 0, 0. 45, 2.25 or 4.5 microgram sap ml-1. filter paper digestion by both fungi was completely inhibited by 2.25 microgram sap ml-1. steroidal saponins from y. schidigera inhibit cellulolytic ruminal bacteria and fungi, but their effects on amylolytic bacteria are species dependent and similar to the effects of ionophores. as such, sap may be useful in nutritional applications targeting starch-digesting ruminal micro-organisms.
