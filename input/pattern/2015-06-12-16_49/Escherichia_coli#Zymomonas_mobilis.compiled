TI  - Synthetic sugar cassettes for the efficient production of flavonol glycosides in  Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A multi-monocistronic synthetic vector was used to assemble multiple  genes of a nucleotide diphosphate (NDP)-sugar biosynthetic pathway to construct robust genetic circuits for the production of valuable flavonoid glycosides in Escherichia coli. Characterized functional genes involved in the biosynthesis of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose and thymidine diphosphate (TDP)-rhamnose from various microbial sources along with glucose facilitator diffusion protein (glf) and glucokinase (glk) from Zymomonas mobilis were assembled and overexpressed in a single synthetic multi-monocistronic operon. RESULTS: The newly generated NDP-sugars biosynthesis circuits along with regiospecific glycosyltransferases from plants were introduced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) to probe the bioconversion of fisetin, a medicinally important polyphenol produced by various plants. As a result, approximately 1.178 g of fisetin 3-O-glucoside and 1.026 g of fisetin 3-O-rhamnoside were produced in UDP-glucose and TDP-rhamnose biosynthesis systems respectively, after 48 h of incubation in 3 L fermentor while supplementing 0.9 g of fisetin. These yields of fisetin glycosides represent ~99% of bioconversion of exogenously supplemented fisetin. The systems were also found to be highly effective in bio-transforming other flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin) into their respective glycosides, achieving over 95% substrate conversion. CONCLUSION: The construction of a synthetic expression vector for bacterial cell factory followed by subsequent re-direction of metabolic flux towards desirable products have always been revolutionized the biotechnological processes and technologies. This multi-monocistronic synthetic vector in a microbial platform is customizable to defined task and would certainly be useful for applications in producing and modifying such therapeutically valued plant secondary metabolites.
TI  - Rational design of a synthetic Entner-Doudoroff pathway for improved and controllable NADPH regeneration.
AB  - NADPH is an essential cofactor for the biosynthesis of several high-value chemicals, including isoprenoids, fatty acid-based fuels, and biopolymers. Tunable control over all potentially rate-limiting steps, including the NADPH regeneration rate, is crucial to maximizing production titers. We have rationally engineered a synthetic version of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway from Zymomonas mobilis that increased the NADPH regeneration rate in Escherichia coli MG1655 by 25-fold. To do this, we combined systematic design rules, biophysical models, and computational optimization to design synthetic bacterial operons expressing the 5-enzyme pathway, while eliminating undesired genetic elements for maximum expression control. NADPH regeneration rates from genome-integrated pathways were estimated using a NADPH-binding fluorescent reporter and by the productivity of a NADPH-dependent terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. We designed and constructed improved pathway variants by employing the RBS Library Calculator to efficiently search the 5-dimensional enzyme expression space and by performing 40 cycles of MAGE for site-directed genome mutagenesis. 624 pathway variants were screened using a NADPH-dependent blue fluorescent protein, and 22 were further characterized to determine the relationship between enzyme expression levels and NADPH regeneration rates. The best variant exhibited 25-fold higher normalized mBFP levels when compared to wild-type strain. Combining the synthetic Entner-Doudoroff pathway with an optimized terpenoid pathway further increased the terpenoid titer by 97%.
TI  - [Transformation of phosphotransferase system in Escherichia coli].
AB  - We constructed several recombinant Escherichia coli strains to transform phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS system) and compared the characteristics of growth and metabolism of the mutants. We knocked-out the key genes ptsI and ptsG in PTS system by using Red homologous recombination in E. coli and meanwhile we also knocked-in the glucose facilitator gene glf from Zymomonas mobilis in the E. coli chromosome. Recombinant E. coli strains were constructed and the effects of cell growth, glucose consumption and acetic acid accumulation were also evaluated in all recombinant strains. The deletion of gene ptsG and ptsI inactivated some PTS system functions and inhibited the growth ability of the cell. Expressing the gene glf can help recombinant E. coli strains re-absorb the glucose through Glf-Glk (glucose facilitator-glucokinase) pathway as it can use ATP to phosphorylate glucose and transport into cell. This pathway can improve the availability of glucose and also reduce the accumulation of acetic acid; it can also broaden the carbon flux in the metabolism pathway.
TI  - Construction of allitol synthesis pathway by multi-enzyme coexpression in Escherichia coli and its application in allitol production.
AB  - An engineered strain for the conversion of D-fructose to allitol was developed by constructing a multi-enzyme coupling pathway and cofactor recycling system in Escherichia coli. D-Psicose-3-epimerase from Ruminococcus sp. and ribitol dehydrogenase from Klebsiella oxytoca were coexpressed to form the multi-enzyme coupling pathway for allitol production. The cofactor recycling system was constructed using the formate dehydrogenase gene from Candida methylica for continuous NADH supply. The recombinant strain produced 10.62 g/l allitol from 100 mM D-fructose. To increase the intracellular concentration of the substrate, the glucose/fructose facilitator gene from Zymomonas mobilis was incorporated into the engineered strain. The results showed that the allitol yield was enhanced significantly to 16.53 g/l with a conversion rate of 92 %. Through optimizing conversion conditions, allitol was produced effectively on a large scale by the whole-cell biotransformation system; the yield reached 48.62 g/l when 500 mM D-fructose was used as the substrate.
TI  - Fusion of pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase increases ethanol production in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Ethanol is an important biofuel. Heterologous expression of Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhB) increases ethanol production in Escherichia coli. A fusion of PDC and ADH was generated and expressed in E. coli. The fusion enzyme was demonstrated to possess both activities. AdhB activity was significantly lower when fused to PDC than when the two enzymes were expressed separately. However, cells expressing the fusion protein generated ethanol more rapidly and to higher levels than cells coexpressing Pdc and AdhB, suggesting a specific rate enhancement due to the fusion of the two enzymes.
TI  - Pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase overexpression in Escherichia coli resulted in high ethanol production and rewired metabolic enzyme networks.
AB  - Pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase are efficient enzymes for ethanol production in Zymomonas mobilis. These two enzymes were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, a promising candidate for industrial ethanol production, resulting in high ethanol production in the engineered E. coli. To investigate the intracellular changes to the enzyme overexpression for homoethanol production, 2-DE and LC-MS/MS were performed. More than 1,000 protein spots were reproducibly detected in the gel by image analysis. Compared to the wild-type, 99 protein spots showed significant changes in abundance in the recombinant E. coli, in which 46 were down-regulated and 53 were up-regulated. Most proteins related to tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycerol metabolism and other energy metabolism were up-regulated, whereas proteins involved in glycolysis and glyoxylate pathway were down-regulated, indicating the rewired metabolism in the engineered E. coli. As glycolysis is the main pathway for ethanol production, and it was inhibited significantly in engineered E. coli, further efforts should be directed at minimizing the repression of glycolysis to optimize metabolism network for higher yields of ethanol production.
TI  - Autotransporter mediated esterase display on Zymomonas mobilis and Zymobacter palmae.
AB  - Autodisplay, i.e. surface expression of recombinant proteins by virtue of the autotransporter secretion pathway, has been used predominantly with Escherichia coli as host organism, which often limits the applicability of this technique to laboratory purposes and scales. The aim of this study was to investigate if the fermentative bacteria Zymomonas mobilis and Zymobacter palmae, representing attractive candidates for industrial applications, can serve as host organisms for autodisplay. We therefore used the carboxylesterase EstA from Burkholderia gladioli as an autotransporter passenger to display it on the surfaces of Z. palmae and Z. mobilis. Expression and outer membrane localization of the EstA-autotransporter fusion protein were verified by SDS-PAGE, and surface display of the enzyme was demonstrated by ELISA and flow cytometer analysis. Whole-cell activity assays revealed that EstA retained its activity on the cell surface. Recombinant Z. palmae cells exhibited significant higher esterase activity (294mU/mL/OD 1) in comparison to Z. mobilis (88mU/mL/OD 1) and the control E. coli (113mU/mL/OD 1). This appears even more noteworthy, as about 30% of EstA was released from the cell surface of Z. palmae. Nevertheless, our results indicate that both species are suitable autodisplay hosts, in particular Z. palmae for displaying esterase, opening up new horizons for biocatalytic applications.
TI  - Extracellular secretion of beta-glucosidase in ethanologenic E. coli enhances ethanol fermentation of cellobiose.
AB  - Consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose for ethanol production is realized by expressing cellulase enzymes on ethanologenic strain. In this study, an ethanologenic Escherichia coli ZY81 was constructed by integrating pyruvate decarboxylase gene pdc and alcohol dehydrogenase gene adhB from Zymomonas mobilis into the genome of E. coli JM109 to obtain the capability of ethanol production. Then, the beta-glucosidase gene bglB from Bacillus polymyxa was cloned and secretively expressed in E. coli ZY81. The recombinant strain E. coli ZY81/bglB showed an obvious activity of beta-glucosidase in extracellular location with more than half in periplasmic space. EDTA was found to promote the release of the periplasmic proteins by approximately tenfold. E. coli ZY81/bglB utilized cellobiose as sole carbon source for ethanol production with 33.99 % of theoretical yield.
TI  - Zymomonas mobilis: a novel platform for future biorefineries.
AB  - Biosynthesis of liquid fuels and biomass-based building block chemicals from microorganisms have been regarded as a competitive alternative route to traditional. Zymomonas mobilis possesses a number of desirable characteristics for its special Entner-Doudoroff pathway, which makes it an ideal platform for both metabolic engineering and commercial-scale production of desirable bio-products as the same as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on consideration of future biomass biorefinery. Z. mobilis has been studied extensively on both fundamental and applied level, which will provide a basis for industrial biotechnology in the future. Furthermore, metabolic engineering of Z. mobilis for enhancing bio-ethanol production from biomass resources has been significantly promoted by different methods (i.e. mutagenesis, adaptive laboratory evolution, specific gene knock-out, and metabolic engineering). In addition, the feasibility of representative metabolites, i.e. sorbitol, bionic acid, levan, succinic acid, isobutanol, and isobutanol produced by Z. mobilis and the strategies for strain improvements are also discussed or highlighted in this paper. Moreover, this review will present some guidelines for future developments in the bio-based chemical production using Z. mobilis as a novel industrial platform for future biofineries.
TI  - Studying the rapid bioconversion of lignocellulosic sugars into ethanol using high cell density fermentations with cell recycle.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Rapid Bioconversion with Integrated recycle Technology (RaBIT) process reduces capital costs, processing times, and biocatalyst cost for biochemical conversion of cellulosic biomass to biofuels by reducing total bioprocessing time (enzymatic hydrolysis plus fermentation) to 48 h, increasing biofuel productivity (g/L/h) twofold, and recycling biocatalysts (enzymes and microbes) to the next cycle. To achieve these results, RaBIT utilizes 24-h high cell density fermentations along with cell recycling to solve the slow/incomplete xylose fermentation issue, which is critical for lignocellulosic biofuel fermentations. Previous studies utilizing similar fermentation conditions showed a decrease in xylose consumption when recycling cells into the next fermentation cycle. Eliminating this decrease is critical for RaBIT process effectiveness for high cycle counts. RESULTS: Nine different engineered microbial strains (including Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, Scheffersomyces (Pichia) stipitis strains, Zymomonas mobilis 8b, and Escherichia coli KO11) were tested under RaBIT platform fermentations to determine their suitability for this platform. Fermentation conditions were then optimized for S. cerevisiae GLBRCY128. Three different nutrient sources (corn steep liquor, yeast extract, and wheat germ) were evaluated to improve xylose consumption by recycled cells. Capacitance readings were used to accurately measure viable cell mass profiles over five cycles. CONCLUSION: The results showed that not all strains are capable of effectively performing the RaBIT process. Acceptable performance is largely correlated to the specific xylose consumption rate. Corn steep liquor was found to reduce the deleterious impacts of cell recycle and improve specific xylose consumption rates. The viable cell mass profiles indicated that reduction in specific xylose consumption rate, not a drop in viable cell mass, was the main cause for decreasing xylose consumption.
TI  - Expression of a xylose-specific transporter improves ethanol production by metabolically engineered Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis is a promising organism for biofuel production as it can produce ethanol from glucose at high rates. However, Z. mobilis does not natively ferment C5 sugars such as xylose. While it has been engineered to do so, the engineered strains do not metabolize these sugars at high rates. Previous research has identified some of the bottlenecks associated with xylose metabolism in Z. mobilis. In this work, we investigated transport as a possible bottleneck. In particular, we hypothesized that the slow uptake of xylose through the promiscuous Glf transporter may limit the efficiency of xylose metabolism in Z. mobilis. To test this hypothesis, we expressed XylE, the low-affinity xylose transporter from Escherichia coli, in a xylose-utilizing strain of Z. mobilis. Our results show that the expression of this pentose-specific transporter improves the rate of xylose utilization in Z. mobilis; however, this enhancement is seen only at high xylose concentrations. In addition, we also found that overexpression of the promiscuous Z. mobilis transporter Glf yielded similar results, suggesting that the transport bottleneck is not due to the specificity, but rather the capacity for sugar uptake.
TI  - pZMO7-Derived shuttle vectors for heterologous protein expression and proteomic applications in the ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis has attracted considerable scientific and commercial interest due to its exceptional physiological properties. Shuttle vectors derived from native plasmids have previously been successfully used for heterologous gene expression in this bacterium for a variety of purposes, most notably for metabolic engineering applications. RESULTS: A quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach was used to determine the copy numbers of two endogenous double stranded DNA plasmids: pZMO1A (1,647 bp) and pZMO7 (pZA1003; 4,551 bp) within the NCIMB 11163 strain of Z. mobilis. Data indicated pZMO1A and pZMO7 were present at ca. 3-5 and ca. 1-2 copies per cell, respectively. A ca. 1,900 bp fragment from plasmid pZMO7 was used to construct two Escherichia coli - Z. mobilis shuttle vectors (pZ7C and pZ7-184). The intracellular stabilities and copy numbers of pZ7C and pZ7-184 were characterized within the NCIMB 11163, ATCC 29191 and (ATCC 10988-derived) CU1 Rif2 strains of Z. mobilis. Both shuttle vectors could be stably maintained within the ATCC 29191 strain (ca. 20-40 copies per cell), and the CU1 Rif2 strain (ca. 2-3 copies per cell), for more than 50 generations in the absence of an antibiotic selectable marker. A selectable marker was required for shuttle vector maintenance in the parental NCIMB 11163 strain; most probably due to competition for replication with the endogenous pZMO7 plasmid molecules. N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusions of four endogenous proteins, namely the acyl-carrier protein (AcpP); 2-dehydro-3-deoxyphosphooctonate aldolase (KdsA); DNA polymerase III chi subunit (HolC); and the RNA chaperone protein Hfq; were successfully expressed from pZ7C-derived shuttle vectors, and their protein-protein binding interactions were analyzed in Z. mobilis ATCC 29191. Using this approach, proteins that co-purified with AcpP and KdsA were identified. CONCLUSIONS: We show that a shuttle vector-based protein affinity 'pull-down' approach can be used to probe protein interaction networks in Z. mobilis cells. Our results demonstrate that protein expression plasmids derived from pZMO7 have significant potential for use in future biological or biotechnological applications within Z. mobilis.
TI  - On the role of the appended P19 element in type A RNAs of bacterial RNase P.
AB  - Comparative in silico analyses of bacterial RNase P enzymes clustered their RNA subunits in type A RNA, found in Escherichia coli, and in type B, found in Bacillus subtilis. Zymomonas mobilis RNase P consists of one protein (Zmo-RnpA) and one type A RNA (RPR) subunit containing the P19 element, present in many RNase P RNAs of any structure class but lacking in the E. coli RNase P RNA. To investigate the putative role of the P19 stem, we constructed a P19 deletion RNA mutant (DeltaP19RPR) and performed detailed kinetic analysis of reconstituted enzymes in the presence of the homologous Zmo-RnpA protein or Eco-RnpA protein from E. coli. The deletion of P19 perturbs the monovalent ion requirements. The Mg(2+) requirement for the DeltaP19RPR holoenzyme was almost identical to that for the wtRPR holoenzyme at Mg(2+) concentrations of </=25 mM. Interestingly, enzymes reconstituted with Eco-RnpA protein, relative to those assembled with Zmo-RnpA, exhibited enhanced activity in the presence of DeltaP19RPR, suggesting that Eco-RnpA protein can effectively replace its Z. mobilis counterpart. Homologous and heterologous reconstituted enzymes in the presence of DeltaP19RPR exhibited differences in their Km values and catalytic efficacies. Overall, the presence of the P19 stem points toward an adaption during the co-evolution of Zmo-RnpA and RPR that is essential for stabilizing the overall structure of the Z. mobilis RNase P. Finally, our results are in line with existing structural data on RNase P enzymes and provide biochemical support for the possible role of appended domains in RNase P RNA subunits.
TI  - Robustness of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 as a host for ethanol biosynthesis.
AB  - Expansion of the burgeoning biofuels agenda involves not only the design of suitable genetic and metabolic devices but also their deployment into suitable hosts that can endure the stress brought about by the products themselves. The microorganisms that are easiest to genetically manipulate for these endeavors (e.g. Escherichia coli) are often afflicted by an undesirable sensitivity to the very product that they are engineered to synthesize. In this context, we have examined the resistance to the stress arising from ethanol synthesis and/or its addition to cultures of recombinant Pseudomonas putida, using as a benchmark the same trait in an E. coli strain. To this end, ethanologenic strains of these two species were constructed by functionally expressing pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase) and adhB (alcohol dehydrogenase) from Zymomonas mobilis. Recombinants were compared under anoxic conditions as ethanol producers, and cell survival, stress resistance, and phenotypic stability were quantified in each case. P. putida consistently outperformed E. coli in every ethanol tolerance test conducted - whether the alcohol was produced endogenously or added exogenously. These results highlight the value of this bacterium as a microbial cell factory for the production of biofuels owing to its naturally pre-evolved ability to withstand different kinds of chemical stresses.
TI  - [Construction of an ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain expressing beta-glucosidase].
AB  - Constructing ethanologenic strains with cellulose activity is important to achieve consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose for ethanol production. In this study, we integrated the pyruvate decarboxylase gene pdc and alcohol dehydrogenase gene adhB from Zymomonas mobilis ZM4 into Escherichia coli JM109 by Red recombination method to generatea recombinant strain E. coli P81 that could produce ethanol from glucose. Abeta-glucosidase gene bglB from Bacillus polymyxa 1.794 was cloned into the recombinant E. coli P81 and beta-glucosidase was expressed to give a new recombinant strain E. coli P81 (pUC19-bglB) with dual functions of cellobiose degradation and ethanol production. The extracellular beta-glucosidaseactivity was 84.78 mU/mL broth and the extracellular cellobiase activity of E. coli P81 (pUC19-bglB) was 32.32 mU/mL broth. E. coli P81 (pUC19-bglB) fermented cellobiose to ethanol with a yield of 55.8% of the theoretical value, and when glucose and cellobiose were co-fermented, the ethanol yield reached 46.5% of thetheoretical value. The construction of consolidated bioprocessing strain opens the possibility to convert cellobiose to ethanol in a single bioprocess.
TI  - [Recombinant expression, purification and characterization of a novel DyP-type peroxidase in Escherichia coli].
AB  - Dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP-type peroxidase) represents a group of heme-containing peroxidases able to decolour various organic dyes, most of which are xenobiotics. To identify and characterize a new DyP-type peroxidase (ZmDyP) from Zymomonas mobilis ZM4 (ATCC 31821), ZmDyP was amplified from the genomic DNA of Z. mobilis by PCR, and cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET-21b(+). Alignment of the amino acid sequence of ZmDyP with other members of the DyP-type peroxidases revealed the presence of the active site conserved residues D149, R239, T254, F256 as well as the typical GXXDG motif, indicating that ZmDyP is a new member of the Dyp-type peroxidase family. pET-21b(+) containing ZmDyP gene was expressed in E. coli by IPTG induction. The expressed enzyme was purified by Ni-Chelating chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified enzyme revealed a molecular weight of 36 kDa, whereas activity staining gave a molecular weight of 108 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme could be a trimer. In addition, ZmDyP is a heme-containing enzyme as shown by a typical heme absorption peak of Soret band. Moreover, ZmDyP showed high catalytic efficiency with 2, 2'-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) as a substrate. These results enrich the pool of DyP-type peroxidases and lay a foundation for further studies.
TI  - Systematic approach to engineer Escherichia coli pathways for co-utilization of a glucose-xylose mixture.
AB  - Glucose and xylose are two major sugars of lignocellulosic hydrolysate. The regulatory program of catabolite repression in Escherichia coli dictates the preferred utilization of glucose over xylose, which handicaps the development of the lignocellulose-based fermentation process. To co-utilize a glucose-xylose mixture, the E. coli strain was manipulated by pathway engineering in a systematic way. The approach included (1) blocking catabolite repression, (2) enhancing glucose transport, (3) increasing the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway, and (4) eliminating undesirable pathways. Moreover, the ethanol synthetic pathway from Zymomonas mobilis was introduced into the engineered strain. As a consequence, the resulting strain was able to simultaneously metabolize glucose and xylose and consume all sugars (30 g/L each) in 16 h, leading to 97% of the theoretical ethanol yield. Overall, this indicates that this approach is effective and straightforward to engineer E. coli for the desired trait.
TI  - Inhibition of growth of Zymomonas mobilis by model compounds found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the pretreatment of biomass feedstocks and subsequent conditioning prior to saccharification, many toxic compounds are produced or introduced which inhibit microbial growth and in many cases, production of ethanol. An understanding of the toxic effects of compounds found in hydrolysate is critical to improving sugar utilization and ethanol yields in the fermentation process. In this study, we established a useful tool for surveying hydrolysate toxicity by measuring growth rates in the presence of toxic compounds, and examined the effects of selected model inhibitors of aldehydes, organic and inorganic acids (along with various cations), and alcohols on growth of Zymomonas mobilis 8b (a ZM4 derivative) using glucose or xylose as the carbon source. RESULTS: Toxicity strongly correlated to hydrophobicity in Z. mobilis, which has been observed in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for aldehydes and with some exceptions, organic acids. We observed Z. mobilis 8b to be more tolerant to organic acids than previously reported, although the carbon source and growth conditions play a role in tolerance. Growth in xylose was profoundly inhibited by monocarboxylic organic acids compared to growth in glucose, whereas dicarboxylic acids demonstrated little or no effects on growth rate in either substrate. Furthermore, cations can be ranked in order of their toxicity, Ca++ > > Na+ > NH4+ > K+. HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural), furfural and acetate, which were observed to contribute to inhibition of Z. mobilis growth in dilute acid pretreated corn stover hydrolysate, do not interact in a synergistic manner in combination. We provide further evidence that Z. mobilis 8b is capable of converting the aldehydes furfural, vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and to some extent syringaldehyde to their alcohol forms (furfuryl, vanillyl, 4-hydroxybenzyl and syringyl alcohol) during fermentation. CONCLUSIONS: Several key findings in this report provide a mechanism for predicting toxic contributions of inhibitory components of hydrolysate and provide guidance for potential process development, along with potential future strain improvement and tolerance strategies.
TI  - Use of an EZ-Tn5-based random mutagenesis system to create a Zymomonas mobilis with significant tolerance to heat stress and malnutrition.
AB  - During ethanol production, the fermentation cells are always exposed to stresses  like high temperature and low nutritional conditions, which affect their growth and productivity. Stress-tolerant strains with high ethanol yield are highly desirable. Therefore, a recombinant Zymomonas mobilis (Z. mobilis) designated as HYM was constructed by integrating three genes (yfdZ, metB, and Pfu-sHSP) into the genome of Z. mobilis CP4 (CP4) via Tn5 transposon in the present study. The yfdZ and metB genes from E. coli were used to decrease the nutritional requirement. The small heat shock protein gene (Pfu-sHSP) from Pyrococcus furiosus (P. furiosus) was used to increase the heat tolerance. The genomic integration of three genes confers on Z. mobilis the ability to grow in simple chemical defined medium without the addition of amino acid. The HYM not only demonstrated the high tolerance to unfavorable lower nutrition stresses but also the capability of converting glucose to ethanol with high yield at higher temperature. What is more, these genetic characteristics were stable up to 100 generations on nonselective medium. The effects of glucose concentration, fermentation temperature, and initial pH on ethanol production of the mutant strain HYM were optimized using a Box-Behnken design (BBD) experiment. The integration of three genes led to a significant increase in ethanol production by 9 % compared with its original Z. mobilis counterpart. The maximum ethanol production of HYM was as high as 105 g/l.
TI  - Use of a Tn5-based transposon system to create a cost-effective Zymomonas mobilis for ethanol production from lignocelluloses.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current methods of ethanol production from lignocelluloses generate a mixture of sugars, primarily glucose and xylose; the fermentation cells are always exposed to stresses like high temperature and low nutritional conditions that affect their growth and productivity. Stress-tolerant strains capable of using both glucose and xylose to produce ethanol with high yield are highly desirable. RESULTS: A recombinant Zymomonas mobilis (Z. mobilis) designated as HYMX was constructed by integrating seven genes (Pfu-sHSP, yfdZ, metB, xylA, xylB, tktA and talB) into the genome of Z. mobilis CP4 (CP4) via Tn5 transposon in the present study. The small heat shock protein gene (Pfu-sHSP) from Pyrococcus furious (P. furious) was used to increase the heat-tolerance, the yfdZ and metB genes from E. coli were used to decrease the nutritional requirement. To overcome the bottleneck of CP4 being unable to use pentose, xylose catabolic genes (xylA, xylB, tktA and talB) from E. coli were integrated into CP4 also for construction of the xylose utilizing metabolic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic integration confers on Z. mobilis the ability to grow in medium containing xylose as the only carbon source, and to grow in simple chemical defined medium without addition of amino acid. The HYMX demonstrated not only the high tolerance to unfavorable stresses like high temperature and low nutrient, but also the capability of converting both glucose and xylose to ethanol with high yield at high temperature. What's more, these genetic characteristics were stable up to 100 generations on nonselective medium. Although significant improvements were achieved, yeast extract is needed for ethanol production.
TI  - Impact of expression of EMP enzymes on glucose metabolism in Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis is the only known microorganism that utilizes the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway anaerobically. In this work, we investigated whether the overexpression of a phosphofructokinase (PFK), the only missing Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway enzyme, could establish the pathway in this organism. Introduction of a pyrophosphate-dependent PFK, along with co-expression of homologous fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and triosephosphate isomerase, did not result in an EMP flux to any appreciable level. However, the metabolism of glucose was impacted significantly. Eight percent of glucose was metabolized to form a new metabolite, dihydroxyacetone. Reducing flux through the ED pathway by as much as 40 % through antisense of a key enzyme, ED aldolase, did not result in a fully functional EMP pathway, suggesting that the ED pathway, especially the lower arm, downstream from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, is very rigid, possibly due to redox balance.
TI  - Indirect and suboptimal control of gene expression is widespread in bacteria.
AB  - Gene regulation in bacteria is usually described as an adaptive response to an environmental change so that genes are expressed when they are required. We instead propose that most genes are under indirect control: their expression responds to signal(s) that are not directly related to the genes' function. Indirect control should perform poorly in artificial conditions, and we show that gene regulation is often maladaptive in the laboratory. In Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, 24% of genes are detrimental to fitness in some conditions, and detrimental genes tend to be highly expressed instead of being repressed when not needed. In diverse bacteria, there is little correlation between when genes are important for optimal growth or fitness and when those genes are upregulated. Two common types of indirect control are constitutive expression and regulation by growth rate; these occur for genes with diverse functions and often seem to be suboptimal. Because genes that have closely related functions can have dissimilar expression patterns, regulation may be suboptimal in the wild as well as in the laboratory.
TI  - Surface display of a redox enzyme and its site-specific wiring to gold electrodes.
AB  - The generation of a current through interaction between bacteria and electrodes has been explored by various methods. We demonstrate the attachment of living bacteria through a surface displayed redox enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase II. The unnatural amino acid para-azido-L-phenylalanine was incorporated into a specific site of the displayed enzyme, facilitating electron transfer between the enzyme and an electrode. In order to attach the bacteria carrying the surface displayed enzyme to a surface, a linker containing an alkyne and a thiol moiety on opposite ends was synthesized and attached to the dehydrogenase site specifically through a copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Using this approach we were able to covalently link bacteria to gold-coated surfaces and to gold nanoparticles, while maintaining viability and catalytic activity. We show the performance of a biofuel cell using these modified bacteria at the anode, which resulted in site-specific dependent fuel cell performance for at least a week. This is the first example of site-specific attachment of a true living biohybrid to inorganic material.
TI  - Engineering an anaerobic metabolic regime in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for the anoxic biodegradation of 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene.
AB  - Pseudomonas putida KT2440, a microbial cell factory of reference for industrial whole-cell biocatalysis, is unable to support biochemical reactions that occur under anoxic conditions, limiting its utility for a large number of relevant biotransformations. Unlike (facultative) anaerobes, P. putida resorts to NADH oxidation via an oxic respiratory chain and completely lacks a true fermentation metabolism. Therefore, it cannot achieve the correct balances of energy and redox couples (i.e., ATP/ADP and NADH/NAD(+)) that are required to sustain an O(2)-free lifestyle. To overcome this state of affairs, the acetate kinase (ackA) gene of the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli and the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) genes of the aerotolerant Zymomonas mobilis were knocked-in to a wild-type P. putida strain. Biochemical and genetic assays showed that conditional expression of the entire enzyme set allowed the engineered bacteria to adopt an anoxic regime that maintained considerable metabolic activity. The resulting strain was exploited as a host for the heterologous expression of a 1,3-dichloroprop-1-ene degradation pathway recruited from Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170, enabling the recombinants to degrade this recalcitrant chlorinated compound anoxically. These results underscore the value of P. putida as a versatile agent for biotransformations able to function at progressively lower redox statuses.
TI  - Transcriptome profiling of Zymomonas mobilis under ethanol stress.
AB  - BACKGROUND: High tolerance to ethanol is a desirable characteristics for ethanologenic strains used in industrial ethanol fermentation. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanologenic strains tolerance of ethanol stress may guide the design of rational strategies to increase process performance in industrial alcoholic production. Many extensive studies have been performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. However, the physiological basis and genetic mechanisms involved in ethanol tolerance for Zymomonas mobilis are poorly understood on genomic level. To identify the genes required for tolerance to ethanol, microarray technology was used to investigate the transcriptome profiling of the ethanologenic Z. mobilis in response to ethanol stress. RESULTS: We successfully identified 127 genes which were differentially expressed in response to ethanol. Ethanol up- or down-regulated genes related to cell wall/membrane biogenesis, metabolism, and transcription. These genes were classified as being involved in a wide range of cellular processes including carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, respiratory chain, terpenoid biosynthesis, DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, transport, transcriptional regulation, some universal stress response, etc. CONCLUSION: In this study, genome-wide transcriptional responses to ethanol were investigated for the first time in Z. mobilis using microarray analysis.Our results revealed that ethanol had effects on multiple aspects of cellular metabolism at the transcriptional level and that membrane might play important roles in response to ethanol. Although the molecular mechanism involved in tolerance and adaptation of ethanologenic strains to ethanol is still unclear, this research has provided insights into molecular response to ethanol in Z. mobilis. These data will also be helpful to construct more ethanol resistant strains for cellulosic ethanol production in the future.
TI  - Heterologous expression of plant cell wall degrading enzymes for effective production of cellulosic biofuels.
AB  - A major technical challenge in the cost-effective production of cellulosic biofuel is the need to lower the cost of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCDE), which is required for the production of sugars from biomass. Several competitive, low-cost technologies have been developed to produce PCDE in different host organisms such as Escherichia coli, Zymomonas mobilis, and plant. Selection of an ideal host organism is very important, because each host organism has its own unique features. Synthetic biology-aided tools enable heterologous expression of PCDE in recombinant E. coli or Z. mobilis and allow successful consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) in these microorganisms. In-planta expression provides an opportunity to simplify the process of enzyme production and plant biomass processing and leads to self-deconstruction of plant cell walls. Although the future of currently available technologies is difficult to predict, a complete and viable platform will most likely be available through the integration of the existing approaches with the development of breakthrough technologies.
TI  - Recruiting alternative glucose utilization pathways for improving succinate production.
AB  - The phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP): carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) of Escherichia coli was usually inactivated to increase PEP supply for succinate production. However, cell growth and glucose utilization rate decreased significantly with PTS inactivation. In this work, two glucose transport proteins and two glucokinases (Glk) from E. coli and Zymomonas mobilis were recruited in PTS(-) strains, and their impacts on glucose utilization and succinate production were compared. All PTS(-) strains recruiting Z. mobilis glucose facilitator Glf had higher glucose utilization rates than PTS(-) strains using E. coli galactose permease (GalP), which was suggested to be caused by higher glucose transport velocity and lower energetic cost of Glf. The highest rate obtained by combinatorial modulation of glf and glk E. coli (2.13 g/L*h) was 81 % higher than the wild-type E. coli and 30 % higher than the highest rate obtained by combinatorial modulation of galP and glk E. coli . On the other hand, although glucokinase activities increased after replacing E. coli Glk with isoenzyme of Z. mobilis, glucose utilization rate decreased to 0.58 g/L*h, which was assumed due to tight regulation of Z. mobilis Glk by energy status of the cells. For succinate production, using GalP led to a 20 % increase in succinate productivity, while recruiting Glf led to a 41 % increase. These efficient alternative glucose utilization pathways obtained in this work can also be used for production of many other PEP-derived chemicals, such as malate, fumarate, and aromatic compounds.
TI  - From lin-benzoguanines to lin-benzohypoxanthines as ligands for Zymomonas mobilis tRNA-guanine transglycosylase: replacement of protein-ligand hydrogen bonding by importing water clusters.
AB  - The foodborne illness shigellosis is caused by Shigella bacteria that secrete the highly cytotoxic Shiga toxin, which is also formed by the closely related enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). It has been shown that tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is essential for the pathogenicity of Shigella flexneri. Herein, the molecular recognition properties of a guanine binding pocket in Zymomonas mobilis TGT are investigated with a series of lin-benzohypoxanthine- and lin-benzoguanine-based inhibitors that bear substituents to occupy either the ribose-33 or the ribose-34 pocket. The three inhibitor scaffolds differ by the substituent at C(6) being H, NH(2), or NH-alkyl. These differences lead to major changes in the inhibition constants, pK(a) values, and binding modes. Compared to the lin-benzoguanines, with an exocyclic NH(2) at C(6), the lin-benzohypoxanthines without an exocyclic NH(2) group have a weaker affinity as several ionic protein-ligand hydrogen bonds are lost. X-ray cocrystal structure analysis reveals that a new water cluster is imported into the space vacated by the lacking NH(2) group and by a conformational shift of the side chain of catalytic Asp102. In the presence of an N-alkyl group at C(6) in lin-benzoguanine ligands, this water cluster is largely maintained but replacement of one of the water molecules in the cluster leads to a substantial loss in binding affinity. This study provides new insight into the role of water clusters at enzyme active sites and their challenging substitution by ligand parts, a topic of general interest in contemporary structure-based drug design.
TI  - Ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass by recombinant Escherichia coli strain FBR5.
AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass, upon pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, generates a  mixture of hexose and pentose sugars such as glucose, xylose, arabinose and galactose. While Escherichia coli utilizes all these sugars it lacks the ability to produce ethanol from them. Recombinant ethanologenic E. coli strains have been created with a goal to produce ethanol from both hexose and pentose sugars. Herein, we review the current state of the art on the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates by an ethanologenic recombinant E. coli strain (FBR5). The bacterium is stable without antibiotics and can tolerate ethanol up to 50 gL(-1). It produces up to 45 g ethanol per L and has the potential to be used for industrial production of ethanol from lignocellulosic hydrolyzates.
TI  - Implantation of unmarked regulatory and metabolic modules in Gram-negative bacteria with specialised mini-transposon delivery vectors.
AB  - Engineering of robust and safe microbial cell factories requires genetic tools somewhat different from those traditionally used for laboratory-adapted microorganisms. We took advantage of the properties of broad-host-range mini-Tn5 vectors and two regulated expression systems (LacI(Q)/P(trc) and XylS/Pm), together with FRT-flanked, excisable antibiotic resistance determinants, to generate a set of vectors for the delivery of gene(s) into the chromosome of Gram-negative bacteria. This arrangement of modular elements allows the cloning and subsequent markerless insertion of expression cargoes and leaves behind an antibiotic-sensitive host upon the action of the yeast Flp recombinase. We engineered a Pseudomonas putida KT2440 Pm::gfp strain that displayed strong fluorescence upon exposure to 3-methylbenzoate, a XylS effector, and allowed us to examine the performance of the Pm promoter at the single cell level. We also reconstructed a device for sugar transport and phosphorylation in Escherichia coli independent of the native phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system by the stable implantation of genes derived from the obligate anaerobe Zymomonas mobilis. In both cases, the information carried by the implanted genes was stably inherited in the absence of any selective pressure. Deliverable expression systems such as those described here will enhance the applicability of various Gram-negative bacteria in biocatalysis and environmental bioremediation.
TI  - Ethanol production from wood hydrolysate using genetically engineered Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - An ethanologenic microorganism capable of fermenting all of the sugars released from lignocellulosic biomass through a saccharification process is essential for secondary bioethanol production. We therefore genetically engineered the ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis such that it efficiently produced bioethanol from the hydrolysate of wood biomass containing glucose, mannose, and xylose as major sugar components. This was accomplished by introducing genes encoding mannose and xylose catabolic enzymes from Escherichia coli. Integration of E. coli manA into Z. mobilis chromosomal DNA conferred the ability to co-ferment mannose and glucose, producing 91 % of the theoretical yield of ethanol within 36 h. Then, by introducing a recombinant plasmid harboring the genes encoding E. coli xylA, xylB, tal, and tktA, we broadened the range of fermentable sugar substrates for Z. mobilis to include mannose and xylose as well as glucose. The resultant strain was able to ferment a mixture of 20 g/l glucose, 20 g/l mannose, and 20 g/l xylose as major sugar components of wood hydrolysate within 72 h, producing 89.8 % of the theoretical yield. The recombinant Z. mobilis also efficiently fermented actual acid hydrolysate prepared from cellulosic feedstock containing glucose, mannose, and xylose. Moreover, a reactor packed with the strain continuously produced ethanol from acid hydrolysate of wood biomass from coniferous trees for 10 days without accumulation of residual sugars. Ethanol productivity was at 10.27 g/l h at a dilution rate of 0.25 h(-1).
TI  - Increase in furfural tolerance in ethanologenic Escherichia coli LY180 by plasmid-based expression of thyA.
AB  - Furfural is an inhibitory side product formed during the depolymerization of hemicellulose by mineral acids. Genomic libraries from three different bacteria (Bacillus subtilis YB886, Escherichia coli NC3, and Zymomonas mobilis CP4) were screened for genes that conferred furfural resistance on plates. Beneficial plasmids containing the thyA gene (coding for thymidylate synthase) were recovered from all three organisms. Expression of this key gene in the de novo pathway for dTMP biosynthesis improved furfural resistance on plates and during fermentation. A similar benefit was observed by supplementation with thymine, thymidine, or the combination of tetrahydrofolate and serine (precursors for 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, the methyl donor for ThyA). Supplementation with deoxyuridine provided a small benefit, and deoxyribose was of no benefit for furfural tolerance. A combination of thymidine and plasmid expression of thyA was no more effective than either alone. Together, these results demonstrate that furfural tolerance is increased by approaches that increase the supply of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides. However, ThyA activity was not directly affected by the addition of furfural. Furfural has been previously shown to damage DNA in E. coli and to activate a cellular response to oxidative damage in yeast. The added burden of repairing furfural-damaged DNA in E. coli would be expected to increase the cellular requirement for dTMP. Increased expression of thyA (E. coli, B. subtilis, or Z. mobilis), supplementation of cultures with thymidine, and supplementation with precursors for 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (methyl donor) are each proposed to increase furfural tolerance by increasing the availability of dTMP for DNA repair.
TI  - Biochemical and molecular characterization of NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase from the ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - An isocitrate dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fused protein (ZmIDH). The molecular mass of recombinant ZmIDH, together with its 6x His partner, was estimated to be 74 kDa by gel filtration chromatography, suggesting a homodimeric structure. The purified recombinant ZmIDH displayed maximal activity at 55 degrees C, pH 8.0 with Mn(2+) and pH 8.5 with Mg(2+). Heat inactivation studies showed that the recombinant ZmIDH was rapidly inactivated above 40 degrees C. In addition, the recombinant ZmIDH activity was completely dependent on the divalent cation and Mn(2+) was the most effective cation. The recombinant ZmIDH displayed a 165-fold (k(cat)/K(m)) preference for NAD(+) over NADP(+) with Mg(2+), and a 142-fold greater specificity for NAD(+) than NADP(+) with Mn(2+). Therefore, the recombinant ZmIDH has remarkably high coenzyme preference for NAD(+). The catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of the recombinant ZmIDH was found to be much lower than that of its NADP(+)-dependent counterparts. The poor performance of the recombinant ZmIDH in decarboxylating might be improved by protein engineering techniques, thus making ZmIDH a potential genetic modification target for the development of optimized Z. mobilis strains.
TI  - Optical mapping and sequencing of the Escherichia coli KO11 genome reveal extensive chromosomal rearrangements, and multiple tandem copies of the Zymomonas mobilis pdc and adhB genes.
AB  - Escherichia coli KO11 (ATCC 55124) was engineered in 1990 to produce ethanol by chromosomal insertion of the Zymomonas mobilis pdc and adhB genes into E. coli W (ATCC 9637). KO11FL, our current laboratory version of KO11, and its parent E. coli W were sequenced, and contigs assembled into genomic sequences using optical NcoI restriction maps as templates. E. coli W contained plasmids pRK1 (102.5 kb) and pRK2 (5.4 kb), but KO11FL only contained pRK2. KO11FL optical maps made with AflII and with BamHI showed a tandem repeat region, consisting of at least 20 copies of a 10-kb unit. The repeat region was located at the insertion site for the pdc, adhB, and chloramphenicol-resistance genes. Sequence coverage of these genes was about 25-fold higher than average, consistent with amplification of the foreign genes that were inserted as circularized DNA. Selection for higher levels of chloramphenicol resistance originally produced strains with higher pdc and adhB expression, and hence improved fermentation performance, by increasing the gene copy number. Sequence data for an earlier version of KO11, ATCC 55124, indicated that multiple copies of pdc adhB were present. Comparison of the W and KO11FL genomes showed large inversions and deletions in KO11FL, mostly enabled by IS10, which is absent from W but present at 30 sites in KO11FL. The early KO11 strain ATCC 55124 had no rearrangements, contained only one IS10, and lacked most accumulated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present in KO11FL. Despite rearrangements and SNPs in KO11FL, fermentation performance was equal to that of ATCC 55124.
TI  - Ethanol production by continuous fermentation of D-(+)-cellobiose, D-(+)-xylose and sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate using the thermoanaerobe Caloramator boliviensis.
AB  - The recently isolated anaerobic bacterium Caloramator boliviensis with an optimum growth temperature of 60 degrees C can efficiently convert hexoses and pentoses into ethanol. When fermentations of pure sugars and a pentose-rich sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate were carried out in a packed bed reactor with immobilized cells of C. boliviensis, more than 98% of substrates were converted. Ethanol yields of 0.40-0.46 g/g of sugar were obtained when sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate was fermented. These features reveal interesting properties of C. boliviensis in producing ethanol from a renewable feedstock.
TI  - A scalable microfluidic chip for bacterial suspension culture.
AB  - Microfluidic systems could, in principle, enable high-throughput breeding and screening of microbial strains for industrial applications, but parallel and scalable culture and detection chips are needed before complete microbial selection systems can be integrated and tested. Here we demonstrate a scalable multi-channel chip that is capable of bacterial suspension culture. The key invention is a multi-layered chip design, which enables a single set of control channels to function as serial peristaltic pumps to drive parallel culture chamber loops. Such design leads to scalability of the culture chip. We demonstrate that E. coli growth in the chip is equivalent or superior to conventional suspension culture on shaking beds. The chip could also be used for suspension culture of other microbes such as Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas stutzeri, and Zymomonas mobilis, indicating its general applicability for bacterial suspension culture.
TI  - Engineering yield and rate of reductive biotransformation in Escherichia coli by  partial cyclization of the pentose phosphate pathway and PTS-independent glucose transport.
AB  - Optimization of yields and productivities in reductive whole-cell biotransformations is an important issue for the industrial application of such processes. In a recent study with Escherichia coli, we analyzed the reduction of the prochiral beta-ketoester methyl acetoacetate by an R-specific alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to the chiral hydroxy ester (R)-methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate (MHB) using glucose as substrate for the generation of NADPH. Deletion of the phosphofructokinase gene pfkA almost doubled the yield to 4.8 mol MHB per mole of glucose, and it was assumed that this effect was due to a partial cyclization of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Here, this partial cyclization was confirmed by (13)C metabolic flux analysis, which revealed a negative net flux from glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase. For further process optimization, the genes encoding the glucose facilitator (glf) and glucokinase (glk) of Zymomonas mobilis were overexpressed in recombinant E. coli strains carrying ADH and deletions of either pgi (phosphoglucose isomerase), or pfkA, or pfkA plus pfkB. In all cases, the glucose uptake rate was increased (30-47%), and for strains Deltapgi and DeltapfkA also, the specific MHB production rate was increased by 15% and 20%, respectively. The yield of the latter two strains slightly dropped by 11% and 6%, but was still 73% and 132% higher compared to the reference strain with intact pgi and pfkA genes and expressing glf and glk. Thus, metabolic engineering strategies are presented for improving yield and rate of reductive redox biocatalysis by partial cyclization of the PPP and by increasing glucose uptake, respectively.
TI  - Functional characterization of a putative beta-lactamase gene in the genome of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis ZM4 is resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics but there are no reports of a beta-lactam resistance gene and its regulation. A putative beta-lactamase gene sequence (ZMO0103) in the genome of Z. mobilis showed a 55% amino acid sequence identity with class C beta-lactamase genes. qPCR analysis of the beta-lactamase transcript indicated a higher level expression of the beta-lactamase compared to the relative transcript quantities in antibiotic-susceptible bacteria. The putative beta-lactamase gene was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and the product, AmpC, was purified to homogeneity. Its optimal activity was at pH 6 and 30 degrees C. Further, the beta-lactamase had a higher affinity towards penicillins than cephalosporin antibiotics.
TI  - De novo biosynthesis of biodiesel by Escherichia coli in optimized fed-batch cultivation.
AB  - Biodiesel is a renewable alternative to petroleum diesel fuel that can contribute to carbon dioxide emission reduction and energy supply. Biodiesel is composed of fatty acid alkyl esters, including fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), and is currently produced through the transesterification reaction of methanol (or ethanol) and triacylglycerols (TAGs). TAGs are mainly obtained from oilseed plants and microalgae. A sustainable supply of TAGs is a major bottleneck for current biodiesel production. Here we report the de novo biosynthesis of FAEEs from glucose, which can be derived from lignocellulosic biomass, in genetically engineered Escherichia coli by introduction of the ethanol-producing pathway from Zymomonas mobilis, genetic manipulation to increase the pool of fatty acyl-CoA, and heterologous expression of acyl-coenzyme A: diacylglycerol acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi. An optimized fed-batch microbial fermentation of the modified E. coli strain yielded a titer of 922 mg L(-1) FAEEs that consisted primarily of ethyl palmitate, -oleate, -myristate and -palmitoleate.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for improving L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) synthesis from glucose.
AB  - L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is an aromatic compound employed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Metabolic engineering was applied to generate Escherichia coli strains for the production of L-DOPA from glucose by modifying the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) and aromatic biosynthetic pathways. Carbon flow was directed to the biosynthesis of L-tyrosine (L-Tyr), an L-DOPA precursor, by transforming strains with compatible plasmids carrying genes encoding a feedback-inhibition resistant version of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, transketolase, the chorismate mutase domain from chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase from E. coli and cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis. The effects on L-Tyr production of PTS inactivation (PTS(-) gluc(+) phenotype), as well as inactivation of the regulatory protein TyrR, were evaluated. PTS inactivation caused a threefold increase in the specific rate of L-Tyr production (q( L-Tyr)), whereas inactivation of TyrR caused 1.7- and 1.9-fold increases in q( L-Tyr) in the PTS(+) and the PTS(-) gluc(+) strains, respectively. An 8.6-fold increase in L-Tyr yield from glucose was observed in the PTS(-) gluc(+) tyrR (-) strain. Expression of hpaBC genes encoding the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from E. coli W in the strains modified for L-Tyr production caused the synthesis of L-DOPA. One of such strains, having the PTS(-) gluc(+) tyrR (-) phenotype, displayed the best production parameters in minimal medium, with a specific rate of L-DOPA production of 13.6 mg/g/h, L-DOPA yield from glucose of 51.7 mg/g and a final L-DOPA titer of 320 mg/l. In a batch fermentor culture in rich medium this strain produced 1.51 g/l of L-DOPA in 50 h.
TI  - [Metabolic engineering for microbial production of ethanol from xylose: a review].
AB  - Discovery of an efficient bioconversion of cellulosic biomass and its hydrolysis  to ethanol is the key to unlocking in developing of a bioethanol industry. The lack of industrially suitable microorganisms to convert xylose to ethanol fuel has been cited as a major technical bottleneck. In the past decades, many improvements have been made in the metabolic engineering of microorganisms, including Zymomonas mobilis, Escherichia coli, and yeasts, for the fermentation of xylose to produce ethanol by introducing genes for either xylose metabolism or ethanol production. The history and the current progress in constructing these strains are presented in this review.
TI  - Extension of the substrate utilization range of Ralstonia eutropha strain H16 by  metabolic engineering to include mannose and glucose.
AB  - The gram-negative facultative chemolithoautotrophic bacterium Ralstonia eutropha  strain H16 is known for its narrow carbohydrate utilization range, which limits its use for biotechnological production of polyhydroxyalkanoates and possibly other products from renewable resources. To broaden its substrate utilization range, which is for carbohydrates and related compounds limited to fructose, N-acetylglucosamine, and gluconate, strain H16 was engineered to use mannose and glucose as sole carbon sources for growth. The genes for a facilitated diffusion protein (glf) from Zymomonas mobilis and for a glucokinase (glk), mannofructokinase (mak), and phosphomannose isomerase (pmi) from Escherichia coli were alone or in combination constitutively expressed in R. eutropha strain H16 under the control of the neokanamycin or lac promoter, respectively, using an episomal broad-host-range vector. Recombinant strains harboring pBBR1MCS-3::glf::mak::pmi or pBBR1MCS-3::glf::pmi grew on mannose, whereas pBBR1MCS-3::glf::mak and pBBR1MCS-3::glf did not confer the ability to utilize mannose as a carbon source to R. eutropha. The recombinant strain harboring pBBR1MCS-3::glf::pmi exhibited slower growth on mannose than the recombinant strain harboring pBBR1MCS-3::glf::mak::pmi. These data indicated that phosphomannose isomerase is required to convert mannose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate for subsequent catabolism via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. In addition, all plasmids also conferred to R. eutropha the ability to grow in the presence of glucose. The best growth was observed with a recombinant R. eutropha strain harboring plasmid pBBR1MCS-2::P(nk)::glk::glf. In addition, expression of the respective enzymes was demonstrated at the transcriptional and protein levels and by measuring the activities of mannofructokinase (0.622 +/- 0.063 U mg(-1)), phosphomannose isomerase (0.251 +/- 0.017 U mg(-1)), and glucokinase (0.518 +/- 0.040 U mg(-1)). Cells of recombinant strains of R. eutropha synthesized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) to ca. 65 to 67% (wt/wt) of the cell dry mass in the presence of 1% (wt/vol) glucose or mannose as the sole carbon sources.
TI  - The genome-scale metabolic network analysis of Zymomonas mobilis ZM4 explains physiological features and suggests ethanol and succinic acid production strategies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zymomonas mobilis ZM4 is a Gram-negative bacterium that can efficiently produce ethanol from various carbon substrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. However, systems metabolic engineering is required to further enhance its metabolic performance for industrial application. As an important step towards this goal, the genome-scale metabolic model of Z. mobilis is required to systematically analyze in silico the metabolic characteristics of this bacterium under a wide range of genotypic and environmental conditions. RESULTS: The genome-scale metabolic model of Z. mobilis ZM4, ZmoMBEL601, was reconstructed based on its annotated genes, literature, physiological and biochemical databases. The metabolic model comprises 579 metabolites and 601 metabolic reactions (571 biochemical conversion and 30 transport reactions), built upon extensive search of existing knowledge. Physiological features of Z. mobilis were then examined using constraints-based flux analysis in detail as follows. First, the physiological changes of Z. mobilis as it shifts from anaerobic to aerobic environments (i.e. aerobic shift) were investigated. Then the intensities of flux-sum, which is the cluster of either all ingoing or outgoing fluxes through a metabolite, and the maximum in silico yields of ethanol for Z. mobilis and Escherichia coli were compared and analyzed. Furthermore, the substrate utilization range of Z. mobilis was expanded to include pentose sugar metabolism by introducing metabolic pathways to allow Z. mobilis to utilize pentose sugars. Finally, double gene knock-out simulations were performed to design a strategy for efficiently producing succinic acid as another example of application of the genome-scale metabolic model of Z. mobilis. CONCLUSION: The genome-scale metabolic model reconstructed in this study was able to successfully represent the metabolic characteristics of Z. mobilis under various conditions as validated by experiments and literature information. This reconstructed metabolic model will allow better understanding of Z. mobilis metabolism and consequently designing metabolic engineering strategies for various biotechnological applications.
TI  - Enabling unbalanced fermentations by using engineered electrode-interfaced bacteria.
AB  - Cellular metabolism is a series of tightly linked oxidations and reductions that  must be balanced. Recycling of intracellular electron carriers during fermentation often requires substrate conversion to undesired products, while respiration demands constant addition of electron acceptors. The use of electrode-based electron acceptors to balance biotransformations may overcome these constraints. To test this hypothesis, the metal-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis was engineered to stoichiometrically convert glycerol into ethanol, a biotransformation that will not occur unless two electrons are removed via an external reaction, such as electrode reduction. Multiple modules were combined into a single plasmid to alter S. oneidensis metabolism: a glycerol module, consisting of glpF, glpK, glpD, and tpiA from Escherichia coli, and an ethanol module containing pdc and adh from Zymomonas mobilis. A further increase in product yields was accomplished through knockout of pta, encoding phosphate acetyltransferase, shifting flux toward ethanol and away from acetate production. In this first-generation demonstration, conversion of glycerol to ethanol required the presence of an electrode to balance the reaction, and electrode-linked rates were on par with volumetric conversion rates observed in engineered E. coli. Linking microbial biocatalysis to current production can eliminate redox constraints by shifting other unbalanced reactions to yield pure products and serve as a new platform for next-generation bioproduction strategies.
TI  - Cellulosic ethanol production by Zymomonas mobilis harboring an endoglucanase gene from Enterobacter cloacae.
AB  - Enterobactercloacae was isolated from the gut of the wood feeding termite, Heterotermes indicola, and a 2.25-kb fragment conferring cellulase activity was cloned in Escherichia coli. The cloned fragment contained a 1083-bp ORF which could encode a protein belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 8. The cellulase gene was introduced into Zymomonas mobilis strain Microbial Type Culture Collection centre (MTCC) on a plasmid and 0.134 filter paper activity unit (FPU)/ml units of cellulase activity was observed with the recombinant bacterium. Using carboxymethyl cellulose and 4% NaOH pretreated bagasse as substrates, the recombinant strain produced 5.5% and 4% (V/V) ethanol respectively, which was threefold higher than the amount obtained with the original E.cloacae isolate. The recombinant Z. mobilis strain could be improved further by simultaneous expression of cellulase cocktails before utilizing it for industrial level ethanol production.
TI  - Genome-scale modeling and in silico analysis of ethanologenic bacteria Zymomonas  mobilis.
AB  - Bioethanol has been recognized as a potential alternative energy source. Among various ethanol-producing microbes, Zymomonas mobilis has acquired special attention due to its higher ethanol yield and tolerance. However, cellular metabolism in Z. mobilis remains unclear, hindering its practical application for bioethanol production. To elucidate such physiological characteristics, we reconstructed and validated a genome-scale metabolic network (iZM363) of Z. mobilis ATCC31821 (ZM4) based on its annotated genome and biochemical information. The phenotypic behaviors and metabolic states predicted by our genome-scale model were highly consistent with the experimental observations of Z. mobilis ZM4 strain growing on glucose as well as NMR-measured intracellular fluxes of an engineered strain utilizing glucose, fructose, and xylose. Subsequent comparative analysis with Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as gene essentiality and flux coupling analyses have also confirmed the functional role of pdc and adh genes in the ethanologenic activity of Z. mobilis, thus leading to better understanding of this natural ethanol producer. In future, the current model could be employed to identify potential cell engineering targets, thereby enhancing the productivity of ethanol in Z. mobilis.
TI  - Simultaneous consumption of pentose and hexose sugars: an optimal microbial phenotype for efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass.
AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive carbon source for bio-based fuel and chemical production; however, its compositional heterogeneity hinders its commercial use. Since most microbes possess carbon catabolite repression (CCR), mixed sugars derived from the lignocellulose are consumed sequentially, reducing the efficacy of the overall process. To overcome this barrier, microbes that exhibit the simultaneous consumption of mixed sugars have been isolated and/or developed and evaluated for the lignocellulosic biomass utilization. Specific strains of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Zymomonas mobilis have been engineered for simultaneous glucose and xylose utilization via mutagenesis or introduction of a xylose metabolic pathway. Other microbes, such as Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, and Candida shehatae possess a relaxed CCR mechanism, showing simultaneous consumption of glucose and xylose. By exploiting CCR-negative phenotypes, various integrated processes have been developed that incorporate both enzyme hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material and mixed sugar fermentation, thereby enabling greater productivity and fermentation efficacy.
TI  - Adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli inactivated in the phosphotransferase system operon improves co-utilization of xylose and glucose under anaerobic conditions.
AB  - Modification of the phosphoenolpyruvate/sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) has shown improvement in sugar coassimilation in Escherichia coli production strains. However, in preliminary experiments under anaerobic conditions, E. coli strains with an inactive PTS and carrying pLOI1594, which encodes pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis, were unable to grow. These PTS(-) strains were previously evolved under aerobic conditions to grow rapidly in glucose (PTS(-) Glucose+ phenotype). Thus, in this work, applying a continuous culture strategy under anaerobic conditions, we generate a new set of evolved PTS(-) Glucose+ mutants, VH30N1 to VH30N6. Contrary to aerobically evolved mutants, strains VH30N2 and VH30N4 carrying pLOI1594 grew in anaerobiosis; also, their growth capacity was restored in a 100%, showing specific growth rates (mu ~ 0.12 h(-)(1)) similar to the PTS+ parental strain (mu = 0.11 h(-)(1)). In cultures of VH30N2/pLOI1594 and VH30N4/pLOI1594 using a glucose-xylose mixture, xylose was totally consumed and consumption of sugars occurred in a simultaneous manner indicating that catabolic repression is alleviated in these strains. Also, the efficient sugar coassimilation by the evolved strains caused an increment in the ethanol yields.
TI  - Comparing the fermentation performance of Escherichia coli KO11, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 424A(LNH-ST) and Zymomonas mobilis AX101 for cellulosic ethanol production.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermentations using Escherichia coli KO11, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 424A(LNH-ST), and Zymomonas mobilis AX101 are compared side-by-side on corn steep liquor (CSL) media and the water extract and enzymatic hydrolysate from ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX)-pretreated corn stover. RESULTS: The three ethanologens are able produce ethanol from a CSL-supplemented co-fermentation at a metabolic yield, final concentration and rate greater than 0.42 g/g consumed sugars, 40 g/L and 0.7 g/L/h (0-48 h), respectively. Xylose-only fermentation of the tested ethanologenic bacteria are five to eight times faster than 424A(LNH-ST) in the CSL fermentation.All tested strains grow and co-ferment sugars at 15% w/v solids loading equivalent of ammonia fiber explosion (AFEX)-pretreated corn stover water extract. However, both KO11 and 424A(LNH-ST) exhibit higher growth robustness than AX101. In 18% w/w solids loading lignocellulosic hydrolysate from AFEX pretreatment, complete glucose fermentations can be achieved at a rate greater than 0.77 g/L/h. In contrast to results from fermentation in CSL, S. cerevisiae 424A(LNH-ST) consumed xylose at the greatest extent and rate in the hydrolysate compared to the bacteria tested. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that glucose fermentations among the tested strains are effective even at high solids loading (18% by weight). However, xylose consumption in the lignocellulosic hydrolysate is the major bottleneck affecting overall yield, titer or rate of the process. In comparison, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 424A(LNH-ST) is the most relevant strains for industrial production for its ability to ferment both glucose and xylose from undetoxified and unsupplemented hydrolysate from AFEX-pretreated corn stover at high yield.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a ribitol dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Ribitol dehydrogenase (RDH) catalyzes the conversion of ribitol to D-ribulose. A  novel RDH gene was cloned from Zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis ZM4 and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). DNA sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 795 bp, capable of encoding a polypeptide of 266 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 28,426 Da. The gene was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and the protein was purified as an active soluble form using glutathione S-transferase affinity chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be approximately 28 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and approximately 58 KDa with gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that the enzyme is a homodimer. The enzyme had an optimal pH and temperature of 9.5 and 65 degrees C, respectively. Unlike previously characterized RDHs, Z. mobilis RDH (ZmRDH) showed an unusual dual coenzyme specificity, with a k(cat) of 4.83 s(-1) for NADH (k(cat)/K(m) = 27.3 s(-1) mM(-1)) and k(cat) of 2.79 s(-1) for NADPH (k(cat)/K(m) = 10.8 s(-1) mM(-1)). Homology modeling and docking studies of NAD+ and NADP+ into the active site of ZmRDH shed light on the dual coenzyme specificity of ZmRDH.
TI  - An evolved xylose transporter from Zymomonas mobilis enhances sugar transport in  Escherichia coli.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xylose is a second most abundant sugar component of lignocellulose besides glucose. Efficient fermentation of xylose is important for the economics of biomass-based biorefineries. However, sugar mixtures are sequentially consumed in xylose co-fermentation with glucose due to carbon catabolite repression (CCR) in microorganisms. As xylose transmembrance transport is one of the steps repressed by CCR, it is therefore of interest to develop a transporter that is less sensitive to the glucose inhibition or CCR. RESULTS: The glucose facilitator protein Glf transporter from Zymomonas mobilis, also an efficient transporter for xylose, was chosen as the target transporter for engineering to eliminate glucose inhibition on xylose uptake. The evolution of Glf transporter was carried out with a mixture of glucose and xylose in E. coli. Error-prone PCR and random deletion were employed respectively in two rounds of evolution. Aided by a high-throughput screening assay using xylose analog p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside (pNPX) in 96-well plates, a best mutant 2-RD5 was obtained that contains several mutations, and a deletion of 134 residues (about 28% of total residues), or three fewer transmembrane sections (TMSs). It showed a 10.8-fold improvement in terms of pNPX transport activity in the presence of glucose. The fermentation performance results showed that this mutant improved xylose consumption by 42% with M9 minimal medium containing 20 g L-1 xylose only, while with the mixture sugar of xylose and glucose, 28% more glucose was consumed, but no obvious co-utilization of xylose was observed. Further glucose fed-batch experiments suggested that the intracellular metabolism of xylose was repressed by glucose. CONCLUSIONS: Through random mutagenesis and partial deletion coupled with high-throughput screening, a mutant of the Glf transporter (2-RD5) was obtained that relieved the inhibition of xylose transport by glucose. The fermentation tests revealed that 2-RD5 was advantageous in xylose and glucose uptakes, while no obvious advantage was seen for xylose co-consumption when co-fermented with glucose. Further efforts could focus on reducing CCR-mediated repression of intracellular metabolism of xylose. Glf should also serve as a useful model to further exploit the molecular mechanism of xylose transport and the CCR-mediated inhibition.
TI  - Engineering of bio-hybrid materials by electrospinning polymer-microbe fibers.
AB  - Although microbes have been used in industrial and niche applications for several decades, successful immobilization of microbes while maintaining their usefulness for any desired application has been elusive. Such a functionally bioactive system has distinct advantages over conventional batch and continuous-flow microbial reactor systems that are used in various biotechnological processes. This article describes the use of polyethylene oxide(99)-polypropylene oxide(67)-polyethylene oxide(99) triblock polymer fibers, created via electrospinning, to encapsulate microbes of 3 industrially relevant genera, namely, Pseudomonas, Zymomonas, and Escherichia. The presence of bacteria inside the fibers was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and SEM. Although the electrospinning process typically uses harsh organic solvents and extreme conditions that generally are harmful to bacteria, we describe techniques that overcome these limitations. The encapsulated microbes were viable for several months, and their metabolic activity was not affected by immobilization; thus they could be used in various applications. Furthermore, we have engineered a microbe-encapsulated cross-linked fibrous polymeric material that is insoluble. Also, the microbe-encapsulated active matrix permits efficient exchange of nutrients and metabolic products between the microorganism and the environment. The present results demonstrate the potential of the electrospinning technique for the encapsulation and immobilization of bacteria in the form of a synthetic biofilm, while retaining their metabolic activity. This study has wide-ranging implications in the engineering and use of novel bio-hybrid materials or biological thin-film catalysts.
TI  - Genetic engineering of Enterobacter asburiae strain JDR-1 for efficient production of ethanol from hemicellulose hydrolysates.
AB  - Dilute acid pretreatment is an established method for hydrolyzing the methylglucuronoxylans of hemicellulose to release fermentable xylose. In addition to xylose, this process releases the aldouronate methylglucuronoxylose, which cannot be metabolized by current ethanologenic biocatalysts. Enterobacter asburiae JDR-1, isolated from colonized wood, was found to efficiently ferment both methylglucuronoxylose and xylose in acid hydrolysates of sweet gum xylan, producing predominantly ethanol and acetate. Transformation of E. asburiae JDR-1 with pLOI555 or pLOI297, each containing the PET operon containing pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase B (adhB) genes derived from Zymomonas mobilis, replaced mixed-acid fermentation with homoethanol fermentation. Deletion of the pyruvate formate lyase (pflB) gene further increased the ethanol yield, resulting in a stable E. asburiae E1(pLOI555) strain that efficiently utilized both xylose and methylglucuronoxylose in dilute acid hydrolysates of sweet gum xylan. Ethanol was produced from xylan hydrolysate by E. asburiae E1(pLOI555) with a yield that was 99% of the theoretical maximum yield and at a rate of 0.11 g ethanol/g (dry weight) cells/h, which was 1.57 times the yield and 1.48 times the rate obtained with the ethanologenic strain Escherichia coli KO11. This engineered derivative of E. asburiae JDR-1 that is able to ferment the predominant hexoses and pentoses derived from both hemicellulose and cellulose fractions is a promising subject for development as an ethanologenic biocatalyst for production of fuels and chemicals from agricultural residues and energy crops.
TI  - Characterization of multiple promoters and transcript stability in the sacB-sacC  gene cluster in Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - In Zymomonas mobilis, the extracellular levansucrase (SacB) and extracellular sucrase (SacC) are involved in sucrose hydrolysis. Genes coding for these two enzymes (sacB and sacC) are arranged in a cluster in the genome and separated by a short intervening sequence. The level of sacC transcript was 12-fold higher than that of sacB transcript. On the other hand, transcript stability analysis in sucrose grown cultures revealed that the half-life of the sacB transcripts (153 s) was more than twofold higher than that of sacC transcript (66 s). The decay curves of sacB and sacC transcripts analyzed by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR correlated well with the decay curves of the respective enzyme activities. In the sacB promoter disruption mutant, Z. moblis BT2, the extracellular sucrase activity decreased from 2.6 to 2.0 U mg(-1) in sucrose medium due to the loss of SacB expression. The expression of sacC in the absence of the sacB promoter suggested that these two genes could be transcribed as different mRNAs. The promoter-lacZ fusion studies in Escherichia coli proved that the short intervening region acts as a strong promoter for the sacC gene.
TI  - Optimization of metabolic pathways for bioconversion of lignocellulose to ethanol through genetic engineering.
AB  - The optimization of metabolic pathways is of fundamental importance for strategies aimed at improving the economics and yield of the lignocellulose-to-ethanol processes. Although Escherichia coli is capable of metabolizing a wide variety of substrates including hexoses and pentoses, its hexose metabolism is inferior to that of Zymomonas mobilis, an obligate, ethanologenic bacterium. We therefore inserted and expressed Z. mobilis genes encoding essential enzymes involved in the fermentation pathway, alcohol dehydrogenase II (adh II) and pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc), into E. coli, resulting in increased cell growth and ethanol production. Ethanol concentrations of >30 g/L were obtained on 10% glucose. Additionally, since pyruvate is mainly assimilated through pyruvate formate lyase (pfl) and forms formic acid and acetyl coenzyme A, metabolic redirection was attempted through gene knockout by Red-mediated recombination to decrease the byproducts of pyruvate metabolism. Under microaerobic conditions, pflA- and pflB-mutants produced more ethanol (163% and 207%, respectively) relative to the parent strain, using glucose as a carbon source.
TI  - An in vivo, label-free quick assay for xylose transport in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Efficient use of xylose is necessary for economic production of biochemicals and  biofuels from lignocellulosic materials. Current studies on xylose uptake for various microorganisms have been hampered by the lack of a facile assay for xylose transport. In this work, a rapid in vivo, label-free method for measuring xylose transport in Escherichia coli was developed by taking advantage of the Bacillus pumilus xylosidase (XynB), which cleaved a commercially available xylose analog, p-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylopyranoside (pNPX), to release a chromogenic group, p-nitrophenol (pNP). XynB was expressed alone or in conjunction with a Zymomonas mobilis glucose facilitator protein (Glf) capable of transporting xylose. This XynB-mediated transport assay was demonstrated in test tubes and 96-well plates with submicromolar concentrations of pNPX. Kinetic inhibition experiments validated that pNPX and xylose were competitive substrates for the transport process, and the addition of glucose (20 g/L) in the culture medium clearly diminished the transmembrane transport of pNPX and, thus, mimicked its inhibitory action on xylose uptake. This method should be useful for engineering of the xylose transport process in E. coli, and similar assay schemes can be extended to other microorganisms.
TI  - Different biochemical mechanisms ensure network-wide balancing of reducing equivalents in microbial metabolism.
AB  - To sustain growth, the catabolic formation of the redox equivalent NADPH must be  balanced with the anabolic demand. The mechanisms that ensure such network-wide balancing, however, are presently not understood. Based on 13C-detected intracellular fluxes, metabolite concentrations, and cofactor specificities for all relevant central metabolic enzymes, we have quantified catabolic NADPH production in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Paracoccus versutus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Sinorhizobium meliloti, and Zymomonas mobilis. For six species, the estimated NADPH production from glucose catabolism exceeded the requirements for biomass synthesis. Exceptions were P. fluorescens, with balanced rates, and E. coli, with insufficient catabolic production, in which about one-third of the NADPH is supplied via the membrane-bound transhydrogenase PntAB. P. versutus and B. subtilis were the only species that appear to rely on transhydrogenases for balancing NADPH overproduction during growth on glucose. In the other four species, the main but not exclusive redox-balancing mechanism appears to be the dual cofactor specificities of several catabolic enzymes and/or the existence of isoenzymes with distinct cofactor specificities, in particular glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. An unexpected key finding for all species, except E. coli and B. subtilis, was the lack of cofactor specificity in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, which contrasts with the textbook view of the pentose phosphate pathway dehydrogenases as being NADP+ dependent.
TI  - Butanol tolerance in a selection of microorganisms.
AB  - Butanol tolerance is a critical factor affecting the ability of microorganisms to generate economically viable quantities of butanol. Current Clostridium strains are unable to tolerate greater than 2% 1-butanol thus membrane or gas stripping technologies to actively remove butanol during fermentation are advantageous. To evaluate the potential of alternative hosts for butanol production, we screened 24 different microorganisms for their tolerance to butanol. We found that in general, a barrier to growth exists between 1% and 2% butanol and few microorganisms can tolerate 2% butanol. Strains of Escherichia coli, Zymomonas mobilis, and non-Saccharomyces yeasts were unable to surmount the 2% butanol growth barrier. Several strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit limited growth in 2% butanol, while two strains of Lactobacillus were able to tolerate and grow in up to 3% butanol.
TI  - Enhanced levan production using chitin-binding domain fused levansucrase immobilized on chitin beads.
AB  - Levan is a homopolymer of fructose which can be produced by the transfructosylation reaction of levansucrase (EC 2.4.1.10) from sucrose. In particular, levan synthesized by Zymomonas mobilis has found a wide and potential application in the food and pharmaceutical industry. In this study, the immobilization of Z. mobilis levansucrae (encoded by levU) was attempted for repeated production of levan. By fusion levU with the chitin-binding domain (ChBD), the hybrid protein was overproduced in a soluble form in Escherichia coli. After direct absorption of the protein mixture from E. coli onto chitin beads, levansucrase tagged with ChBD was found to specifically attach to the affinity matrix. Subsequent analysis indicated that the linkage between the enzyme and chitin beads was substantially stable. Furthermore, with 20% sucrose, the production of levan was enhanced by 60% to reach 83 g/l using the immobilized levansucrase as compared to that by the free counterpart. This production yield accounts for 41.5% conversion yield (g/g) on the basis of sucrose. After all, a total production of levan with 480 g/l was obtained by recycling of the immobilized enzyme for seven times. It is apparent that this approach offers a promising way for levan production by Z. mobilis levansucrase immobilized on chitin beads.
TI  - Re-engineering Escherichia coli for ethanol production.
AB  - A lactate producing derivative of Escherichia coli KO11, strain SZ110, was re-engineered for ethanol production by deleting genes encoding all fermentative routes for NADH and randomly inserting a promoterless mini-Tn5 cassette (transpososome) containing the complete Zymomonas mobilis ethanol pathway (pdc, adhA, and adhB) into the chromosome. By selecting for fermentative growth in mineral salts medium containing xylose, a highly productive strain was isolated in which the ethanol cassette had been integrated behind the rrlE promoter, designated strain LY160(KO11, Deltafrd::celY(Ec) DeltaadhE DeltaldhA, DeltaackA lacA::casAB(Ko) rrlE::(pdc( Zm)-adhA(Zm)-adhB(Zm)-FRT-rrlE)pflB(+)). This strain fermented 9% (w/v) xylose to 4% (w/v) ethanol in 48 h in mineral salts medium, nearly equal to the performance of KO11 with Luria broth.
TI  - Immobilization of the recombinant invertase INVB from Zymomonas mobilis on Nylon-6.
AB  - The recombinant invertase INVB (re-INVB) from Zymomonas mobilis was immobilized on microbeads of Nylon-6, by means of covalent bonding. The enzyme was strongly and successfully bound to the support. The activity of the free and immobilized enzyme was determined, using 10% (w/v) sucrose, at a temperature ranging between 15 and 60 degrees C and a pH ranging between 3.5 and 7. The optimal pH and temperature for the immobilized enzyme were 5.5 and 25 degrees C, respectively. Immobilization of re-INVB on Nylon-6 showed no significant change in the optimal pH, but a difference in the optimal temperature was evident, as that for the free enzyme was shown to be 40 degrees C. The values for kinetic parameters were determined as: 984 and 98 mM for Kappm of immobilized and free re-INVB, respectively. Kappcat values for immobilized and free enzymes were 6.1x10(2) and 1.2x10(4) s(-1), respectively, and immobilized re-INVB showed Vappmax of 158.73 micromol h min(-1) mg(-1). Immobilization of re-INVB on Nylon-6 enhanced the thermostability of the enzyme by 50% at 30 degrees C and 70% at 40 degrees C, when compared to the free enzyme. The immobilization system reported here may have future biotechnological applications, owing to the simplicity of the immobilization technique, the strong binding of re-INVB to the support and the effective thermostability of the enzyme.
TI  - Expression, purification and immobilization of the intracellular invertase INVA,  from Zymomonas mobilis on crystalline cellulose and Nylon-6.
AB  - This paper presents two immobilization methods for the intracellular invertase (INVA), from Zymomonas mobilis. In the first method, a chimeric protein containing the invertase INVA, fused through its C-terminus to CBDCex from Cellulomonas fimi was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). INVA was purified and immobilized on crystalline cellulose (Avicel) by means of affinity, in a single step. No changes were detected in optimal pH and temperature when INVA-CBD was immobilized on Avicel, where values of 5.5 and 30 degrees C, respectively, were registered. The kinetic parameters of the INVA-CBD fusion protein were determined in both its free form and when immobilized on Avicel. Km and Vmax were affected with immobilization, since both showed an increase of up to threefold. Additionally, we found that subsequent to immobilization, the INVA-CBD fusion protein was 39% more susceptible to substrate inhibition than INVA-CBD in its free form. The second method of immobilization was achieved by the expression of a 6xHis-tagged invertase purified on Ni-NTA resin, which was then immobilized on Nylon-6 by covalent binding. An optimal pH of 5.5 and a temperature of 30 degrees C were maintained, subsequent to immobilization on Nylon-6 as well as with immobilization on crystalline cellulose. The kinetic parameters relating to Vmax increased up to 5.7-fold, following immobilization, whereas Km increased up to 1.7-fold. The two methods were compared showing that when invertase was immobilized on Nylon-6, its activity was 1.9 times that when immobilized on cellulose for substrate concentrations ranging from 30 to 390 mM of sucrose.
TI  - Construction of a novel cell-surface display system for heterologous gene expression in Escherichia coli by using an outer membrane protein of Zymomonas mobilis as anchor motif.
AB  - A novel bacterial cell-surface display system was developed in Escherichia coli using omp1, a hypothetical outer membrane protein of Zymomonas mobilis. By using this system, we successfully expressed beta-amylase gene of sweet potato in E. coli. The display of enzyme on the membrane surface was also confirmed. The recombinant beta-amylase showed to significantly increase hydrolytic activity toward soluble starch. Our results provide a basis for constructing an engineered Z. mobilis strain directly fermenting raw starch to produce ethanol.
TI  - The dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase of Aeromonas caviae ST exhibits NADH-dependent tellurite reductase activity.
AB  - Potassium tellurite (K(2)TeO(3)) is extremely toxic for most forms of life and only a limited number of organisms are naturally resistant to the toxic effects of this compound. Crude extracts prepared from the environmental isolate Aeromonas caviae ST catalize the in vitro reduction of TeO32- in a NADH-dependent reaction. Upon fractionation by ionic exchange column chromatography three major polypeptides identified as the E1, E2, and E3 components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex were identified in fractions exhibiting tellurite-reducing activity. Tellurite reductase and pyruvate dehydrogenase activities co-eluted from a Sephadex gel filtration column. To determine which component(s) of the PDH complex has tellurite reductase activity, the A. caviae ST structural genes encoding for E1 (aceE), E2 (aceF), and E3 (lpdA) were independently cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and their gene products purified. Results indicated that tellurite reductase activity lies almost exclusively in the E3 component, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. The E3 component of the PDH complex from E. coli, Zymomonas mobilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Geobacillus stearothermophilus also showed NADH-dependent tellurite reductase in vitro suggesting that this enzymatic activity is widely distributed among microorganisms.
TI  - Development of a versatile shuttle vector for gene expression in Geobacillus spp.
AB  - An improved, versatile shuttle vector has been created for the metabolic engineering of Geobacillus spp. As kanamycin is the most thermo-tolerant of commonly used antibiotics, the gene encoding a thermostable kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase, together with the origin of replication from the G. stearothermophilus plasmid pBST1 were cloned into the Escherichia coli cloning vector pUC18. The resulting vector, named pUCG18, replicated in both organisms and could be transformed with an efficiency of 1 x 10(4) transformants per microg of DNA in G. thermoglucosidasius and was stable up to 68 degrees C with antibiotic selection. It was used to demonstrate expression of the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) gene from Zymomonas palmae in G. thermoglucosidasius at 45 degrees C. Sequence analysis of the pBST1 derived origin of replication revealed homology with a family of theta replicons that have previously only been found in strains of Bacillus megaterium.
TI  - Metabolic regulation analysis of an ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain based on RT-PCR and enzymatic activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A metabolic regulation study was performed, based upon measurements of enzymatic activities, fermentation performance, and RT-PCR analysis of pathways related to central carbon metabolism, in an ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain (CCE14) derived from lineage C. In comparison with previous engineered strains, this E coli derivative has a higher ethanol production rate in mineral medium, as a result of the elevated heterologous expression of the chromosomally integrated genes encoding PDCZm and ADHZm (pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis). It is suggested that this behavior might be due to lineage differences between E. coli W and C. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that the glycolytic flux is controlled, in this case, by reactions outside glycolysis, i.e., the fermentative pathways. Changes in ethanol production rate in this ethanologenic strain result in low organic acid production rates, and high glycolytic and ethanologenic fluxes, that correlate with enhanced transcription and enzymatic activity levels of PDCZm and ADHZm. Furthermore, a higher ethanol yield (90% of the theoretical) in glucose-mineral media was obtained with CCE14 in comparison with previous engineered E. coli strains, such as KO11, that produces a 70% yield under the same conditions. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that a higher ethanol formation rate, caused by ahigher PDCZm and ADHZm activities induces a metabolic state that cells compensate through enhanced glucose transport, ATP synthesis, and NAD-NADH+H turnover rates. These results show that glycolytic enzymatic activities, present in E. coli W and C under fermentative conditions, are sufficient to contend with increases in glucose consumption and product formation rates.
TI  - Functional characterization of a putative endoglucanase gene in the genome of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The sequence of the putative endoglucanase gene ZMO1086 in the genome of Zymomonas mobilis showed a 40% similarity with known bacterial endoglucanase genes. The upstream region of this putative gene revealed the presence of characteristic promoter (-10 and -35 regions) and a Shine-Dalgarno region. The putative endoglucanase gene was poorly expressed from the native promoter of Z. mobilis and therefore the putative endoglucanase gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. The overexpressed gene product CelA was purified to homogeneity and the optimal activity was observed at 30 degrees C and pH 6 respectively.
TI  - Cloning, solubilization, and characterization of squalene synthase from Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1.
AB  - Squalene synthase (SQS) is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the condensation  of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to give presqualene diphosphate (PSPP) and the subsequent rearrangement of PSPP to squalene. These reactions constitute the first pathway-specific steps in hopane biosynthesis in Bacteria and sterol biosynthesis in Eukarya. The genes encoding SQS were isolated from the hopane-producing bacteria Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and Zymomonas mobilis and cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system. The expressed proteins with a His(6) tag were found exclusively in inclusion bodies when no additives were used in the buffer. After extensive optimization, soluble recombinant T. elongatus BP-1 SQS was obtained when cells were disrupted and purified in buffers containing glycerol. The recombinant B. japonicum and Z. mobilis SQSs could not be solubilized under any of the expression and purification conditions used. Purified T. elongatus His(6)-SQS gave a single band at 42 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular ion at m/z 41886 by electrospray mass spectrometry. Incubation with FPP and NADPH gave squalene as the sole product. Incubation of the enzyme with [(14)C]FPP in the absence of NADPH gave PSPP. The enzyme requires Mg(2+) for activity, has an optimum pH of 7.6, and is strongly stimulated by detergent. Under optimal conditions, the K(m) of FPP is 0.97 +/- 0.10 microM and the k(cat) is 1.74 +/- 0.04 s(-1). Zaragozic acid A, a potent inhibitor of mammalian, fungal, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae SQSs, also inhibited recombinant T. elongatus BP-1 SQS, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 95.5 +/- 13.6 nM.
TI  - Specific ethanol production rate in ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain KO11 Is limited by pyruvate decarboxylase.
AB  - Modification of ethanol productivity and yield, using mineral medium supplemented with glucose or xylose as carbon sources, was studied in ethanologenic Escherichia coli KO11 by increasing the activity of five key carbon metabolism enzymes. KO11 efficiently converted glucose or xylose to ethanol with a yield close to 100% of the theoretical maximum when growing in rich medium. However, when KO11 ferments glucose or xylose in mineral medium, the ethanol yields decreased to only 70 and 60%, respectively. An increase in GALP(Ec) (permease of galactose-glucose-xylose) or PGK(Ec) (phosphoglycerate kinase) activities did not change xylose or glucose and ethanol flux. However, when PDC(Zm) (pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis) activity was increased 7-fold, the yields of ethanol from glucose or xylose were increased to 85 and 75%, respectively, and organic acid formation rates were reduced. Furthermore, as a response to a reduction in acetate and ATP yield, and a limited PDC(Zm) activity, an increase in PFK(Ec) (phosphofructokinase) or PYK(Bs) (pyruvate kinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus) activity drastically reduced glucose or xylose consumption and ethanol formation flux. This experimental metabolic control analysis showed that ethanol flux in KO11 is negatively controlled by phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase, and positively influenced by the PDC(Zm) activity level.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for L-tyrosine production by expression of genes coding for the chorismate mutase domain of the native chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase and a cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The expression of the feedback inhibition-insensitive enzyme cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase (TyrC) from Zymomonas mobilis and the chorismate mutase domain from native chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase (PheA(CM)) from Escherichia coli was compared to the expression of native feedback inhibition-sensitive chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase (CM-TyrA(p)) with regard to the capacity to produce l-tyrosine in E. coli strains modified to increase the carbon flow to chorismate. Shake flask experiments showed that TyrC increased the yield of l-tyrosine from glucose (Y(l-Tyr/Glc)) by 6.8-fold compared to the yield obtained with CM-TyrA(p). In bioreactor experiments, a strain expressing both TyrC and PheA(CM) produced 3 g/liter of l-tyrosine with a Y(l-Tyr/Glc) of 66 mg/g. These values are 46 and 48% higher than the values for a strain expressing only TyrC. The results show that the feedback inhibition-insensitive enzymes can be employed for strain development as part of a metabolic engineering strategy for l-tyrosine production.
TI  - Analysis of the respiratory chain in Ethanologenic Zymomonas mobilis with a cyanide-resistant bd-type ubiquinol oxidase as the only terminal oxidase and its possible physiological roles.
AB  - The respiratory chain of the ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis was investigated, in which the pyruvate-to-ethanol pathway has been demonstrated to be mainly responsible for NADH oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is incomplete. Membranes from cells cultivated under aerobic or anaerobic growth conditions showed dehydrogenase and oxidase activities for NADH, D-lactate and D-glucose and ubiquinol oxidase activity. Intriguingly, the NADH oxidase activity level of membrane fractions from cells grown aerobically was found to be higher than that of membrane fractions from Escherichia coli or Pseudomonas putida grown aerobically, indicating a crucial role of the respiratory chain in NADH oxidation in the organism. Cyanide-resistant terminal oxidase activity was observed and appeared to be due to a bd-type ubiquinol oxidase as the only terminal oxidase encoded by the entire genome. The terminal oxidase with a relatively strong ubiquinol oxidase activity exhibited remarkably weak signals of cytochrome d. Considering these findings and the presence of a type-II NADH dehydrogenase but not a type-I, a simple respiratory chain that generates less energymay have evolved in Z. mobilis.
TI  - Improvement of P450(BM-3) whole-cell biocatalysis by integrating heterologous cofactor regeneration combining glucose facilitator and dehydrogenase in E. coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli BL21, expressing a quintuple mutant of P450(BM-3), oxyfunctionalizes alpha-pinene in an NADPH-dependent reaction to alpha-pinene oxide, verbenol, and myrtenol. We optimized the whole-cell biocatalyst by integrating a recombinant intracellular NADPH regeneration system through co-expression of a glucose facilitator from Zymomonas mobilis for uptake of unphosphorylated glucose and a NADP(+)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium that oxidizes glucose to gluconolactone. The engineered strain showed a nine times higher initial alpha-pinene oxide formation rate corresponding to a sixfold higher yield of 20 mg g(-1) cell dry weight after 1.5 h. The initial total product formation rate was 1,000 micromol h(-1) micromol(-1) P450 leading to a total of 32 mg oxidized products per gram cell of dry weight after 1.5 h. The physiological functioning of the heterologous cofactor regeneration system was illustrated by a sevenfold increased alpha-pinene oxide yield in the presence of glucose compared to glucose-free conditions.
TI  - An ethanol-tolerant recombinant Escherichia coli expressing Zymomonas mobilis pdc and adhB genes for enhanced ethanol production from xylose.
AB  - An ethanol-tolerant mutant, ET1, was isolated by an enrichment method from Escherichia coli JM109. Strains JM109 and ET1 were transformed with expression vector pZY507bc containing Zymomonas mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) and pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) genes, resulting in an ethanol-sensitive recombinant strain JMbc and an ethanol-tolerant recombinant strain, ET1bc. Alcohol dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase activities were 24 and 32% lower, respectively, in JMbc than in ET1bc. ET1bc fermented 10% (w/v) xylose to give 39.4 g ethanol/l (77%, theoretical yield), a 1.3-fold increase compared with the ethanol-sensitive strain JMbc.
TI  - Growth rate of a non-fermentative Escherichia coli strain is influenced by NAD+ regeneration.
AB  - By complementing a non-fermentative Escherichia coli (ldhA (-) pflB (-)) strain with the recombinant Zymomonas mobilis ethanol pathway (pdc, adhB), we evaluated the effect of different levels of enzymatic activity on growth rate demonstrating that there is a direct relationship between anaerobic growth rate and the total specific activity of pyruvate decarboxylase, which is the limiting enzyme of this specific fermentative NAD(+) regenerating pathway. This relationship was proved to be useful to establish a selection strategy based on growth rate for the analysis of lctE libraries, which encode lactate dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Biochemical characterization and phylogenetic analysis of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase from the gellan gum producer Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461.
AB  - Sphingomonas elodea ATCC 31461 synthesizes in high yield the exopolysaccharide gellan, which is a water-soluble gelling agent with many applications. In this study, we describe the cloning and sequence analysis of the ugdG gene, encoding a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (47.2 kDa; UDPG-DH; EC 1.1.1.22), required for the synthesis of the gellan gum precursor UDP-glucuronic acid. UgdG protein shows homology to members of the UDP-glucose/GDP-mannose dehydrogenase superfamily. The Neighbor-Joining method was used to determine phylogenetic relationships among prokaryotic and eukaryotic UDPG-DHs. UgdG from S. elodea and UDPG-DHs from Novosphingobium, Zymomonas, Agrobacterium, and Caulobacter species form a divergent phylogenetic group with a close evolutionary relationship with eukaryotic UDPG-DHs. The ugdG gene was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli with and N-terminal 6-His tag and purified for biochemical characterization. The enzyme has an optimum temperature and pH of 37 degrees C and 8.7, respectively. The estimated apparent K(m) values for UDP-glucose and NAD(+) were 0.87 and 0.4 mM, respectively. DNA sequencing of chromosomal regions adjacent to ugdG gene and sequence similarity studies suggests that this gene maps together with others presumably involved in the biosynthesis of S. elodea cell wall polysaccharides.
TI  - Asymmetric alkene reduction by yeast old yellow enzymes and by a novel Zymomonas  mobilis reductase.
AB  - The genes encoding yeast old yellow enzymes (OYE 1, 2, and 3) and NAD(P)H-dependent 2-cyclohexen-1-one reductase from Zymomonas mobilis (NCR) were expressed separately in Escherichia coli. All four recombinant strains reduced the carbon double bond in alpha,beta-unsaturated alkenals and alkenones, however rates and enantio-specificities differed. Which of the two possible enantiomers was predominantly formed, was not only dependent on the choice of enzyme but also on the substrate: In addition to a dependency on methylation in alpha- or beta-position, the data of this study illustrate that firstly the E- or Z-configuration (cis- or trans-) of the carbon double-bond and secondly the remainder of the substrate molecule play roles in determining enantio-specificity. Based on the currently accepted mechanism of flavin mediated anti-hydrogenation of the carbon double bond, the data in this study may be explained by a flipped orientation of some of the substrates in the active center of OYE.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Bacillus subtilis for ethanol production: lactate dehydrogenase plays a key role in fermentative metabolism.
AB  - Wild-type Bacillus subtilis ferments 20 g/liter glucose in 48 h, producing lactate and butanediol, but not ethanol or acetate. To construct an ethanologenic B. subtilis strain, homologous recombination was used to disrupt the native lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene (ldh) by chromosomal insertion of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (adhB) under the control of the ldh native promoter. The values of the intracellular PDC and ADHII enzymatic activities of the engineered B. subtilis BS35 strain were similar to those found in an ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain. BS35 produced ethanol and butanediol; however, the cell growth and glucose consumption rates were reduced by 70 and 65%, respectively, in comparison to those in the progenitor strain. To eliminate butanediol production, the acetolactate synthase gene (alsS) was inactivated. In the BS36 strain (BS35 delta alsS), ethanol production was enhanced, with a high yield (89% of the theoretical); however, the cell growth and glucose consumption rates remained low. Interestingly, kinetic characterization of LDH from B. subtilis showed that it is able to oxidize NADH and NADPH. The expression of the transhydrogenase encoded by udhA from E. coli allowed a partial recovery of the cell growth rate and an early onset of ethanol production. Beyond pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and NADH oxidation, an additional key physiological role of LDH for glucose consumption under fermentative conditions is suggested. Long-term cultivation showed that 8.9 g/liter of ethanol can be obtained using strain BS37 (BS35 delta alsS udhA+). As far as we know, this is the highest ethanol titer and yield reported with a B. subtilis strain.
TI  - Genetic engineering of Zymobacter palmae for production of ethanol from xylose.
AB  - Its metabolic characteristics suggest that Zymobacter palmae gen. nov., sp. nov.  could serve as a useful new ethanol-fermenting bacterium, but its biotechnological exploitation will require certain genetic modifications. We therefore engineered Z. palmae so as to broaden the range of its fermentable sugar substrates to include the pentose sugar xylose. The Escherichia coli genes encoding the xylose catabolic enzymes xylose isomerase, xylulokinase, transaldolase, and transketolase were introduced into Z. palmae, where their expression was driven by the Zymomonas mobilis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. When cultured with 40 g/liter xylose, the recombinant Z. palmae strain was able to ferment 16.4 g/liter xylose within 5 days, producing 91% of the theoretical yield of ethanol with no accumulation of organic acids as metabolic by-products. Notably, xylose acclimation enhanced both the expression of xylose catabolic enzymes and the rate of xylose uptake into recombinant Z. palmae, which enabled the acclimated organism to completely and simultaneously ferment a mixture of 40 g/liter glucose and 40 g/liter xylose within 8 h, producing 95% of the theoretical yield of ethanol. Thus, efficient fermentation of a mixture of glucose and xylose to ethanol can be accomplished by using Z. palmae expressing E. coli xylose catabolic enzymes.
TI  - Construction of an Escherichia coli K-12 mutant for homoethanologenic fermentation of glucose or xylose without foreign genes.
AB  - Conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks to ethanol requires microorganisms that  effectively ferment both hexose and pentose sugars. Towards this goal, recombinant organisms have been developed in which heterologous genes were added to platform organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, and Escherichia coli. Using a novel approach that relies only on native enzymes, we have developed a homoethanologenic alternative, Escherichia coli strain SE2378. This mutant ferments glucose or xylose to ethanol with a yield of 82% under anaerobic conditions. An essential mutation in this mutant was mapped within the pdh operon (pdhR aceEF lpd), which encodes components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Anaerobic ethanol production by this mutant is apparently the result of a novel pathway that combines the activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase (typically active during aerobic, oxidative metabolism) with the fermentative alcohol dehydrogenase.
TI  - [Progress on engineered strains for ethanol production].
AB  - With the 21 century's coming, the era of cheap oil is coming to the end. There has been an increasing worldwide interest in fuel ethanol. In the last two decades, lots of work has been done to develop strains for ethanol producing. Research progress on metabolic engineering of strains for fuel ethanol production is summarized, including genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to utilize starch, pentose and cellulose, Zymomonas mobilis to ferment arabinose and xylose, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca to introduce heterogenous ethanol production pathway. The aim of engineering these strains is to obtain an ideal microorganism which can converse the available carbon sources to ethanol rapidly and efficiently with high tolerance to ethanol and to inhibitory components in the cheap materials such as lignocellulose hydrolysate. The importance of fuel ethanol will be a stimulus to develop engineered hardy strains to utilize cheap materials for high ethanol concentration production. Since both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis are generally regarded as safe (GRAS), genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae which can utilize raw starch directly and recombinant Zymomonas mobilis which can ferment glucose, arabinose and xylose in the lignocellulose hydrolysate have potential application to industry in the near future.
TI  - Ethanol production from dilute-Acid softwood hydrolysate by co-culture.
AB  - Dilute-acid softwood hydrolysate, with glucose and xylose as the dominant sugars, was fermented to ethanol by co-cultures. The strains used include Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2.535 (1#), Pachysolen tannophilis ATCC 2.1662 (2#), and recombinant Escherichia coli (3#) constructed in our laboratory carrying both pdc and adhB genes derived from Zymomonas mobilis. Before fermentation, the co-cultures were adapted for five batches. Observation under light microscope showed aggregation of adapted strains, which could possibly improve their ability to degrade inhibitors. In addition, we tried to detoxify the dilute-acid softwood hydrolysate with a combined method before fermentation. Our study showed that fermentation of detoxified hydrolysate by adapted co-culture (1# + 2#) generated an exceptionally high ethanol yield on total sugar of 0.49 g/g, corresponding to 96.1% of the maximal theoretical value after 48 h; fermentation of detoxified hydrolysate by adapted co-culture (1# + 3#) is faster (24 h) and could reach a high ethanol yield (0.45 g/g total sugar). These experiments suggest that both adaptation and detoxification significantly improve hydrolysate fermentation and ethanol production.
TI  - Microdiesel: Escherichia coli engineered for fuel production.
AB  - Biodiesel is an alternative energy source and a substitute for petroleum-based diesel fuel. It is produced from renewable biomass by transesterification of triacylglycerols from plant oils, yielding monoalkyl esters of long-chain fatty acids with short-chain alcohols such as fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs). Despite numerous environmental benefits, a broader use of biodiesel is hampered by the extensive acreage required for sufficient production of oilseed crops. Therefore, processes are urgently needed to enable biodiesel production from more readily available bulk plant materials like sugars or cellulose. Toward this goal, the authors established biosynthesis of biodiesel-adequate FAEEs, referred to as Microdiesel, in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli. This was achieved by heterologous expression in E. coli of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase and the unspecific acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1. By this approach, ethanol formation was combined with subsequent esterification of the ethanol with the acyl moieties of coenzyme A thioesters of fatty acids if the cells were cultivated under aerobic conditions in the presence of glucose and oleic acid. Ethyl oleate was the major constituent of these FAEEs, with minor amounts of ethyl palmitate and ethyl palmitoleate. FAEE concentrations of 1.28 g l(-1) and a FAEE content of the cells of 26 % of the cellular dry mass were achieved by fed-batch fermentation using renewable carbon sources. This novel approach might pave the way for industrial production of biodiesel equivalents from renewable resources by employing engineered micro-organisms, enabling a broader use of biodiesel-like fuels in the future.
TI  - Enhancement of acid tolerance in Zymomonas mobilis by a proton-buffering peptide.
AB  - A portion of the cbpA gene from Escherichia coli K-12 encoding a 24 amino acid proton-buffering peptide (Pbp) was cloned via the shuttle vector pJB99 into E. coli JM105 and subsequently into Zymomonas mobilis CP4. Expression of Pbp was confirmed in both JM105 and CP4 by HPLC. Z. mobilis CP4 carrying pJB99-2 (Pbp) exhibited increased acid tolerance (p < 0.05) in acidified TSB (HCl [pH 3.0] or acetic acid [pH 3.5]), glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.0), and sodium acetate-acetic acid buffer (pH 3.5) in comparison to the parent strain (CP4) and CP4 with pJB99 (control plasmid). Although the expression of Pbp influenced survival at a low pH, the minimum growth pH was unaffected. Growth of Z. mobilis in the presence of ampicillin also significantly increased acid tolerance by an unknown mechanism. Results from this study demonstrate that the production of a peptide with a high proportion of basic amino acids can contribute to protection from low pH and weak organic acids such as acetic acid.
TI  - The 1.9 A resolution structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, a potential drug target.
AB  - 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent rearrangement and reduction of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate to form 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate, as the second step of the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate/methylerythritol 4-phosphate pathway found in many bacteria and plants. The end product, isopentenyl diphosphate, is the precursor of various isoprenoids vital to all living organisms. The pathway is not found in humans; the mevalonate pathway is instead used for the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate. This difference, combined with its essentiality, makes the reductoisomerase an excellent drug target in a number of pathogenic organisms. The structure of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Rv2870c) was solved by molecular replacement and refined to a resolution of 1.9 A. The enzyme exhibited an estimated kcat of 5.3 s-1 and Km and kcat/Km values of 7.2 microM and 7.4x10(5) M-1 s-1 for NADPH and 340 microM and 1.6x10(4) M-1 s-1 for 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate. In the structure, a sulfate is bound at the expected site of the phosphate moiety of the sugar substrate. The M. tuberculosis enzyme displays a similar fold to the previously published structures from Escherichia coli and Zymomonas mobilis. Comparisons offer suggestions for the design of specific drugs. Furthermore, the new structure represents an intermediate conformation between the open apo form and the closed holo form observed previously, giving insights into the conformational changes associated with catalysis.
TI  - Kinetic characterization of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase mutants.
AB  - The methylerythritol phosphate pathway to isoprenoids has been firmly established as an alternate to the mevalonate pathway in many bacteria, plants, algae, and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The second enzyme in this pathway, deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR; E.C. 1.1.1.267), has been the focus of many investigations since it was found to be the target of the antibacterial and antimalarial compound, fosmidomycin. Several x-ray crystal structures of the Escherichia coli and Zymomonas mobilis DXR enzymes have provided important structural information about the residues potentially involved in substrate binding and catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis studies can be used to complement the structural studies, providing kinetic data for specific changes of active site residues. Active site mutants were prepared of the recombinant Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 DXR, targeting residues D152, S153, E154, H155, M206, and E223. Alteration of the three acidic residues had major effects on catalysis, changes to S153 and M206 had variable effects on binding and catalysis, and a H155A mutation had only minimal effects on the kinetic parameters.
TI  - The role of aspartic acid 143 in E. coli tRNA-guanine transglycosylase: insights  from mutagenesis studies and computational modeling.
AB  - tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is a tRNA-modifying enzyme which catalyzes the posttranscriptional exchange of guanine in position 34 of tRNA(Y,H,N,D) with the modified base queuine in eukaryotes or its precursor, preQ(1) base, in eubacteria. Thus, TGT must recognize the guanine in tRNA and the free base queuine or preQ(1) to catalyze this exchange. The crystal structure of Zymomonas mobilis TGT with preQ(1) bound suggests that a key aspartate is critically involved in substrate recognition. To explore this, a series of site-directed mutants of D143 in Escherichia coli TGT were made and characterized to investigate heterocyclic substrate recognition. Our data confirm that D143 has significant impact on K(M) of guanine; however, the trend in the K(M) data (D143A < D143N < D143S < D143T) is unexpected. Computational studies were used to further elucidate the interactions between guanine and the D143 mutants. A homology model of E. coli TGT was created, and the role of D143 was investigated by molecular dynamic simulations of guanine bound to the wild-type and D143-mutant TGTs. To validate the model systems against our kinetic data, free energies of binding were fit using the linear interaction energy (LIE) method. This is a unique application of the LIE method because the same ligand is bound to several mutant proteins rather than one protein binding several ligands. The atomic detail gained from the simulations provided a better understanding of the binding affinities of guanine with the mutant TGTs, revealing that water molecules enter the active site and hydrogen bond to the ligand and compensate for lost protein-ligand interactions. The trend of binding affinity for wild-type > D143A > D143N > D143S > D143T appears to be directly related to the degree of hydrogen bonding available to guanine in the binding site.
TI  - Recombinant production of Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase in the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii.
AB  - The unusual physiological properties of archaea (e.g., growth in extreme salt concentration, temperature and pH) make them ideal platforms for metabolic engineering. Towards the ultimate goal of modifying an archaeon to produce bioethanol or other useful products, the pyruvate decarboxylase gene of Zymomonas mobilis (Zm pdc) was expressed in Haloferax volcanii. This gene has been used successfully to channel pyruvate to ethanol in various Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli. Although the ionic strength of the H. volcanii cytosol differs over 15-fold from that of E. coli, gel filtration and circular dichroism revealed no difference in secondary structure between the ZmPDC protein isolated from either of these hosts. Like the E. coli purified enzyme, ZmPDC from H. volcanii catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. A decrease in the amount of soluble ZmPDC protein was detected as H. volcanii transitioned from log phase to late stationary phase that was inversely proportional to the amount of pdc-specific mRNA. Based on these results, proteins from non-halophilic organisms can be actively synthesized in haloarchaea; however, post-transcriptional mechanisms present in stationary phase appear to limit the amount of recombinant protein expressed.
TI  - Experimental identification and quantification of glucose metabolism in seven bacterial species.
AB  - The structurally conserved and ubiquitous pathways of central carbon metabolism provide building blocks and cofactors for the biosynthesis of cellular macromolecules. The relative uses of pathways and reactions, however, vary widely among species and depend upon conditions, and some are not used at all. Here we identify the network topology of glucose metabolism and its in vivo operation by quantification of intracellular carbon fluxes from 13C tracer experiments. Specifically, we investigated Agrobacterium tumefaciens, two pseudomonads, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Zymomonas mobilis, and Paracoccus versutus, which grow on glucose as the sole carbon source, represent fundamentally different metabolic lifestyles (aerobic, anaerobic, photoheterotrophic, and chemoheterotrophic), and are phylogenetically distinct (firmicutes, gamma-proteobacteria, and alpha-proteobacteria). Compared to those of the model bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, metabolisms of the investigated species differed significantly in several respects: (i) the Entner-Doudoroff pathway was the almost exclusive catabolic route; (ii) the pentose phosphate pathway exhibited exclusively biosynthetic functions, in many cases also requiring flux through the nonoxidative branch; (iii) all aerobes exhibited fully respiratory metabolism without significant overflow metabolism; and (iv) all aerobes used the pyruvate bypass of the malate dehydrogenase reaction to a significant extent. Exclusively, Pseudomonas fluorescens converted most glucose extracellularly to gluconate and 2-ketogluconate. Overall, the results suggest that metabolic data from model species with extensive industrial and laboratory history are not representative of microbial metabolism, at least not quantitatively.
TI  - Novel xylose dehydrogenase in the halophilic archaeon Haloarcula marismortui.
AB  - During growth of the halophilic archaeon Haloarcula marismortui on D-xylose, a specific D-xylose dehydrogenase was induced. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity. It constitutes a homotetramer of about 175 kDa and catalyzed the oxidation of xylose with both NADP+ and NAD+ as cosubstrates with 10-fold higher affinity for NADP+. In addition to D-xylose, D-ribose was oxidized at similar kinetic constants, whereas D-glucose was used with about 70-fold lower catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). With the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the subunit, an open reading frame (ORF)-coding for a 39.9-kDA protein-was identified in the partially sequenced genome of H. marismortui. The function of the ORF as the gene designated xdh and coding for xylose dehydrogenase was proven by its functional overexpression in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was reactivated from inclusion bodies following solubilization in urea and refolding in the presence of salts, reduced and oxidized glutathione, and substrates. Xylose dehydrogenase showed the highest sequence similarity to glucose-fructose oxidoreductase from Zymomonas mobilis and other putative bacterial and archaeal oxidoreductases. Activities of xylose isomerase and xylulose kinase, the initial reactions of xylose catabolism of most bacteria, could not be detected in xylose-grown cells of H. marismortui, and the genes that encode them, xylA and xylB, were not found in the genome of H. marismortui. Thus, we propose that this first characterized archaeal xylose dehydrogenase catalyzes the initial step in xylose degradation by H. marismortui.
TI  - Inhibition of ethanol-producing yeast and bacteria by degradation products produced during pre-treatment of biomass.
AB  - An overview of the different inhibitors formed by pre-treatment of lignocellulosic materials and their inhibition of ethanol production in yeast and bacteria is given. Different high temperature physical pre-treatment methods are available to render the carbohydrates in lignocellulose accessible for ethanol fermentation. The resulting hydrolyzsates contain substances inhibitory to fermentation-depending on both the raw material (biomass) and the pre-treatment applied. An overview of the inhibitory effect on ethanol production by yeast and bacteria is presented. Apart from furans formed by sugar degradation, phenol monomers from lignin degradation are important co-factors in hydrolysate inhibition, and inhibitory effects of these aromatic compounds on different ethanol producing microorganisms is reviewed. The furans and phenols generally inhibited growth and ethanol production rate (Q(EtOH)) but not the ethanol yields (Y(EtOH)) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Within the same phenol functional group (aldehyde, ketone, and acid) the inhibition of volumetric ethanol productivity was found to depend on the amount of methoxyl substituents and hence hydrophobicity (log P). Many pentose-utilizing strains Escherichia coli, Pichia stipititis, and Zymomonas mobilis produce ethanol in concentrated hemicellulose liquors but detoxification by overliming is needed. Thermoanaerobacter mathranii A3M3 can grow on pentoses and produce ethanol in hydrolysate without any need for detoxification.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli: construction of an efficient biocatalyst for D-mannitol formation in a whole-cell biotransformation.
AB  - A whole-cell biotransformation system for the conversion of D-fructose to D-mannitol was developed in Escherichia coli by construction of a recombinant oxidation/reduction cycle. First, the mdh gene encoding for the mannitol dehydrogenase of Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides ATCC 12291 (MDH) was expressed, effecting a strong catalytic activity of a NADH-dependent reduction of D-fructose to D-mannitol in cell extracts of the recombinant E. coli strain but not enabling whole cells of the strain to produce D-mannitol from D-fructose. To provide a source for reduction equivalents needed for D-fructose reduction, the fdh gene from Mycobacterium vaccae N10 (FDH) encoding formate dehydrogenase was functionally co-expressed. FDH generates NADH used for D-fructose reduction by dehydrogenation of formate to carbon dioxide. These recombinant E. coli cells were able to form D-mannitol from D-fructose in a low but significant quantity (15 mM). The introduction of a further gene, encoding for the glucose facilitator protein of Zymomonas mobilis (GLF) enabled the cells to efficiently take up D-fructose into the cells, without simultaneous phosphorylation. Resting cells of this E. coli strain (3 g cell dry weight/l) produced 216 mM D-mannitol in 17 hours. Biotransformations conducted under pH-control by formic acid addition yielded D-mannitol at a concentration of 362 mM within 8 hours. The yield Y(D-mannitol D-fructose) was 84 [mol%]. These results show that the recombinant strain of E. coli can be utilized as an efficient biocatalyst for D-mannitol formation.
TI  - Inhibition of thiamin diphosphate dependent enzymes by 3-deazathiamin diphosphate.
AB  - 3-Deazathiamin diphosphate (deazaTPP) and a second thiamin diphosphate (TPP) analogue having a benzene ring in place of the thiazolium ring have been synthesised. These compounds are both extremely potent inhibitors of pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis; binding is competitive with TPP and is essentially irreversible even though no covalent linkage is formed. DeazaTPP binds approximately seven-fold faster than TPP and at least 25,000-fold more tightly (K(i) less than 14 pM). DeazaTPP is also a potent inhibitor of the E1 subunit of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase from E. coli and binds more than 70-fold faster than TPP. In this case slow reversal of the inhibition could be observed and a K(i) value of about 5 nM was calculated (ca. 500-fold tighter binding than TPP).
TI  - Crystal structure of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase from Zymomonas mobilis at 1.9-A resolution.
AB  - 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) is the second enzyme in the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis. The structure of the apo-form of this enzyme from Zymomonas mobilis has been solved and refined to 1.9-A resolution, and that of a binary complex with the co-substrate NADPH to 2.7-A resolution. The subunit of DXR consists of three domains. Residues 1-150 form the NADPH binding domain, which is a variant of the typical dinucleotide-binding fold. The second domain comprises a four-stranded mixed beta-sheet, with three helices flanking the sheet. Most of the putative active site residues are located on this domain. The C-terminal domain (residues 300-386) folds into a four-helix bundle. In solution and in the crystal, the enzyme forms a homo-dimer. The interface between the two monomers is formed predominantly by extension of the sheet in the second domain. The adenosine phosphate moiety of NADPH binds to the nucleotide-binding fold in the canonical way. The adenine ring interacts with the loop after beta1 and with the loops between alpha2 and beta2 and alpha5 and beta5. The nicotinamide ring is disordered in crystals of this binary complex. Comparisons to Escherichia coli DXR show that the two enzymes are very similar in structure, and that the active site architecture is highly conserved. However, there are differences in the recognition of the adenine ring of NADPH in the two enzymes.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli: construction of an efficient biocatalyst for D-mannitol formation in a whole-cell biotransformation.
AB  - A whole-cell biotransformation system for the conversion of d-fructose to d-mannitol was developed in Escherichia coli by constructing a recombinant oxidation/reduction cycle. First, the mdh gene, encoding mannitol dehydrogenase of Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides ATCC 12291 (MDH), was expressed, effecting strong catalytic activity of an NADH-dependent reduction of D-fructose to D-mannitol in cell extracts of the recombinant E. coli strain. By contrast whole cells of the strain were unable to produce D-mannitol from D-fructose. To provide a source of reduction equivalents needed for d-fructose reduction, the fdh gene from Mycobacterium vaccae N10 (FDH), encoding formate dehydrogenase, was functionally co-expressed. FDH generates the NADH used for d-fructose reduction by dehydrogenation of formate to carbon dioxide. These recombinant E. coli cells were able to form D-mannitol from D-fructose in a low but significant quantity (15 mM). The introduction of a further gene, encoding the glucose facilitator protein of Zymomonas mobilis (GLF), allowed the cells to efficiently take up D-fructose, without simultaneous phosphorylation. Resting cells of this E. coli strain (3 g cell dry weight/l) produced 216 mM D-mannitol in 17 h. Due to equimolar formation of sodium hydroxide during NAD(+)-dependent oxidation of sodium formate to carbon dioxide, the pH value of the buffered biotransformation system increased by one pH unit within 2 h. Biotransformations conducted under pH control by formic-acid addition yielded d-mannitol at a concentration of 362 mM within 8 h. The yield Y(D-mannitol/D-fructose) was 84 mol%. These results show that the recombinant strain of E. coli can be utilized as an efficient biocatalyst for d-mannitol formation.
TI  - Serine substitution for cysteine residues in levansucrase selectively abolishes levan forming activity.
AB  - Levansucrase is responsible for levan formation during sucrose fermentation of Zymomonas mobilis, and this decreases the efficiency of ethanol production. As thiol modifying agents decrease levan formation, a role for cysteine residues in levansucrase activity has been examined using derivatives of Z. mobilis levansucrase that carry serine substitutions of cysteine at positions 121, 151 or 244. These substitutions abolished the levan forming activity of levansucrase whilst only halving its activity in sucrose hydrolysis. Thus, polymerase and hydrolase activities of Z. mobilis levansucrase are separate and have different requirements for the enzyme's cysteine residues.
TI  - Characterization of native and histidine-tagged deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803.
AB  - The dxr gene encoding the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was expressed in Escherichia coli to produce both the native and N-terminal histidine-tagged forms of DXR. The enzymes were purified from the cell extracts using either anion exchange chromatography or metal affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The purified recombinant native and histidine-tagged enzymes each displayed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels, corresponding to the calculated subunit molecular weights of 42,500 and 46,700, respectively. By native PAGE, both enzymes were dimers under reducing conditions. The kinetic properties for the enzymes were characterized and only minor variations were observed, demonstrating that the N-terminal histidine tag does not greatly affect the activity of the enzyme. Both enzymes had similar properties to previously characterized reductoisomerases from other sources. The K(m)'s for the metal ions Mn(2+), Mg(2+), and Co(2+) were determined for native DXR for the first time, with the K(m) for Mg(2+) being approximately 200-fold higher than the K(m)'s for Mn(2+) and Co(2+).
TI  - Altered glucose transport and shikimate pathway product yields in E. coli.
AB  - Different glucose transport systems are examined for their impact on phosphoenolpyruvate availability as reflected by the yields of 3-dehydroshikimic acid and byproducts 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid, 3-dehydroquinic acid, and gallic acid synthesized by Escherichia coli from glucose. 3-Dehydroshikimic acid is an advanced shikimate pathway intermediate in the syntheses of a spectrum of commodity, pseudocommodity, and fine chemicals. All constructs carried plasmid aroF(FBR) and tktA inserts encoding, respectively, a feedback-insensitive isozyme of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase and transketolase. Reliance on the native E. coli phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system for glucose transport led in 48 h to the synthesis of 3-dehydroshikimic acid (49 g/L) and shikimate pathway byproducts in a total yield of 33% (mol/mol). Use of heterologously expressed Zymomonas mobilis glf-encoded glucose facilitator and glk-encoded glucokinase resulted in the synthesis in 48 h of 3-dehydroshikimic acid (60 g/L) and shikimate pathway byproducts in a total yield of 41% (mol/mol). Recruitment of native E. coli galP-encoded galactose permease for glucose transport required 60 h to synthesize 3-dehydroshikimic acid (60 g/L) and shikimate pathway byproducts in a total yield of 43% (mol/mol). Direct comparison of the impact of altered glucose transport on the yields of shikimate pathway products synthesized by E. coli has been previously hampered by different experimental designs and culturing conditions. In this study, the same product and byproduct mixture synthesized by E. coli constructs derived from the same progenitor strain is used to compare strategies for increasing phosphoenolpyruvate availability. Constructs are cultured under the same set of fermentor-controlled conditions.
TI  - Flexible adaptations in the structure of the tRNA-modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase and their implications for substrate selectivity, reaction mechanism and structure-based drug design.
AB  - The enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT, EC 2.4.2.29) catalyses a base-exchange reaction that leads to anticodon modifications of certain tRNAs. The TGT enzymes of the eubacteria Zymomonas mobilis (Z. mobilis TGT) and Escherichia coli (E. coli TGT) show a different behaviour in the presence of competitive inhibitors. The active sites of both enzymes are identical apart from a single conservative amino acid exchange, namely Tyr106 of Z. mobilis TGT is replaced by a Phe in E. coli TGT. Although Tyr106 is, in contrast to Phe106, hydrogen bonded in the ligand-free structure, we can show by a mutational study of TGT(Y106F) that this is not the reason for the different responses upon competition. The TGT enzymes of various species differ in their substrate selectivity. Depending on the applied pH conditions and/or induced by ligand binding, a peptide-bond flip modulates the recognition properties of the substrate binding site, which changes between donor and acceptor functionality. Furthermore interstitial water molecules play an important role in these adaptations of the pocket. The flip of the peptide bond is further stabilised by a glutamate residue that operates as general acid/base. An active-site aspartate residue, presumed to operate as a nucleophile through covalent bonding during the base-exchange reaction, shows different conformations depending on the nature of the bound ligand. The induced-fit adaptations observed in the various TGT complex structures by multiple crystal-structure analyses are in agreement with the functional properties of the enzyme. In consequence, full understanding of this plasticity can be exploited for drug design.
TI  - Bacteria engineered for fuel ethanol production: current status.
AB  - The lack of industrially suitable microorganisms for converting biomass into fuel ethanol has traditionally been cited as a major technical roadblock to developing a bioethanol industry. In the last two decades, numerous microorganisms have been engineered to selectively produce ethanol. Lignocellulosic biomass contains complex carbohydrates that necessitate utilizing microorganisms capable of fermenting sugars not fermentable by brewers' yeast. The most significant of these is xylose. The greatest successes have been in the engineering of Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Zymomonas mobilis. E. coli and K. oxytoca are naturally able to use a wide spectrum of sugars, and work has concentrated on engineering these strains to selectively produce ethanol. Z. mobilis produces ethanol at high yields, but ferments only glucose and fructose. Work on this organism has concentrated on introducing pathways for the fermentation of arabinose and xylose. The history of constructing these strains and current progress in refining them are detailed in this review.
TI  - Chemical trapping and crystal structure of a catalytic tRNA guanine transglycosylase covalent intermediate.
AB  - Prokaryotic tRNA guanine transglycosylase (TGT) catalyzes replacement of guanine  (G) by 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (PreQ1) at the wobble position of four specific tRNAs. Addition of 9-deazaguanine (9dzG) to a reaction mixture of Zymomonas mobilis TGT and an RNA substrate allowed us to trap, purify and crystallize a chemically competent covalent intermediate of the TGT-catalyzed reaction. The crystal structure of the TGT-RNA-9dzG ternary complex at a resolution of 2.9 A reveals, unexpectedly, that RNA is tethered to TGT through the side chain of Asp280. Thus, Asp280, instead of the previously proposed Asp102, acts as the nucleophile for the reaction. The RNA substrate adopts an unusual conformation, with four out of seven nucleotides in the loop region flipped out. Interactions between TGT and RNA revealed by the structure provide the molecular basis of the RNA substrate requirements by TGT. Furthermore, reaction of PreQ1 with the crystallized covalent intermediate provides insight into the necessary structural changes required for the TGT-catalyzed reaction to occur.
TI  - An essential role for aspartate 264 in catalysis by tRNA-guanine transglycosylase from Escherichia coli.
AB  - tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) catalyzes a post-transcriptional base-exchange reaction involved in the incorporation of the modified base queuine (Q) into the wobble position of certain tRNAs. Catalysis by TGT occurs through a double-displacement mechanism that involves the formation of a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate (Kittendorf, J. D., Barcomb, L. M., Nonekowski, S. T., and Garcia, G. A. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 14123-14133). The TGT chemical mechanism requires the protonation of the displaced guanine and the deprotonation of the incoming heterocyclic base. Based on its position in the active site, it is likely that aspartate 264 is involved in these proton transfer events. To investigate this possibility, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to convert aspartate 264 to alanine, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, lysine, and histidine. Biochemical characterization of these TGT mutants revealed that only the conservative glutamate mutant retained catalytic activity, with Km values for both tRNA and guanine 3-fold greater than those for wild-type, whereas the kcat was depressed by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, of these six TGT mutants, only the TGT(D264E) was capable of forming a TGT.RNA covalent intermediate; however, unlike wild-type TGT, only hydroxylamine is capable of cleaving the TGT(D264E).RNA covalent complex. In an effort to better understand the unique biochemical properties of the D264E TGT mutant, we solved the crystal structure of the Zymomonas mobilis TGT with the analogous mutation (D280E). The results of these studies support two roles for aspartate 264 in catalysis by TGT, protonation of the leaving guanine and deprotonation of the incoming preQ1.
TI  - Expression of galP and glk in a Escherichia coli PTS mutant restores glucose transport and increases glycolytic flux to fermentation products.
AB  - In Escherichia coli, the uptake and phosphorylation of glucose is carried out mainly by the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Despite the efficiency of glucose transport by PTS, the required consumption of 1 mol of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) for each mol of internalized glucose represents a drawback for some biotechnological applications where PEP is a precursor of the desired product. For this reason, there is considerable interest in the generation of strains that can transport glucose efficiently by a non-PTS mechanism. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of different gene expression levels, of galactose permease (GalP) and glucokinase (Glk), on glucose internalization and phosphorylation in a E. coli PTS(-) strain. The W3110 PTS(-), designated VH32, showed limited growth on glucose with a specific growth rate (mu) of 0.03 h(-1). A low copy plasmid family was constructed containing E. coli galP and glk genes, individually or combined, under the control of a trc-derived promoter set. This plasmid family was used to transform the VH32 strain, each plasmid having different levels of expression of galP and glk. Experiments in minimal medium with glucose showed that expression of only galP under the control of a wild-type trc promoter resulted in a mu of 0.55 h(-1), corresponding to 89% of the mu measured for W3110 (0.62 h(-1)). In contrast, no increase in specific growth rate (mu) was observed in VH32 with a plasmid expressing only glk from the same promoter. Strains transformed with part of the plasmid family, containing both galP and glk genes, showed a mu value similar to that of W3110. Fermentor experiments with the VH32 strain harboring plasmids pv1Glk1GalP, pv4Glk5GalP, and pv5Glk5GalP showed that specific acetate productivity was twofold higher than in W3110. Introduction of plasmid pLOI1594, coding for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis, to strain VH32 carrying one of the plasmids with galP and glk caused a twofold increase in ethanol productivity over strain W3110, also containing pLOI1594.
TI  - Detection of aromatic alpha-hydroxyketones with tetrazolium salts.

TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate availability and the biosynthesis of shikimic acid.
AB  - The impact of increased availability of phosphoenolpyruvate during shikimic acid  biosynthesis has been examined in Escherichia coli K-12 constructs carrying plasmid-localized aroF(FBR) and tktA inserts encoding, respectively, feedback-insensitive 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase and transketolase. Strategies for increasing the availability of phosphoenolpyruvate were based on amplified expression of E. coli ppsA-encoded phosphoenolpyruvate synthase or heterologous expression of the Zymomonas mobilis glf-encoded glucose facilitator. The highest titers and yields of shikimic acid biosynthesized from glucose in 1 L fermentor runs were achieved using E. coli SP1.lpts/pSC6.090B, which expressed both Z. mobilis glf-encoded glucose facilitator protein and Z. mobilis glk-encoded glucose kinase in a host deficient in the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system. At 10 L scale with yeast extract supplementation, E. coli SP1.lpts/pSC6.090B synthesized 87 g/L of shikimic acid in 36% (mol/mol) yield with a maximum productivity of 5.2 g/L/h for shikimic acid synthesized during the exponential phase of growth.
TI  - Studies on structure-function relationships of indolepyruvate decarboxylase from  Enterobacter cloacae, a key enzyme of the indole acetic acid pathway.
AB  - Enterobacter cloacae, isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumbers, produces large  amounts of indole-3-acetic acid. Indolepyruvate decarboxylase, the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of indole-3-acetic acid, catalyses the formation of indole-3-acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide from indole-3-pyruvic acid. The enzyme requires the cofactors thiamine diphosphate and magnesium ions for catalytic activity. Recombinant indolepyruvate decarboxylase was purified from the host Escherichia coli strain JM109. Specificity of the enzyme for the substrates indole-3-pyruvic acid, pyruvic acid, benzoylformic acid, and seven benzoylformic acid analogues was investigated using a continuous optical assay. Stopped-flow kinetic data showed no indication for substrate activation in the decarboxylation reaction of indole-3-pyruvic acid, pyruvic acid or benzoylformic acid. Size exclusion chromatography and small angle X-ray solution scattering experiments suggested the tetramer as the catalytically active state and a pH-dependent subunit association equilibrium. Analysis of the kinetic constants of the benzoylformic acid analogues according to Hansch et al. [Hansch, C., Leo, A., Unger, S.H., Kim, K.H., Nikaitani, D & Lien, E.J. (1973) J. Med. Chem.16, 1207-1216] and comparison with indole-3-pyruvic acid conversion by pyruvate decarboxylases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis provided some insight into the catalytic mechanism of indolepyruvate decarboxylase.
TI  - Crystal structure of thiamindiphosphate-dependent indolepyruvate decarboxylase from Enterobacter cloacae, an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid.
AB  - The thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase catalyses the formation of indoleacetaldehyde from indolepyruvate, one step in the indolepyruvate pathway of biosynthesis of the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid. The crystal structure of this enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae has been determined at 2.65 A resolution and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.5% (Rfree 23.6%). The subunit of indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains three domains of open alpha/beta topology, which are similar in structure to that of pyruvate decarboxylase. The tetramer has pseudo 222 symmetry and can be described as a dimer of dimers. It resembles the tetramer of pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis, but with a relative difference of 20 degrees in the angle between the two dimers. Active site residues are highly conserved in indolepyruvate/pyruvate decarboxylase, suggesting that the interactions with the cofactor thiamin diphosphate and the catalytic mechanisms are very similar. The substrate binding site in indolepyruvate decarboxylase contains a large hydrophobic pocket which can accommodate the bulky indole moiety of the substrate. In pyruvate decarboxylases this pocket is smaller in size and allows discrimination of larger vs. smaller substrates. In most pyruvate decarboxylases, restriction of cavity size is due to replacement of residues at three positions by large, hydrophobic amino acids such as tyrosine or tryptophan.
TI  - Engineering lactic acid bacteria with pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase genes for ethanol production from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria are candidates for engineered production of ethanol from biomass because they are food-grade microorganisms that can, in many cases, metabolize a variety of sugars and grow under harsh conditions. In an effort to divert fermentation from production of lactic acid to ethanol, plasmids were constructed to express pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), encoded by the pdc and adhB genes of Zymomonas mobilis, in lactic acid bacteria. Several strains were transformed with the plasmids, and transcription of pdc and adhB was confirmed by northern hybridization analysis of transformants. PDC and ADH enzyme activities were at least 5- to 10-fold lower in these bacteria compared to Escherichia coli transformed with the same plasmid. Glucose fermentations were carried out, and some, but not all, of the transformed strains produced more ethanol than the untransformed parent strains. However, lactic acid was the primary fermentation product formed by all of the transformants, indicating that ADH and PDC activities were insufficient to divert significant carbon flow towards ethanol.
TI  - Interplay of SOS induction, recombinant gene expression, and multimerization of plasmid vectors in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Using pBR322- and pUC-derived plasmid vectors, a homologous (Escherichia coli native esterase) and three heterologous proteins (human interleukin-2, human interleukin-6, and Zymomonas levansucrase) were synthesized in E. coli IC2015(recA::lacZ) and GY4786 (sfiA::lacZ) strains. Via time-course measurement of beta-galactosidase activity in each recombinant culture, the SOS induction was estimated in detail and the results were systematically compared. In recombinant E. coli, the SOS response did not happen either with the recombinant insert-negative plasmid backbone alone or the expression vectors containing the homologous gene. Irrespective of gene expression level and toxic activity of synthesized foreign proteins, the SOS response was induced only when the heterologous genes were expressed using a particular plasmid vector, indicating strong dependence on the recombinant gene clone and the selection of a plasmid vector system. It is suggested that in recombinant E. coli the SOS response (i.e., activation of recA expression and initial sfiA expression) may be related neither to metabolic burden nor toxic cellular event(s) by synthesized heterologous protein, but may be provoked by foreign gene-specific interaction between a foreign gene and a plasmid vector. Unlike in E. coli XL1-blue(recA(-)) strains used, all expression vectors encoding each of the three heterologous proteins were multimerized in E. coli IC2015 strains in the course of cultivation, whereas the expression vectors containing the homologous gene never formed the plasmid multimers. The extent of multimerization was also dependent on a foreign gene insert in the expression vector. As a dominant effect of the SOS induction, recombinant plasmid vectors used for heterologous protein expression appear to significantly form various multimers in the recA(+) E. coli host.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the Zymobacter palmae pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc) and comparison to bacterial homologues.
AB  - Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) is the key enzyme in all homo-ethanol fermentations. Although widely distributed among plants, yeasts, and fungi, PDC is absent in animals and rare in bacteria (established for only three organisms). Genes encoding the three known bacterial pdc genes have been previously described and expressed as active recombinant proteins. The pdc gene from Zymomonas mobilis has been used to engineer ethanol-producing biocatalysts for use in industry. In this paper, we describe a new bacterial pdc gene from Zymobacter palmae. The pattern of codon usage for this gene appears quite similar to that for Escherichia coli genes. In E. coli recombinants, the Z. palmae PDC represented approximately 1/3 of the soluble protein. Biochemical and kinetic properties of the Z. palmae enzyme were compared to purified PDCs from three other bacteria. Of the four bacterial PDCs, the Z. palmae enzyme exhibited the highest specific activity (130 U mg of protein(-1)) and the lowest Km for pyruvate (0.24 mM). Differences in biochemical properties, thermal stability, and codon usage may offer unique advantages for the development of new biocatalysts for fuel ethanol production.
TI  - Performance testing of Zymomonas mobilis metabolically engineered for cofermentation of glucose, xylose, and arabinose.
AB  - IOGEN Corporation of Ottawa, Canada, has recently built a 40t/d biomass-to-ethanol demonstration plant adjacent to its enzyme production facility. It has partnered with the University of Toronto to test the C6/C5 cofermenta-tion performance characteristics of the National Renewable Energy Labora-tory's metabolically engineered Zymomonas mobilis using various biomass hydrolysates. IOGEN's feedstocks are primarily agricultural wastes such as corn stover and wheat straw. Integrated recombinant Z. mobilis strain AX101 grows on D-xylose and/or L-arabinose as the sole carbon/energy sources and ferments these pentose sugars to ethanol in high yield. Strain AX101 lacks the tetracycline resistance gene that was a common feature of other recombinant Zm constructs. Genomic integration provides reliable cofermentation performance in the absence of antibiotics, another characteristic making strain AX101 attractive for industrial cellulosic ethanol production. In this work, IOGEN's biomass hydrolysate was simulated by a pure sugar medium containing 6% (w/v) glucose, 3% xylose, and 0.35% arabinose. At a level of 3 g/L (dry solids), corn steep liquor with inorganic nitrogen (0.8 g/L of ammonium chloride or 1.2 g/L of diammonium phosphate) was a cost-effective nutritional supplement. In the absence of acetic acid, the maximum volumetric ethanol productivity of a continuous fermentation at pH 5.0 was 3.54 g/L x h. During prolonged continuous fermentation, the efficiency of sugar-to-ethanol conversion (based on total sugar load) was maintained at >85%. At a level of 0.25% (w/v) acetic acid, the productivity decreased to 1.17 g/L x h at pH 5.5. Unlike integrated, xylose-utilizing rec Zm strain C25, strain AX101 produces less lactic acid as byproduct, owing to the fact that the Escherichia coli arabinose genes are inserted into a region of the host chromosome tentatively assigned to the gene for D-lactic acid dehydrogenase. In pH-controlled batch fermentations with sugar mixtures, the order of sugar exhaustion from the medium was glucose followed by xylose and arabinose. Both the total sugar load and the sugar ratio were shown to be important determinants for efficient cofermentation. Ethanol at a level of 3% (w/v) was implicated as both inhibitory to pentose fermentation and as a potentiator of acetic acid inhibition of pentose fermentation at pH 5.5. The effect of ethanol may have been underestimated in other assessments of acetic acid sensitivity. This work underscores the importance of employing similar assay conditions in making comparative assessments of biocatalyst fermentation performance.
TI  - Flux through citrate synthase limits the growth of ethanologenic Escherichia coli KO11 during xylose fermentation.
AB  - Previous studies have shown that high levels of complex nutrients (Luria broth or 5% corn steep liquor) were necessary for rapid ethanol production by the ethanologenic strain Escherichia coli KO11. Although this strain is prototrophic, cell density and ethanol production remained low in mineral salts media (10% xylose) unless complex nutrients were added. The basis for this nutrient requirement was identified as a regulatory problem created by metabolic engineering of an ethanol pathway. Cells must partition pyruvate between competing needs for biosynthesis and regeneration of NAD(+). Expression of low-K(m) Zymomonas mobilis pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase) in KO11 reduced the flow of pyruvate carbon into native fermentation pathways as desired, but it also restricted the flow of carbon skeletons into the 2-ketoglutarate arm of the tricarboxylic acid pathway (biosynthesis). In mineral salts medium containing 1% corn steep liquor and 10% xylose, the detrimental effect of metabolic engineering was substantially reduced by addition of pyruvate. A similar benefit was also observed when acetaldehyde, 2-ketoglutarate, or glutamate was added. In E. coli, citrate synthase links the cellular abundance of NADH to the supply of 2-ketoglutarate for glutamate biosynthesis. This enzyme is allosterically regulated and inhibited by high NADH concentrations. In addition, citrate synthase catalyzes the first committed step in 2-ketoglutarate synthesis. Oxidation of NADH by added acetaldehyde (or pyruvate) would be expected to increase the activity of E. coli citrate synthase and direct more carbon into 2-ketoglutarate, and this may explain the stimulation of growth. This hypothesis was tested, in part, by cloning the Bacillus subtilis citZ gene encoding an NADH-insensitive citrate synthase. Expression of recombinant citZ in KO11 was accompanied by increases in cell growth and ethanol production, which substantially reduced the need for complex nutrients.
TI  - Pyruvate decarboxylase: a key enzyme for the oxidative metabolism of lactic acid  by Acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  - Acetobacter pasteurianus, an obligately oxidative bacterium, is the first organism shown to utilize pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) as a central enzyme for oxidative metabolism. In plants, yeast, and other bacteria, PDC functions solely as part of the fermentative ethanol pathway. During the growth of A. pasteurianus on lactic acid, the central intermediate pyruvate is cleaved to acetaldehyde and CO(2) by PDC. Acetaldehyde is subsequently oxidized to its final product, acetic acid. The presence of the PDC enzyme in A. pasteurianus was confirmed by zymograms stained for acetaldehyde production, enzyme assays using alcohol dehydrogenase as the coupling enzyme, and by cloning and characterization of the pdc operon. A. pasteurianus pdc was also expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli. The level of PDC activity was regulated in response to growth substrate, highest with lactic acid and absent with mannitol. The translated PDC sequence (548 amino acids) was most similar to that of Zymomonas mobilis, an obligately fermentative bacterium. A second operon ( aldA) was also found which is transcribed divergently from pdc. This operon encodes a putative aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD2; 357 amino acids) related to class III alcohol dehydrogenases and most similar to glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenases from alpha-Proteobacteria and Anabeana azollae.
TI  - tRNA-guanine transglycosylase from Escherichia coli: molecular mechanism and role of aspartate 89.
AB  - The enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT, EC 2.4.2.29) catalyzes a posttranscriptional transglycosylation reaction involved in the incorporation of the modified base queuine [Q, 7-(4,5-cis-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-ylaminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine] into tRNA. Previously, the crystal structure of the TGT from Zymomonas mobilis was solved in complex with preQ(1) (the substrate for the eubacterial TGT) [Romier et al. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 2850-2857]. An aspartate residue at position 102 (position 89 in the Escherichia coli TGT) was proposed to play a nucleophilic role in an associative catalytic mechanism. Although this is an attractive and precedented mechanism, a dissociative mechanism is equally plausible. In a dissociative mechanism, aspartate 89 would provide electrostatic stabilization of an oxocarbenium ion intermediate that is formed by dissociation of guanine. To clarify the nature of the catalytic mechanism of TGT, we have generated and characterized four mutations of aspartate 89 in the E. coli TGT (alanine, asparagine, cysteine, and glutamate). All four mutant TGTs were able to noncovalently bind tRNA, but only the glutamate mutant was able to form a stable complex with the RNA substrate under denaturing conditions that was comparable to wild type. Furthermore, the glutamate mutant was the only mutant TGT that demonstrated significant activity. Kinetic parameters were determined for this enzyme and shown to be comparable to wild type, revealing that the enzyme is considerably tolerant of the positioning of the carboxylate. Under conditions of high enzyme concentrations and long time courses, the alanine, asparagine, and cysteine mutants showed very low levels (ca. 10(3)-fold lower than wild type) of activity that were linear with respect to enzyme concentration and dependent upon pH in a fashion similar to that of the wild type. However, the observed initial velocities were too low to accurately determine k(cat) and K(m) values. We hypothesize that the activity observed for these mutants is most likely derived from host strain TGT (wt) contamination. These results are most consistent with aspartate 89 acting as a nucleophile in an associative catalytic mechanism.
TI  - The Chryseobacterium meningosepticum PafA enzyme: prototype of a new enzyme family of prokaryotic phosphate-irrepressible alkaline phosphatases?
AB  - Chryseobacterium meningosepticum is an aerobic Gram-negative rod widely distributed in natural environments. Unlike many bacteria, it produces a phosphate-irrepressible periplasmic alkaline phosphatase (AP). This work describes cloning of the gene encoding that enzyme from C. meningosepticum CCUG 4310 (NCTC 10585), and preliminary characterization of its product. The gene, named pafA, encodes a protein (PafA) of 546 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of the mature peptide of 58682 Da. PafA exhibits high sequence identity with the PhoV AP of Synechococcus PCC 7942 (49.9% identity) and with the Cda Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase of Myroides odoratus (51.9% identity), while being more distantly related to the PhoD AP of Zymomonas mobilis (22.1% identity) and to the PhoA AP of Escherichia coli (14.0% identity). PafA was partially purified; it exhibits optimal activity at pH 8.5 and is active towards a broad spectrum of substrates including both phosphomonoesters and ATP, with preferential activity for the latter compound. The present findings allow definition of a new family of APs including 60 kDa, periplasmic enzymes whose expression is not influenced by freely available P(i) in the medium. Moreover, PafA can be considered an evolutionary intermediate between Ca(2+)-ATPase of M. odoratus and the APs PhoV of Synechococcus PCC 7942 and PhoD of Z. mobilis.
TI  - Production of the Gram-positive Sarcina ventriculi pyruvate decarboxylase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Sarcina ventriculi grows in a remarkable range of mesophilic environments from pH 2 to pH 10. During growth in acidic environments, where acetate is toxic, expression of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) serves to direct the flow of pyruvate into ethanol during fermentation. PDC is rare in bacteria and absent in animals, although it is widely distributed in the plant kingdom. The pdc gene from S. ventriculi is the first to be cloned and characterized from a Gram-positive bacterium. In Escherichia coli, the recombinant pdc gene from S. ventriculi was poorly expressed due to differences in codon usage that are typical of low-G+C organisms. Expression was improved by the addition of supplemental codon genes and this facilitated the 136-fold purification of the recombinant enzyme as a homo-tetramer of 58 kDa subunits. Unlike Zymomonas mobilis PDC, which exhibits Michaelis-Menten kinetics, S. ventriculi PDC is activated by pyruvate and exhibits sigmoidal kinetics similar to fungal and higher plant PDCs. Amino acid residues involved in the allosteric site for pyruvate in fungal PDCs were conserved in S. ventriculi PDC, consistent with a conservation of mechanism. Cluster analysis of deduced amino acid sequences confirmed that S. ventriculi PDC is quite distant from Z. mobilis PDC and plant PDCs. S. ventriculi PDC appears to have diverged very early from a common ancestor which included most fungal PDCs and eubacterial indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylases. These results suggest that the S. ventriculi pdc gene is quite ancient in origin, in contrast to the Z. mobilis pdc, which may have originated by horizontal transfer from higher plants.
TI  - Crystal structure of histidinol phosphate aminotransferase (HisC) from Escherichia coli, and its covalent complex with pyridoxal-5'-phosphate and l-histidinol phosphate.
AB  - The biosynthesis of histidine is a central metabolic process in organisms ranging from bacteria to yeast and plants. The seventh step in the synthesis of histidine within eubacteria is carried out by a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent l-histidinol phosphate aminotransferase (HisC, EC 2.6.1.9). Here, we report the crystal structure of l-histidinol phosphate aminotransferase from Escherichia coli, as a complex with pyridoxamine-5'-phosphate (PMP) at 1.5 A resolution, as the internal aldimine with PLP, and in a covalent, tetrahedral complex consisting of PLP and l-histidinol phosphate attached to Lys214, both at 2.2 A resolution. This covalent complex resembles, in structural terms, the gem-diamine intermediate that is formed transiently during conversion of the internal to external aldimine.HisC is a dimeric enzyme with a mass of approximately 80 kDa. Like most PLP-dependent enzymes, each HisC monomer consists of two domains, a larger PLP-binding domain having an alpha/beta/alpha topology, and a smaller domain. An N-terminal arm contributes to the dimerization of the two monomers. The PLP-binding domain of HisC shows weak sequence similarity, but significant structural similarity with the PLP-binding domains of a number of PLP-dependent enzymes. Residues that interact with the PLP cofactor, including Tyr55, Asn157, Asp184, Tyr187, Ser213, Lys214 and Arg222, are conserved in the family of aspartate, tyrosine and histidinol phosphate aminotransferases. The imidazole ring of l-histidinol phosphate is bound, in part, through a hydrogen bond with Tyr110, a residue that is substituted by Phe in the broad substrate specific HisC enzymes from Zymomonas mobilis and Bacillus subtilis. Comparison of the structures of the HisC internal aldimine, the PMP complex and the HisC l-histidinol phosphate complex reveal minimal changes in protein or ligand structure. Proton transfer, required for conversion of the gem-diamine to the external aldimine, does not appear to be limited by the distance between substrate and lysine amino groups. We propose that the tetrahedral complex has resulted from non-productive binding of l-histidinol phosphate soaked into the HisC crystals, resulting in its inability to be converted to the external aldimine at the HisC active site.
TI  - Fuel ethanol production from lignocellulose: a challenge for metabolic engineering and process integration.
AB  - With industrial development growing rapidly, there is a need for environmentally  sustainable energy sources. Bioethanol (ethanol from biomass) is an attractive, sustainable energy source to fuel transportation. Based on the premise that fuel bioethanol can contribute to a cleaner environment and with the implementation of environmental protection laws in many countries, demand for this fuel is increasing. Efficient ethanol production processes and cheap substrates are needed. Current ethanol production processes using crops such as sugar cane and corn are well-established; however, utilization of a cheaper substrate such as lignocellulose could make bioethanol more competitive with fossil fuel. The processing and utilization of this substrate is complex, differing in many aspects from crop-based ethanol production. One important requirement is an efficient microorganism able to ferment a variety of sugars (pentoses, and hexoses) as well as to tolerate stress conditions. Through metabolic engineering, bacterial and yeast strains have been constructed which feature traits that are advantageous for ethanol production using lignocellulose sugars. After several rounds of modification/evaluation/modification, three main microbial platforms, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, and Escherichia coli, have emerged and they have performed well in pilot studies. While there are ongoing efforts to further enhance their properties, improvement of the fermentation process is just one of several factors-that needs to be fully optimized and integrated to generate a competitive lignocellulose ethanol plant.
TI  - ISZm1068: an IS5-like insertion element from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - A new insertion sequence, designated ISZm1068, was isolated from Zymomonas mobilis strain CP4. This element consists of 1,068 bp and contains one major ORF which shows similarities both at the nucleotide and at the amino acid sequence level with the corresponding ORFs encoding the transposases of many IS5 family elements, in particular the IS1031 group. Moreover, the Z. mobilis ORF shares the conserved N2, N3 and C1 signature motifs of the IS4 and IS5 families. Six out of seven Z. mobilis wild-type strains were shown by hybridisation to contain a single copy of the ISZm1068 element. Nucleotide sequences of the insertion elements from these strains exhibited extremely high levels of identity, varying from 94.25 to 99.25%. ISZm1068 was shown to be active in Escherichia coli cells and led to plasmid replicon fusions within the host cell. Sequence analysis of rare cointegration and resolution derivatives suggests that ISZm1068 has putative imperfect inverted repeats at its extremities of 18 bp (IR-right) and 14 bp (IR-left), and that a 3-bp (5'-TCA-3') target sequence is duplicated upon insertion.
TI  - Engineering a homo-ethanol pathway in Escherichia coli: increased glycolytic flux and levels of expression of glycolytic genes during xylose fermentation.
AB  - Replacement of the native fermentation pathway in Escherichia coli B with a homo-ethanol pathway from Zymomonas mobilis (pdc and adhB genes) resulted in a 30 to 50% increase in growth rate and glycolytic flux during the anaerobic fermentation of xylose. Gene array analysis was used as a tool to investigate differences in expression levels for the 30 genes involved in xylose catabolism in the parent (strain B) and the engineered strain (KO11). Of the 4,290 total open reading frames, only 8% were expressed at a significantly higher level in KO11 (P < 0.05). In contrast, over half of the 30 genes involved in the catabolism of xylose to pyruvate were expressed at 1.5-fold- to 8-fold-higher levels in KO11. For 14 of the 30 genes, higher expression was statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (xylAB, xylE, xylFG, xylR, rpiA, rpiB, pfkA, fbaA, tpiA, gapA, pgk, and pykA) during active fermentation (6, 12, and 24 h). Values at single time points for only four of these genes (eno, fbaA, fbaB, and talA) were higher in strain B than in KO11. The relationship between changes in mRNA (cDNA) levels and changes in specific activities was verified for two genes (xylA and xylB) with good agreement. In KO11, expression levels and activities were threefold higher than in strain B for xylose isomerase (xylA) and twofold higher for xylulokinase (xylB). Increased expression of genes involved in xylose catabolism is proposed as the basis for the increase in growth rate and glycolytic flux in ethanologenic KO11.
TI  - Specificity of signal peptide recognition in tat-dependent bacterial protein translocation.
AB  - The bacterial twin arginine translocation (Tat) pathway translocates across the cytoplasmic membrane folded proteins which, in most cases, contain a tightly bound cofactor. Specific amino-terminal signal peptides that exhibit a conserved amino acid consensus motif, S/T-R-R-X-F-L-K, direct these proteins to the Tat translocon. The glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (GFOR) of Zymomonas mobilis is a periplasmic enzyme with tightly bound NADP as a cofactor. It is synthesized as a cytoplasmic precursor with an amino-terminal signal peptide that shows all of the characteristics of a typical twin arginine signal peptide. However, GFOR is not exported to the periplasm when expressed in the heterologous host Escherichia coli, and enzymatically active pre-GFOR is found in the cytoplasm. A precise replacement of the pre-GFOR signal peptide by an authentic E. coli Tat signal peptide, which is derived from pre-trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase (TorA), allowed export of GFOR, together with its bound cofactor, to the E. coli periplasm. This export was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, but not by sodium azide, and was blocked in E. coli tatC and tatAE mutant strains, showing that membrane translocation of the TorA-GFOR fusion protein occurred via the Tat pathway and not via the Sec pathway. Furthermore, tight cofactor binding (and therefore correct folding) was found to be a prerequisite for proper translocation of the fusion protein. These results strongly suggest that Tat signal peptides are not universally recognized by different Tat translocases, implying that the signal peptides of Tat-dependent precursor proteins are optimally adapted only to their cognate export apparatus. Such a situation is in marked contrast to the situation that is known to exist for Sec-dependent protein translocation.
TI  - Isolation of the dxr gene of Zymomonas mobilis and characterization of the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase.
AB  - The gene encoding the second enzyme of the 2C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate biosynthesis, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) reductoisomerase, was cloned and sequenced from Zymomonas mobilis. The deduced amino acid sequence showed the highest identity (48.2%) to the DXP reductoisomerase of Escherichia coli. Biochemical characterization of the purified DXP reductoisomerase showed a strict dependence of the enzyme on NADPH and divalent cations (Mn(2+), Co(2+) or Mg(2+)). The enzyme is a dimer with a molecular mass of 39 kDa per subunit and has a specific activity of 19.5 U mg protein(-1). Catalysis of the intramolecular rearrangement and reduction of DXP to MEP is competitively inhibited by the antibiotic fosmidomycin with a K(i) of 0.6 microM.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the levansucrase gene from Acetobacter xylinum NCI 1005.
AB  - The levansucrase gene (lsxA) was cloned from the genomic DNA of Acetobacter xylinum NCI 1005, and the nucleotide sequence of the lsxA gene (1,293 bp) was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the lsxA gene showed 57.4% and 46.2% identity with the levansucrases from Zymomonas mobilis and Erwinia amylovora, respectively, while only 35.2% identity with that from Acetobacter diazotrophicus. The gene product of lsxA (LsxA) that was overproduced in E. coli coded for a polypeptide of molecular mass 47 kDa. The LsxA released glucose and produced polysaccharide from sucrose, the structure of which was analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and determined to be a beta-(2,6)-linked polyfructan.
TI  - Ethanol production from glucose and xylose by immobilized Zymomonas mobilis CP4(pZB5).
AB  - Fermentation of glucose-xylose mixtures to ethanol was investigated in batch and  continuous experiments using immobilized recombinant Zymomonas mobilis CP4(pZB5). This microorganism was immobilized by entrapment in kappa-carrageenan beads having a diameter of 1.5-2.5 mm. Batch experiments showed that the immobilized cells cofermented glucose and xylose to ethanol and that the presence of glucose improved the xylose utilization rate. Batch fermentation of rice straw hydrolysate containing 76 g/L of glucose and 33.8 g/L of xylose gave an ethanol concentration of 44.3 g/L after 24 h, corresponding to a yield of 0.46 g of ethanol/g of sugars. Comparable results were achieved with a synthetic sugar control. Continuous fermentation experiments were performed in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed bioreactor (FBR). Glucose-xylose feed mixtures were pumped through the FBR at residence times of 2-4 h. Glucose conversion to ethanol was maintained above 98% in all experiments. Xylose conversion to ethanol was highest at 91.5% for a feed containing 50 g/L of glucose and 13 g/L of xylose at a dilution rate of 0.24/h. The xylose conversion to ethanol decreased with increasing feed xylose concentration, dilution rate, and age of the immobilized cells. Volumetric ethanol productivities in the range of 6.5-15.3 g/L.h were obtained. The improved productivities achieved in the FBR compared to other bioreactor systems can help in reducing the production costs of fuel ethanol from lignocellulosic sugars.
TI  - Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of acetic acid inhibition of rec Zymomonas mobilis ZM4(pZB5).
AB  - The fermentation characteristics and effects of lignocellulosic toxic compounds on recombinant Zymomonas mobilis ZM4(pZB5), which is capable of converting both glucose and xylose to ethanol, and its parental strain, ZM4, were characterized using 13C and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in vivo. From the 31P NMR data, the levels of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP) of ZM(pZB5) using xylose were lower than those of glucose. This can be related to the intrinsically slower assimilation and/or metabolism of xylose compared to glucose and is evidence of a less energized state of ZM4(pZB5) cells during xylose fermentation. Acetic acid was shown to be strongly inhibitory to ZM4(pZB5) on xylose medium, with xylose utilization being completely inhibited at pH 5.0 or lower in the presence of 10.9 g/L of sodium acetate. From the 31P NMR results, the addition of sodium acetate caused decreased NTP and sugar phosphates, together with acidification of the cytoplasm. Intracellular deenergization and acidification appear to be the major mechanisms by which acetic acid exerts its toxic effects on this recombinant strain.
TI  - Characterization of a high-productivity recombinant strain of Zymomonas mobilis for ethanol production from glucose/xylose mixtures.
AB  - The fermentation characteristics of a recombinant strain of Zymomonas mobilis ZM4(pZB5) capable of converting both glucose and xylose to ethanol have been further investigated. Previous studies have shown that the strain ZM4(pZB5) was capable of converting a mixture of 65 g/L of glucose and 65 g/L of xylose to 62 g/L of ethanol in 48 h with an overall yield of 0.46 g/g. Higher sugar concentrations (e.g., 75/75 g/L) resulted in incomplete xylose utilization (80 h). In the present study, further kinetic evaluations at high sugar levels are reported. Acetate inhibition studies and evaluation of temperature and pH effects indicated increased maximum specific uptake rates of glucose and xylose under stressed conditions with increased metabolic uncoupling. A high-productivity system was developed that involved a membrane bioreactor with cell recycling. At sugar concentrations of approx 50/50 g/L of glucose/xylose, an ethanol concentration of 50 g/L, an ethanol productivity of approx 5 g/(L.h), and a yield (YP/S) of 0.50 g/g were achieved. Decreases in cell viability were found in this system after attainment of an initial steady state (40-60 h); a slow bleed of concentrated cells may be required to overcome this problem.
TI  - Development of new ethanologenic Escherichia coli strains for fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass.
AB  - Two new ethanologenic strains (FBR4 and FBR5) of Escherichia coli were constructed and used to ferment corn fiber hydrolysate. The strains carry the plasmid pLOI297, which contains the genes from Zymomonas mobilis necessary for efficiently converting pyruvate into ethanol. Both strains selectively maintained the plasmid when grown anaerobically. Each culture was serially transferred 10 times in anaerobic culture with sugar-limited medium containing xylose, but no selective antibiotic. An average of 93 and 95% of the FBR4 and FBR5 cells, respectively, maintained pLOI297 in anaerobic culture. The fermentation performances of the repeatedly transferred cultures were compared with those of cultures freshly revived from stock in pH-controlled batch fermentations with 10% (w/v) xylose. Fermentation results were similar for all the cultures. Fermentations were completed within 60 h and ethanol yields were 86-92% of theoretical. Maximal ethanol concentrations were 3.9-4.2% (w/v). The strains were also tested for their ability to ferment corn fiber hydrolysate, which contained 8.5% (w/v) total sugars (2.0% arabinose, 2.8% glucose, and 3.7% xylose). E. coli FBR5 produced more ethanol than FBR4 from the corn fiber hydrolysate. E. coli FBR5 fermented all but 0.4% (w/v) of the available sugar, whereas strain FBR4 left 1.6% unconsumed. The fermentation with FBR5 was completed within 55 h and yielded 0.46 g of ethanol/g of available sugar, 90% of the maximum obtainable.
TI  - Refolding and purification of Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase produced as inclusion bodies in fed-batch culture of recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase was overproduced by the fed-batch culture of recombinant Escherichia coli harboring a novel expression system that is constitutively expressed by the promoter from the Rahnella aquatilis levansucrase gene. Most of the levansucrase was produced as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytoplasm, accounting for approximately 20% of the total cellular protein. Refolding after complete denaturation by high concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride was not successful, resulting in large amounts of insoluble aggregates. During the development of the refolding method, it was found that direct solubilization of the inclusion bodies with Triton X-100 reactivated the enzyme, with a considerable refolding efficiency. About 65% of inclusion body levansucrase was refolded into active levansucrase in the renaturation buffer containing 4% (v/v) Triton X-100. The in vitro refolded enzyme was purified to 95% purity by single-step DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography. Triton X-100 was removed by this ion exchange chromatography.
TI  - Effects of acetate on the growth and fermentation performance of Escherichia coli KO11.
AB  - Escherichia coli KO11, in which the genes pdc (pyruvate decarboxylase) and adh (alcohol dehydrogenase) encoding the ethanol pathway from Zymomonas mobilis were inserted into the chromosome, has been shown to metabolize all major sugars that are constituents of hemicellulosic hydrolysates to ethanol, in anaerobic conditions. However, the growth and fermentation performance of this recombinant bacteria may be affected by acetic acid, a potential inhibitor present in hemicellulose hydrolysates in a range of 2.0-15.0 g/L. It was observed that acetate affected the growth of E. coli KO11, prolonging the lag phase and inducing loss of biomass production and reduction of growth rate. At lower pH levels, the sensitivity to acetic acid was enhanced owing to the increased concentration of the protonated species. On the other hand, the recombinant bacteria showed a high tolerance to acetic acid regarding fermentative performance. In Luria broth medium with glucose or xylose as a single sugar source, it was observed that neither yield nor productivity was affected by the addition of acetate in a range of 2.0-12.0 g/L, suggesting some uncoupling of the growth vs ethanol production.
TI  - Altered regulation of pyruvate kinase or co-overexpression of phosphofructokinase increases glycolytic fluxes in resting Escherichia coli.
AB  - Glycolytic fluxes in resting Escherichia coli were enhanced by overexpression of  heterologous pyruvate kinases (Pyk) from Bacillus stearothermophilus and Zymomonas mobilis, but not homologous Pyk. Compared to the control, an increase of 10% in specific glucose consumption and of 15% in specific ethanol production rates was found in anaerobic resting cells, expressing the heterologous Pyks, that were harvested from exponentially growing aerobic cultures. A further increase in glycolytic flux was achieved by simultaneous overexpression of E. coli phosphofructokinase (Pfk) and Pyk with specific glucose consumption and ethanol production rates of 25% and 35% greater, respectively, than the control. Fluxes to lactate were not significantly affected, contrary to previous observations with resting cells harvested from anaerobically growing cultures. To correlate the physiology of resting cells with the physiology of cells prior to harvest, we determined the relevant growth parameters from aerobic and anaerobic precultures. We conclude that glycolytic fluxes in E. coli with submaximal (aerobic) metabolic activity can be increased by overexpression of pyruvate kinases which do not require allosteric activation or co-overexpression with Pfk. However, such improvements require more extensive engineering in E. coli with near maximal (anaerobic) metabolic activity.
TI  - Molecular characterization of squalene synthase from the green microalga Botryococcus braunii, race B.
AB  - The green microalga Botryococcus braunii produces large amounts of liquid hydrocarbons and is classified into three races, depending on the type of the hydrocarbon produced. The B race produces two types of triterpenoid hydrocarbons, squalene and botryococcene, both of which are putative condensation products of farnesyl diphosphate. In an attempt to better understand the regulation involved in the production of squalene and botryococcene, we have isolated and characterized a squalene synthase (SS) gene from the B race of B. braunii. A 366-bp cDNA fragment was initially obtained from the B race utilizing a reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction and degenerate primers based on conserved amino acid sequences found in all SS enzymes. Using this putative SS fragment as a probe, a 2632-bp cDNA clone was isolated from a cDNA library. This cDNA contained an open reading frame coding for a protein with 461 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 52.5 kDa. Comparison of the Botryococcus SS (BSS) with SS from different organisms showed 52% identity with Nicotiana tabacum, 51% with Arabidopsis thaliana, 48% with Zea mays, 40% with rat, 39% with yeast, and 26% with Zymomonas mobilis. Expression of full-length and carboxy-terminus truncated BSS cDNA in Escherichia coli resulted in significant levels of bacterial SS enzyme activity but no botryococcene synthase activity. RNA blot hybridization analysis of algal cultures during a culture cycle indicated that BSS gene expression is preferential during rapid growth. Given that the DNA blot analysis indicated only a single copy of the SS gene in the algal genome, these results suggest either that there exists coordinate expression of separate synthase genes for squalene and botryococcene biosynthesis or that there might be unique physiological conditions controlling the SS vs botryococcene synthase activity of a single peptide species.
TI  - Probing the location and function of the conserved histidine residue of phosphoglucose isomerase by using an active site directed inhibitor N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate.
AB  - Phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) catalyzes the interconversion of D-glucopyranose-6-phosphate and D-fructofuranose-6-phosphate by promoting an intrahydrogen transfer between C1 and C2. A conserved histidine exists throughout all phosphoglucose isomerases and was hypothesized to be the base catalyzing the isomerization reaction. In the present study, this conserved histidine, His311, of the enzyme from Bacillus stearothermophilus was subjected to mutational analysis, and the mutational effect on the inactivation kinetics by N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate was investigated. The substitution of His311 with alanine, asparagine, or glutamine resulted in the decrease of activity, in k(cat)/K(M), by a factor of 10(3), indicating the importance of this residue. N-bromoacetylethanolamine phosphate inactivated irreversibly the activity of wild-type phosphoglucose isomerase; however, His311 --> Ala became resistant to this inhibitor, indicating that His311 is located in the active site and is responsible for the inactivation of the enzyme by this active site-directed inhibitor. The pKa of His311 was estimated to be 6.31 according to the pH dependence of the inactivation. The proximity of this value with the pKa value of 6.35, determined from the pH dependence of k(cat)/K(M), supports a role of His311 as a general base in the catalysis.
TI  - Chromosomal integration of heterologous DNA in Escherichia coli with precise removal of markers and replicons used during construction.
AB  - A set of vectors which facilitates the sequential integration of new functions into the Escherichia coli chromosome by homologous recombination has been developed. These vectors are based on plasmids described by Posfai et al. (J. Bacteriol. 179:4426-4428, 1997) which contain conditional replicons (pSC101 or R6K), a choice of three selectable markers (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or kanamycin), and a single FRT site. The modified vectors contain two FRT sites which bracket a modified multiple cloning region for DNA insertion. After integration, a helper plasmid expressing the flippase (FLP) recombinase allows precise in vivo excision of the replicon and the marker used for selection. Sites are also available for temporary insertion of additional functions which can be subsequently deleted with the replicon. Only the DNA inserted into the multiple cloning sites (passenger genes and homologous fragment for targeting) and a single FRT site (68 bp) remain in the chromosome after excision. The utility of these vectors was demonstrated by integrating Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding the ethanol pathway behind the native chromosomal adhE gene in strains of E. coli K-12 and E. coli B. With these vectors, a single antibiotic selection system can be used repeatedly for the successive improvement of E. coli strains with precise deletion of extraneous genes used during construction.
TI  - Biosynthetic burden and plasmid burden limit expression of chromosomally integrated heterologous genes (pdc, adhB) in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Previous studies have shown an unexpectedly high nutrient requirement for efficient ethanol production by ethanologenic recombinants of Escherichia coli B such as LY01 which contain chromosomally integrated Zymomonas mobilis genes (pdc,adhB) encoding the ethanol pathway. The basis for this requirement has been identified as a media-dependent effect on the expression of the Z. mobilis genes rather than a nutritional limitation. Ethanol production was substantially increased without additional nutrients simply by increasing the level of pyruvate decarboxylase activity. This was accomplished by adding a multicopy plasmid containing pdc alone (but not adhB alone) to strain LY01, and by adding multicopy plasmids which express pdc and adhB from strong promoters. New strong promoters were isolated from random fragments of Z. mobilis DNA and characterized but were not used to construct integrated biocatalysts. These promoters contained regions resembling recognition sites for 3 different E. coli sigma factors: sigma(70), sigma(38), and sigma(28). The most effective plasmid-based promoters for fermentation were recognized by multiple sigma factors, expressed both pdc and adhB at high levels, and produced ethanol efficiently while allowing up to 80% reduction in complex nutrients as compared to LY01. The ability to utilize multiple sigma factors may be advantageous to maintain the high levels of PDC and ADH needed for efficient ethanol production throughout batch fermentation. From this work, we propose that the activation of biosynthetic genes in nutrient-poor media creates a biosynthetic burden that reduces the expression of chromosomal pdc and adhB by competing for transcriptional and translational machinery. This reduced expression can be viewed as analogous to the effect of plasmids (plasmid burden) on the expression of native chromosomal genes.
TI  - Fermentations with new recombinant organisms.
AB  - United States fuel ethanol production in 1998 exceeded the record production of 1.4 billion gallons set in 1995. Most of this ethanol was produced from over 550 million bushels of corn. Expanding fuel ethanol production will require developing lower-cost feedstocks, and only lignocellulosic feedstocks are available in sufficient quantities to substitute for corn starch. Major technical hurdles to converting lignocellulose to ethanol include the lack of low-cost efficient enzymes for saccharification of biomass to fermentable sugars and the development of microorganisms for the fermentation of these mixed sugars. To date, the most successful research approaches to develop novel biocatalysts that will efficiently ferment mixed sugar syrups include isolation of novel yeasts that ferment xylose, genetic engineering of Escherichia coli and other gram negative bacteria for ethanol production, and genetic engineering of Saccharoymces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis for pentose utilization. We have evaluated the fermentation of corn fiber hydrolyzates by the various strains developed. E. coli K011, E. coli SL40, E. coli FBR3, Zymomonas CP4 (pZB5), and Saccharomyces 1400 (pLNH32) fermented corn fiber hydrolyzates to ethanol in the range of 21-34 g/L with yields ranging from 0.41 to 0.50 g of ethanol per gram of sugar consumed. Progress with new recombinant microorganisms has been rapid and will continue with the eventual development of organisms suitable for commercial ethanol production. Each research approach holds considerable promise, with the possibility existing that different "industrially hardened" strains may find separate applications in the fermentation of specific feedstocks.
TI  - Enteric bacterial catalysts for fuel ethanol production.
AB  - The technology is available to produce fuel ethanol from renewable lignocellulosic biomass. The current challenge is to assemble the various process options into a commercial venture and begin the task of incremental improvement. Current process designs for lignocellulose are far more complex than grain to ethanol processes. This complexity results in part from the complexity of the substrate and the biological limitations of the catalyst. Our work at the University of Florida has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of Enteric bacteria using genes encoding Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. These two genes have been assembled into a portable ethanol production cassette, the PET operon, and integrated into the chromosome of Escherichia coli B for use with hemicellulose-derived syrups. The resulting strain, KO11, produces ethanol efficiently from all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. By using the same approach, we integrated the PET operon into the chromosome of Klebsiella oxytoca to produce strain P2 for use in the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process for cellulose. Strain P2 has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. Recently, the ability to produce and secrete high levels of endoglucanase has also been added to strain P2, further reducing the requirement for fungal cellulase. The general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts using the PET operon has been most successful with Enteric bacteria but was also extended to Gram positive bacteria, which have other useful traits for lignocellulose conversion. Many opportunities remain for further improvements in these biocatalysts as we proceed toward the development of single organisms that can be used for the efficient fermentation of both hemicellulosic and cellulosic substrates.
TI  - Exceptional characteristics of heterotetrameric (alpha 2 beta 2) E1p of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from Zymomonas mobilis: expression from an own promoter and a lipoyl domain in E1 beta.
AB  - In the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) of Zymomonas mobilis the beta subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1p) as well as the acetyltransferase (E2p) contain an N-terminal lipoyl domain. Both lipoyl domains were acetylated in vitro using 2-14C-pyruvate as a substrate, demonstrating that both lipoyl domains can accept acetyl groups from the E1 component. As previously shown the structural genes (pdhA alpha beta, pdhB, lpd) encoding the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex of Z. mobilis are located in two distinct gene clusters, pdhA alpha beta and pdhB-orf2-lpd (U. Neveling et al. (1998) J. Bacteriol. 180, 1540-1548). Analysis of pdh gene expression using lacZ fusions revealed that the DNA fragments upstream of pdhA alpha, pdhB and lpd each have promoter activities. These pdh promoter activities were 7-30-fold higher in Z. mobilis than in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the beta-fructofuranosidase gene from Bacillus sp. V230.
AB  - The beta-fructofuranosidase gene (bff) from Bacillus sp. V230 has been cloned in  Escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been analyzed. The product of bff consists of a signal sequence of 32 amino acid (a.a.) residues for secretion and 455 a.a. residues of the extracellular beta-fructofuranosidase. The a.a. sequence of the bff product has similarities with those of the Bacillus subtilis levanscrase (63.7% identity), the Streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase (33.7%), and the Zymomonas mobilis levanscrase and beta-fructofuranosidase (15%).
TI  - Mutagenesis and crystallographic studies of Zymomonas mobilis tRNA-guanine transglycosylase to elucidate the role of serine 103 for enzymatic activity.
AB  - The tRNA modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is involved in the  exchange of guanine in the first position of the anticodon with preQ1 as part of the biosynthesis of the hypermodified base queuine (Q). Mutation of Ser90 to an alanine in Escherichia coli TGT leads to a dramatic reduction of enzymatic activity (Reuter, K. et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 7041-7046). To further clarify the role of this residue in the catalytic center, we have mutated the corresponding Ser103 of the crystallizable Zymomonas mobilis TGT into alanine. The crystal structure of a TGT(S103A)/preQ1 complex combined with biochemical data presented in this paper suggest that Ser103 is essential for substrate orientation in the TGT reaction.
TI  - The efficient export of NADP-containing glucose-fructose oxidoreductase to the periplasm of Zymomonas mobilis depends both on an intact twin-arginine motif in the signal peptide and on the generation of a structural export signal induced by cofactor binding.
AB  - The periplasmic, NADP-containing glucose-fructose oxidoreductase of the gram-negative bacterium Zymomonas mobilis belongs to a class of redox cofactor-dependent enzymes which are exported with the aid of a signal peptide containing a so-called twin-arginine motif. In this paper we show that the replacement of one or both arginine residues results in drastically reduced translocation of glucose-fructose oxidoreductase to the periplasm, showing that this motif is essential. Mutant proteins which, in contrast to wild-type glucose-fructose oxidoreductase, bind NADP in a looser and dissociable manner, were severely affected in the kinetics of plasma membrane translocation. These results strongly suggest that the translocation of glucose-fructose oxidoreductase into the periplasm uses a Sec-independent apparatus which recognizes, as an additional signal, a conformational change in the structure of the protein, most likely triggered by cofactor binding. Furthermore, these results suggest that glucose-fructose oxidoreductase is exported in a folded form. A glucose-fructose oxidoreductase:beta-galactosidase fusion protein is not lethal to Z. mobilis cells and leads to the accumulation of the cytosolic preform of wild-type glucose-fructose oxidoreductase expressed in trans but not of a typical Sec-substrate (OmpA), indicating that the glucose-fructose oxidoreductase translocation apparatus can be blocked without interfering with the export of essential proteins via the Sec pathway.
TI  - Enhancement of expression and apparent secretion of Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase (encoded by celZ) in Escherichia coli B.
AB  - Escherichia coli B has been engineered as a biocatalyst for the conversion of lignocellulose into ethanol. Previous research has demonstrated that derivatives of E. coli B can produce high levels of Erwinia chrysanthemi endoglucanase (encoded by celZ) as a periplasmic product and that this enzyme can function with commercial fungal cellulase to increase ethanol production. In this study, we have demonstrated two methods that improve celZ expression in E. coli B. Initially, with a low-copy-number vector, two E. coli glycolytic gene promoters (gap and eno) were tested and found to be less effective than the original celZ promoter. By screening 18,000 random fragments of Zymomonas mobilis DNA, a surrogate promoter was identified which increased celZ expression up to sixfold. With this promoter, large polar inclusion bodies were clearly evident in the periplasmic space. Sequencing revealed that the most active surrogate promoter is derived from five Sau3A1 fragments, one of which was previously sequenced in Z. mobilis. Visual inspection indicated that this DNA fragment contains at least five putative promoter regions, two of which were confirmed by primer extension analysis. Addition of the out genes from E. chrysanthemi EC16 caused a further increase in the production of active enzyme and facilitated secretion or release of over half of the activity into the extracellular environment. With the most active construct, of a total of 13,000 IU of active enzyme per liter of culture, 7,800 IU was in the supernatant. The total active endoglucanase was estimated to represent 4 to 6% of cellular protein.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of bacteria for ethanol production
AB  - Technologies are available which will allow the conversion of lignocellulose into fuel ethanol using genetically engineered bacteria. Assembling these into a cost-effective process remains a challenge. Our work has focused primarily on the genetic engineering of enteric bacteria using a portable ethanol production pathway. Genes encoding Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase have been integrated into the chromosome of Escherichia coli B to produce strain KO11 for the fermentation of hemicellulose-derived syrups. This organism can efficiently ferment all hexose and pentose sugars present in the polymers of hemicellulose. Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 has been genetically engineered in a similar manner to produce strain P2 for ethanol production from cellulose. This organism has the native ability to ferment cellobiose and cellotriose, eliminating the need for one class of cellulase enzymes. The optimal pH for cellulose fermentation with this organism (pH 5.0-5.5) is near that of fungal cellulases. The general approach for the genetic engineering of new biocatalysts has been most successful with enteric bacteria thus far. However, this approach may also prove useful with Gram-positive bacteria which have other important traits for lignocellulose conversion. Many opportunities remain for further improvements in the biomass to ethanol processes. These include the development of enzyme-based systems which eliminate the need for dilute acid hydrolysis or other pretreatments, improvements in existing pretreatments for enzymatic hydrolysis, process improvements to increase the effective use of cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes, improvements in rates of ethanol production, decreased nutrient costs, increases in ethanol concentrations achieved in biomass beers, increased resistance of the biocatalysts to lignocellulosic-derived toxins, etc. To be useful, each of these improvements must result in a decrease in the cost for ethanol production.

TI  - Application of mathematical tools for metabolic design of microbial ethanol production.
AB  - Many attempts to engineer cellular metabolism have failed due to the complexity of cellular functions. Mathematical and computational methods are needed that can organize the available experimental information, and provide insight and guidance for successful metabolic engineering. Two such methods are reviewed here. Both methods employ a (log)linear kinetic model of metabolism that is constructed based on enzyme kinetics characteristics. The first method allows the description of the dynamic responses of metabolic systems subject to spatiotemporal variations in their parameters. The second method considers the product-oriented, constrained optimization of metabolic reaction networks using mixed-integer linear programming methods. The optimization framework is used in order to identify the combinations of the metabolic characteristics of the glycolytic enzymes from yeast and bacteria that will maximize ethanol production. The methods are also applied to the design of microbial ethanol production metabolism. The results of the calculations are in qualitative agreement with experimental data presented here. Experiments and calculations suggest that, in resting Escherichia coli cells, ethanol production and glucose uptake rates can be increased by 30% and 20%, respectively, by overexpression of a deregulated pyruvate kinase, while increase in phosphofructokinase expression levels has no effect on ethanol production and glucose uptake rates.
TI  - Complement activation by bacterial surface glycolipids: a study with planar bilayer membranes.
AB  - Planar asymmetric glycolipid/phospholipid bilayer membranes were used as a reconstitution model of the lipid matrix of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria to study complement (C) activation by various bacterial surface glycolipids with the aim of defining the C activation pathway. As glycolipids the lipopolysaccharides of Salmonella enterica serovar Minnesota R mutant strains R595 (Re LPS) and R4 (Rd2 LPS), pentaacyl lipid A from the LPS of the Escherichia coli Re mutant F515, and glycosphingolipid GSL-1 of Sphingomonas paucimobilis IAM 12576 were used. Methylester and carboxyl-reduced derivatives of GSL-1 were used to elucidate the role of the carboxyl group as common functional group of LPS and GSL-1 for C activation. The formation of lytic pores was monitored via the measurement of changes in membrane current. For all glycolipids we observed a considerable increase in membrane current soon after addition of whole human serum due to the formation of lytic pores in the membranes. Pore formation was dependent on the presence of C9, indicating that the observed current changes were due to C activation. We found that in our reconstitution system of the outer membrane lipid A, Re LPS, and Rd2 LPS activated the classical pathway, the activation being independent of specific anti-LPS antibodies. In contrast, GSL-1 and the methylester derivative of GSL-1 activated the alternative pathway even at the low serum concentrations used in this study (about 0.2% v/v). Interestingly, the carboxyl reduced GSL-1 activated the classical pathway.

TI  - Expression of the extracellular levansucrase and invertase genes from Zymomonas mobilis in Escherichia coli cells.
AB  - We investigated the expression and localization in Escherichia coli of sucZE2 and sucZE3, encoding Zymomonas mobilis extracellular levansucrase and invertase, respectively, and lacking a typical N-terminal secretion signal. Levansucrase and invertase were expressed efficiently under the lac and tac promoters in E. coli cells, and some of the levansucrase produced was localized in the periplasmic space. The sucZE2 expression was not lethal to E. coli in the presence of 5% sucrose, and led to the accumulation of levan from sucrose.
TI  - Lactone-ring-cleaving enzyme: genetic analysis, novel RNA editing, and evolutionary implications.
AB  - A lactonohydrolase from Fusarium oxysporum AKU 3702 is an enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of aldonate lactones to the corresponding aldonic acids. The amino acid sequences of the NH2 terminus and internal peptide fragments of the enzyme were determined to prepare synthetic oligonucleotides as primers for the PCR. An approximate 1, 000-base genomic DNA fragment thus amplified was used as the probe to clone both genomic DNA and cDNA for the enzyme. The lactonohydrolase genomic gene consists of six exons separated by five short introns. A novel type of RNA editing, in which lactonohydrolase mRNA included the insertion of guanosine and cytidine residues, was observed. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned lactonohydrolase cDNA showed significant similarity to those of the gluconolactonase from Zymomonas mobilis, and paraoxonases from human and rabbit, forming a unique superfamily consisting of C-O cleaving enzymes and P-O cleaving enzymes. Lactonohydrolase was expressed under the control of the lac promoter in Escherichia coli.
TI  - Novel selection for isoniazid (INH) resistance genes supports a role for NAD+-binding proteins in mycobacterial INH resistance.
AB  - The genetic basis of isoniazid (INH) resistance remains unknown for a significant proportion of clinical isolates. To identify genes which might confer resistance by detoxifying or sequestering INH, we transformed the Escherichia coli oxyR mutant, which is relatively sensitive to INH, with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis plasmid library and selected for INH-resistant clones. Three genes were identified and called ceo for their ability to complement the Escherichia coli oxyR mutant. ceoA was the previously identified M. tuberculosis glf gene, which encodes a 399-amino-acid NAD+- and flavin adenine dinucleotide-requiring enzyme responsible for catalyzing the conversion of UDP-galactopyranose to UDP-galactofuranose. The proteins encoded by the ceoBC pair were homologous with one another and with the N terminus of the potassium uptake regulatory protein TrkA. Each of the three Ceo proteins contains a motif common to NAD+ binding pockets. Overexpression of the M. tuberculosis glf gene by placing it under the control of the hsp60 promoter on a multicopy plasmid in Mycobacterium bovis BCG produced a strain for which the INH MIC was increased 50% compared to that for the control strains, while similar overexpression of the ceoBC pair had no effect on INH susceptibility in BCG. Mycobacterial extracts containing the overexpressed Glf protein did not bind radiolabeled INH directly, suggesting a more complex mechanism than the binding of unmodified INH. Our results support the hypothesis that upregulated mycobacterial proteins such as Glf may contribute to INH resistance in M. tuberculosis by binding a modified form of INH or by sequestering a factor such as NAD+ required for INH activity.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate kinase gene in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The homotetrameric pyruvate kinases (PK) constitute a fine example of allosteric  enzymes subjected to sophisticated regulatory mechanisms. We have cloned and sequenced the Zymomonas mobilis structural gene for the first prokaryotic dimeric PK, as an initial step toward understanding the peculiar properties of this enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence of the pyk gene consists of 475 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 51.4kDa and exhibits up to 50% sequence identity with other PKs. Heterologous expression in Escherichia coli was not obtained from the native promoter, but only when the pyk gene was under the control of a strong inducible promoter when a ribosome-binding site was present upstream of the putative TTG start codon of the pyk gene. Kinetic characterization of PK in concentrated crude cell extracts showed that the enzyme is not activated by sugar phosphates or AMP but is slightly inhibited by ATP. Thus, PK of Z. mobilis is unique among the characterized prokaryotic PKs due to its high activity in the absence of any allosteric activator. Amino acid sequence alignments revealed that glutamate 381 may play a role in ineffective binding of the usual PK activator, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and expression in Escherichia coli of levansucrase  genes from the plant pathogens Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola.
AB  - Plant-pathogenic bacteria produce various extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs) which may function as virulence factors in diseases caused by these bacteria. The EPS levan is synthesized by the extracellular enzyme levansucrase in Pseudomonas syringae, Erwinia amylovora, and other bacterial species. The lsc genes encoding levansucrase from P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 and P. syringae pv. phaseolicola NCPPB 1321 were cloned, and their nucleotide sequences were determined. Heterologous expression of the lsc gene in Escherichia coli was found in four and two genomic library clones of strains PG4180 and NCPPB 1321, respectively. A 3. 0-kb PstI fragment common to all six clones conferred levan synthesis on E. coli when further subcloned. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a 1,248-bp open reading frame (ORF) derived from PG4180 and a 1,296-bp ORF derived from NCPPB 1321, which were both designated lsc. Both ORFs showed high homology to the E. amylovora and Zymomonas mobilis lsc genes at the nucleic acid and deduced amino acid sequence levels. Levansucrase was not secreted into the supernatant but was located in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli harboring the lsc gene. Expression of lsc was found to be dependent on the vector-based Plac promoter, indicating that the native promoter of lsc was not functional in E. coli. Insertion of an antibiotic resistance cassette in the lsc gene abolished levan synthesis in E. coli. A PCR screening with primers derived from lsc of P. syringae pv. glycinea PG4180 allowed the detection of this gene in a number of related bacteria.
TI  - Cloning of conserved genes from Zymomonas mobilis and Bradyrhizobium japonicum that function in the biosynthesis of hopanoid lipids.
AB  - The squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC) is the only enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of hopanoid lipids that has been characterized on the genetic level. To investigate if additional genes involved in hopanoid biosynthesis are clustered with the shc gene, we cloned and analyzed the nucleotide sequences located immediately upstream of the shc genes from Zymomonas mobilis and Bradyrhizobium japonicum. In Z. mobilis, five open reading frames (ORFs, designated as hpnA-E) were detected in a close arrangement with the shc gene. In B. japonicum, three similarly arranged ORFs (corresponding to hpnC-E from Z. mobilis) were found. The deduced amino acid sequences of hpnC-E showed significant similarity (58-62%) in both bacteria. Similarities to enzymes of other terpenoid biosynthesis pathways (carotenoid and steroid biosynthesis) suggest that these ORFs encode proteins involved in the biosynthesis of hopanoids and their intermediates. Expression of hpnC to hpnE from Z. mobilis as well as expression of hpnC from B. japonicum in Escherichia coli led to the formation of the hopanoid precursor squalene. This indicates that hpnC encodes a squalene synthase. The two additional ORFs (hpnA and hpnB) in Z. mobilis showed similarities to enzymes involved in the transfer and modification of sugars, indicating that they may code for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the complex, sugar-containing side chains of hopanoids.
TI  - Increased cellulose production from sucrose with reduced levan accumulation by an Acetobacter strain harboring a recombinant plasmid.
AB  - Cellulose production from sucrose by Acetobacter strains is accompanied by the accumulation of a water-soluble polysaccharide, called levan. To improve cellulose productivity, a levansucrase-deficient mutant, LD-2, was derived from Acetobacter strain 757 and used as a host for the construction of recombinant strains. An LD-2 mutant harboring a plasmid containing the sucrase gene, sucZE3, from Zymomonas mobilis together with zliS, a gene that encodes a secretion-activating factor under the control of the Escherichia coli lac promoter, had sucrase activity and produced much cellulose and little levan in a medium containing sucrose. In addition, a mutant levansucrase gene, mutant sacB, from Bacillus subtilis, which encodes a protein with little levan-forming activity, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and introduced into the LD-2 mutant. This introduction also resulted in the higher cellulose productivity and little levan.
TI  - Cloning of a Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6 gene encoding a novel oxygenase that cleaves lignin-related biphenyl and characterization of the enzyme.
AB  - Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6 transforms 2,2'-dihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-5,5'-dicarboxybiphenyl (DDVA), a lignin-related biphenyl compound, to 5-carboxyvanillic acid via 2,2',3-trihydroxy-3'-methoxy-5,5'-dicarboxybiphenyl (OH-DDVA) as an intermediate (15). The ring fission of OH-DDVA is an essential step in the DDVA degradative pathway. A 15-kb EcoRI fragment isolated from the cosmid library complemented the growth deficiency of a mutant on OH-DDVA. Subcloning and deletion analysis showed that a 1.4-kb DNA fragment included the gene responsible for the ring fission of OH-DDVA. An open reading frame encoding 334 amino acids was identified and designated ligZ. The deduced amino acid sequence of LigZ had 18 to 21% identity with the class III extradiol dioxygenase family, including the beta subunit (LigB) of protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase of SYK-6 (Y. Noda, S. Nishikawa, K.-I. Shiozuka, H. Kadokura, H. Nakajima, K. Yano, Y. Katayama, N. Morohoshi, T. Haraguchi, and M. Yamasaki, J. Bacteriol. 172:2704-2709, 1990), catechol 2,3-dioxygenase I (MpcI) of Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP222 (M. Kabisch and P. Fortnagel, Nucleic Acids Res. 18:3405-3406, 1990), the catalytic subunit of the meta-cleavage enzyme (CarBb) for 2'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol from Pseudomonas sp. strain CA10 (S. I. Sato, N. Ouchiyama, T. Kimura, H. Nojiri, H. Yamane, and T. Omori, J. Bacteriol. 179:4841-4849, 1997), and 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionate 1,2-dioxygenase (MhpB) of Escherichia coli (E. L. Spence, M. Kawamukai, J. Sanvoisin, H. Braven, and T. D. H. Bugg, J. Bacteriol. 178:5249-5256, 1996). The ring fission product formed from OH-DDVA by LigZ developed a yellow color with an absorption maximum at 455 nm, suggesting meta cleavage. Thus, LigZ was concluded to be a ring cleavage extradiol dioxygenase. LigZ activity was detected only for OH-DDVA and 2,2',3,3'-tetrahydroxy-5,5'-dicarboxybiphenyl and was dependent on the ferrous ion.
TI  - Surface display of Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase by using the ice-nucleation protein of Pseudomonas syringae.
AB  - The ice-nucleation protein (Inp) is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored outer membrane protein found in some Gram-negative bacteria. Using Pseudomonas syringae inp as an anchoring motif, we investigated the functional display of a foreign protein, Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase (LevU), on the surface of Escherichia coli. The cells expressing Inp-LevU were found to retain both the ice-nucleation and whole-cell levansucrase enzyme activities, indicating the functional expression of Inp-LevU hybrid protein on the cell surface. The surface localization was further verified by immunofluorescence microscopy, fluorescence-activated cell sorting flow cytometry and immunogold electron microscopical examination. No growth inhibition or changes in the outer membrane integrity were observed upon the induction of fusion protein synthesis. Viability of the cells was also maintained over 48 hours in the stationary phase. Surface-displayed levansucrases were found to be resistant to the externally added proteases unless the cells were treated with EDTA. When the levansucrase-displayed cells were used as the enzyme source, levan (44 g/L) was efficiently synthesized from sucrose (130 g/L) with 34% (wt/wt) conversion yield, generating glucose (65 g/L) as a by-product.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of ethanol-tolerant mutants of Escherichia coli KO11 for fuel ethanol production.
AB  - Genetically engineered Escherichia coli KO11 is capable of efficiently producing  ethanol from all sugar constituents of lignocellulose but lacks the high ethanol tolerance of yeasts currently used for commercial starch-based ethanol processes. Using an enrichment method which selects alternatively for ethanol tolerance during growth in broth and for ethanol production on solid medium, mutants of KO11 with increased ethanol tolerance were isolated which can produce more than 60 g ethanol L-1 from xylose in 72 h. Ethanol concentrations and yields achieved by the LY01 mutant with xylose exceed those reported for recombinant strains of Saccharomyces and Zymomonas mobilis, both of which have a high native ethanol tolerance.
TI  - Isolation and molecular characterization of high-performance cellobiose-fermenting spontaneous mutants of ethanologenic Escherichia coli KO11 containing the Klebsiella oxytoca casAB operon.
AB  - Escherichia coli KO11 was previously constructed to produce ethanol from acid hydrolysates of hemicellulose (pentoses and hexoses) by the chromosomal integration of Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhB). Klebsiella oxytoca P2 was constructed in an analogous fashion for the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of cellulose and contains PTS enzymes for cellobiose. In this study, KO11 was further engineered for the fermentation of cellulose by adding the K. oxytoca casAB genes encoding Enzyme IIcellobiose and phospho-beta-glucosidase. Although the two K. oxytoca genes were well expressed in cloning hosts such as DH5 alpha, both were expressed poorly in E. coli KO11, a derivative of E. coli B. Spontaneous mutants which exhibited more than 15-fold-higher specific activities for cellobiose metabolism were isolated. The mutations of these mutants resided in the plasmid rather than the host. Three mutants were characterized by sequence analysis. All contained similar internal deletions which eliminated the casAB promoter and operator regions and placed the lacZ Shine-Dalgarno region immediately upstream from the casA Shine-Dalgarno region. KO11 harboring mutant plasmids (pLOI1908, pLOI1909, or pLOI1910) rapidly fermented cellobiose to ethanol, and the yield was more than 90% of the theoretical yield. Two of these strains were used with commercial cellulase to ferment mixed-waste office paper to ethanol.
TI  - The role of His113 and His114 in pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) is one of several enzymes that require thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) and a divalent cation as essential cofactors. Recently, the three-dimensional structures of the enzyme from two yeasts have been determined. While these structures shed light on the binding of the cofactors and the reaction mechanism, the interactions between the substrate pyruvate and the enzyme remain unclear. We have used PDC from Zymomonas mobilis as a model for these enzymes in order to study substrate binding. The recombinant enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli. High yield, simplicity of purification, high stability and simple kinetics make this model well suited for these studies. Activity measurements in the pH range between 5.8 and 8.5 indicated that a His residue may be involved in substrate binding. Analysis of an alignment of all known PDC protein sequences showed two invariant His residues (His113 and His114) which, according to the crystal structure of yeast PDC, are in the vicinity of the active site. Here we demonstrate that replacement of His114 by Gln does not have a great effect on cofactor and substrate binding. However, the k(cat) is decreased indicating that His114 may assist in catalysis. In contrast, substitution of His113 by Gln renders the enzyme completely inactive. This mutant has decreased affinity for both cofactors, as revealed by measurements of tryptophan fluorescence quenching. However, this decreased affinity is insufficient to account for the complete loss of activity. Despite its inability to support overall catalysis, this [Gln113]PDC mutant is capable of releasing acetaldehyde from 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)thiamin diphosphate supplied exogenously. It is proposed that upon substrate binding, His113 is placed close to C2 of the thiazole ring. Subsequent deprotonation of this atom leads to a conformational change that allows a flexible loop (residues 105-112) that precedes His113 to close over the active site. Hence, replacement of His113 by another residue interferes with this closure of the active site and thus disrupts the catalytic process.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of flavonoids from leaves of Tagetes minuta.
AB  - The total extract and fractions with different solvents, obtained from leaves of  Tagetes minuta, showed several degrees of antimicrobial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative microorganisms. The same fractions were inactive against Lactobacillus, Zymomonas and Saccharomices species. The major component of the extract: quercetagetin-7-arabinosyl-galactoside, showed significant antimicrobial activity on pathogen microorganisms tested. Correlation results were carried out using chloramphenicol as standard antibiotic.
TI  - Squalene-hopene cyclase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum: cloning, expression, sequence analysis and comparison to other triterpenoid cyclases.
AB  - With the help of a PCR-based screening method, the gene encoding squalenehopene cyclase (SHC) of Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 was isolated from a cosmid library. The SHC catalyses the cyclization of squalene to hopanoids, a class of triterpenoid lipids recently discovered in nitrogen-fixing, root-nodule-forming Bradyrhizobium bacteria. Hybridization experiments showed that the gene is present in bacteria of all Bradyrhizobium strains tested and in photosynthetic bacteria forming stem nodules on tropical legumes of the genus Aeschynomene. The Bradyrhizobium shc gene is 1983 bp in length and encodes a protein of 660 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 73671 Da. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the sequences of other SHCs revealed highest similarity (70%) to the SHC from the Gram-negative Zymomonas mobilis and lower similarity (48%) to the SHCs from the Gram-positive Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris. Bradyrhizobium SHC also showed similarity (38-43%) to eukaryotic oxidosqualene cyclases. The B. japonicum shc gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant SHC catalysed the cyclization of squalene to the hopanoids hopene and diplopterol in vitro. However, the formation of the gammacerane derivative tetrahymanol, which is produced in addition to hopanoids in B. japonicum strains in vivo, could not be detected in vitro. Therefore, the presence of a second squalene cyclase in B. japonicum can be assumed. Sequence analysis of 0.5 kb upstream from the shc gene identified a partial ORF with significant similarity to the C-terminus of an ORF located immediately upstream from the shc gene in Z. mobilis. Both ORFs also showed similarity to phytoene desaturases from cyanobacteria and plants. The 3'-end of this ORF from B. japonicum overlaps with 13 bp at the 5'-end of shc. The close proximity of this ORF to shc suggests that shc and this ORF may be part of an operon.

TI  - Transposon mutagenesis and strain construction in Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Conjugative or mobilizable plasmids carrying the transposable elements Tn5, Tn501 or mini Mu were readily transferred from Escherichia coli donors into Zymomonas mobilis recipients with frequencies depending both on donor and recipient strain used. With the exception of pULB113 (RP4::mini Mu), all foreign plasmids exhibited high instability in Z. mobilis transconjugants under both selective and non-selective conditions. Transposition events and consequent mutagenesis occurred readily in Z. mobilis transconjugant strains, with Tn5 and Tn501 being far less successful than mini Mu. Transposon mutagenesis with the help of mini Mu resulted in the isolation of a large number of independent auxotrophs with polyauxotrophs, cysteine, methionine and isoleucine requiring-isolates being the most frequent. When chromosomal DNA from all these mutants was digested with various restriction enzymes and the resulting restriction patterns were hybridized with a mini Mu probe, the majority of these mutants appeared to have insertions at different sites of the chromosome. Thus, transposon mutagenesis by mini Mu is proven to be a simple and efficient tool for mutant production and the genetic analysis of Z. mobilis.
TI  - Extracellular melibiose and fructose are intermediates in raffinose catabolism during fermentation to ethanol by engineered enteric bacteria.
AB  - Contrary to general concepts of bacterial saccharide metabolism, melibiose (25 to 32 g/liter) and fructose (5 to 14 g/liter) accumulated as extracellular intermediates during the catabolism of raffinose (O-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-1, 6-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-beta-D-fructofuranoside) (90 g/liter) by ethanologenic recombinants of Escherichia coli B, Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1, and Erwinia chrysanthemi EC16. Both hydrolysis products (melibiose and fructose) were subsequently transported and further metabolized by all three organisms. Raffinose catabolism was initiated by beta-fructosidase; melibiose was subsequently hydrolyzed to galactose and glucose by alpha-galactosidase. Glucose and fructose were completely metabolized by all three organisms, but galactose accumulated in the fermentation broth with EC16(pLOI555) and P2. MM2 (a raffinose-positive E. coli mutant) was the most effective biocatalyst for ethanol production (38 g/liter) from raffinose. All organisms rapidly fermented sucrose (90 g/liter) to ethanol (48 g/liter) at more than 90% of the theoretical yield. During sucrose catabolism, both hydrolysis products (glucose and fructose) were metabolized concurrently by EC16(pLOI555) and P2 without sugar leakage. However, fructose accumulated extracellularly (27 to 28 g/liter) at early stages of fermentation with KO11 and MM2. Sequential utilization of glucose and fructose correlated with a diauxie in base utilization (pH maintenance). The mechanism of sugar escape remains unknown but may involve downhill leakage via permease which transports precursor saccharides or novel sugar export proteins. If sugar escape occurs in nature with wild organisms, it could facilitate the development of complex bacterial communities which are based on the sequence of saccharide catabolism and the hierarchy of sugar utilization.
TI  - Expression of the Zymomonas mobilis gfo gene or NADP-containing glucose:fructose  oxidoreductase (GFOR) in Escherichia coli. Formation of enzymatically active preGFOR but lack of processing into a stable periplasmic protein.
AB  - Glucose:fructose oxidoreductase (GFOR) of the gram-negative bacterium Zymomonas mobilis is a periplasmic enzyme with tightly bound cofactor NADP. The preprotein carries an unusually long N-terminal signal peptide of 52 amino acid residues. Expression of the gfo gene in cells of Escherichia coli K12, under the control of a tac promoter, led to immunologically detectable proteins in western blots, and to the formation of an enzymatically active precursor form (preGFOR), located in the cytosol. Processing of preGFOR to the mature form was not observed in E. coli. Replacement of the authentic GFOR signal peptide by the shorter signal peptides of PhoA or OmpA from E. coli led to processing of the respective GFOR precursor proteins. However, the processed proteins were unstable and rapidly degraded in the periplasm unless an E. coli mutant was used that carried a triple lesion for periplasmic and outer-membrane proteases. When fusion-protein export was inhibited by sodium azide or carboxylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, the cytoplasmic precursor forms of the respective preGFOR were not degraded. A major protease-resistant GFOR peptide from the OmpA-GFOR fusion was found within spheroplasts of E. coli to which NADP had been added externally. The formation of this peptide did not occur in the presence of NAD. It is concluded that NADP is required for GFOR to fold into its native conformation and that its absence from the E. coli periplasm is responsible for failure to form a stable periplasmic protein. The results strongly suggest that, in Z. mobilis, additional protein factors are required for the transport of NADP across the plasma membrane and/or incorporation of NADP into the GFOR apoenzyme.
TI  - Metabolic engineering for the production of carotenoids in non-carotenogenic bacteria and yeasts.
AB  - The crt gene clusters responsible for the biosynthesis of carotenoids such as lycopene, beta-carotene and astaxanthin have been isolated from carotenogenic bacteria such as Erwinia species and the marine bacterium Agrobacterium aurantiacum. The functions of the individual genes have been identified. The first substrate of the enzymes encoded by the Erwinia crt clusters is farnesyl pyrophosphate which is not only the precursor for carotenoid biosynthesis but also sterols, dolichols and other numerous isoprenoid compounds. Escherichia coli does not naturally synthesize carotenoids, but by using the carotenogenic genes recombinant strains accumulating lycopene, beta-carotene and astaxanthin have been produced. Other non-carotenogenic bacteria such as Zymomonas mobilis have also been engineered to produce beta-carotene by the introduction of the corresponding crt genes. A gene capable of enhancing carotenoid levels in E. coli has also been isolated from cDNA libraries of the yeast Phaffia rhodozyma and the green alga Haematococcus pluvialis. This gene has been found to encode an isopentenyl pyrophophate isomerase. It has further been shown that the edible yeasts Candida utilis as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which possess no carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, acquire the ability to produce carotenoids, when the carotenogenic genes are expressed under the control of yeast-derived promoters and terminators. It has been observed in the yeasts S. cerevisiae and C. utilis carrying the lycopene biosynthesis genes that ergosterol content is decreased by 10 and 35%, respectively. It is therefore likely that the carbon flux for the ergosterol biosynthesis has been partially directed from farnesyl pyrophosphate to a new pathway for the lycopene biosynthesis. Further, the expression of a truncated gene which codes for the catalytic domain of the endogenous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase, has been found to be effective for enhancing carotenoid levels in the yeast C. utilis.

TI  - Cysteine 265 is in the active site of, but is not essential for catalysis by tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) from Escherichia coli.
AB  - Site-directed mutagenesis and X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have previously shown that the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) from Escherichia coli is a zinc metalloprotein and identified the enzymic ligands to the zinc [Chong et al. (1995), Biochemistry 34, 3694-3701; Garcia et al. (1966), Biochemistry 35, 3133-3139]. During these studies one mutant, TGT (C265A), was found to exhibit a significantly lower specific activity, but was not found to be involved in the zinc site. The present report demonstrates that TGT is inactivated by treatment with thiol reagents (e.g., DTNB, MMTS, and N-ethylmaleimide). Further, this inactivation is shown to be due to modification of cysteine 265. The kinetic parameters for the mutants TGT (C265A) and TGT (C265S), however, suggest that this residue is not performing a critical role in the TGT reaction. We conclude that cysteine 265 is in the active site of TGT, but is not performing a critical catalytic function. This conclusion is supported by the recent determination of the X-ray crystal structure of the TGT from Zymomonas mobilis [Romier et al. (1966), EMBO J. 15, 2850-2857], which reveals that the residue corresponding to cysteine 265 is distant from the putative catalytic site, but is in the middle of a region of the enzyme surface proposed to bind tRNA.
TI  - Stabilization of pet operon plasmids and ethanol production in Escherichia coli strains lacking lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate-lyase activities.
AB  - In the last decade, a major goal of research in biofuels has been to metabolically engineer microorganisms to ferment multiple sugars from biomass or agricultural wastes to fuel ethanol. Escherichia coli strains genetically engineered to contain the pet operon (Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase B genes) produce high levels of ethanol. Strains carrying the pet operon in plasmid (e.g., E. coli B/pLOI297) or in chromosomal (e.g., E. coli KO11) sites require antibiotics in the media to maintain genetic stability and high ethanol productivity. To overcome this requirement, we used the conditionally lethal E. coli strain FMJ39, which carries mutations for lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase and grows aerobically but is incapable of anaerobic growth unless these mutations are complemented. E. coli FBR1 and FBR2 were created by transforming E. coli FMJ39 with the pet operon plasmids pLOI295 and pLOI297, respectively. Both strains were capable of anaerobic growth and displayed no apparent pet plasmid losses after 60 generations in serially transferred (nine times) anaerobic batch cultures. In contrast, similar aerobic cultures rapidly lost plasmids. In high-cell-density batch fermentations, 3.8% (wt/vol) ethanol (strain FBR1) and 4.4% (wt/vol) ethanol (strain FBR2) were made from 10% glucose. Anaerobic, glucose-limited continuous cultures of strain FBR2 grown for 20 days (51 generations; 23 with tetracycline and then 28 after tetracycline removal) showed no loss of antibiotic resistance. Anaerobic, serially transferred batch cultures and high-density fermentations were inoculated with cells taken at 57 generations from the previous continuous culture. Both cultures continued to produce high levels of ethanol in the absence of tetracycline. The genetic stability conferred by selective pressure for pet-containing cells without requirement for antibiotics suggests potential commercial suitability for E. coli FBR1 and FBR2.
TI  - Development of an arabinose-fermenting Zymomonas mobilis strain by metabolic pathway engineering.
AB  - The substrate fermentation range of the ethanologenic bacterium Zymomonas mobilis was expanded to include the pentose sugar, L-arabinose, which is commonly found in agricultural residues and other lignocellulosic biomass. Five genes, encoding L-arabinose isomerase (araA), L-ribulokinase (araB), L-ribulose-5-phosphate-4-epimerase (araD), transaldolase (talB), and transketolase (tktA), were isolated from Escherichia coli and introduced into Z. mobilis under the control of constitutive promoters that permitted their expression even in the presence of glucose. The engineered strain grew on and produced ethanol from L-arabinose as a sole C source at 98% of the maximum theoretical ethanol yield, based on the amount of consumed sugar. This indicates that arabinose was metabolized almost exclusively to ethanol as the sole fermentation product, with little by-product formation. Although no diauxic growth pattern was evident, the microorganism preferentially utilized glucose before arabinose, apparently reflecting the specificity of the indigenous facilitated diffusion transport system. This microorganism may be useful, along with the previously developed xylose-fermenting Z. mobilis (M. Zhang, C. Eddy, K. Deanda, M. Finkelstein, and S. Picataggio, Science 267:240-243, 1995), in a mixed culture for efficient fermentation of the predominant hexose and pentose sugars in agricultural residues and other lignocellulosic feedstocks to ethanol.
TI  - Expression of the Escherichia coli pmi gene, encoding phosphomannose-isomerase in Zymomonas mobilis, leads to utilization of mannose as a novel growth substrate, which can be used as a selective marker.
AB  - Wild-type Zymomonas mobilis can utilize only three substrates (sucrose, glucose,  and fructose) as sole carbon sources, which are largely converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Here, we show that although D-mannose is not used as a growth substrate, it is taken up via the glucose uniport system (glucose facilitator protein) with a Vmax similar to that of glucose. Moreover, D-mannose was phosphorylated by a side activity of the resident fructokinase to mannose-6-phosphate. Fructokinase was purified to homogeneity from an frk-recombinant Z. mobilis strain showing a specific activity of 205 +/- 25 U of protein mg-1 with fructose (K(m), 0.75 +/- 0.06 mM) and 17 +/- 2 U mg-1 (relative activity, 8.5%) with mannose (K(m), 0.65 +/- 0.08 mM). However, no phosphomannoseisomerase activity could be detected for Z. mobilis, and this appeared to be the reason for the lack of growth on mannose. Therefore, we introduced the Escherichia coli gene pmi (manA) in Z. mobilis under the control of a lacIq-Ptac system on a broad-host-range plasmid (pZY507; Cmr). Subsequently, in pmi-recombinant cells of Z. mobilis, phosphomannoseisomerase was expressed in a range of from 3 U (without isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside [IPTG]) to 20 U mg-1 of protein in crude extracts (after IPTG induction). Recombinant cells of different Z. mobilis strains utilized mannose (4%) as the sole carbon source with a growth rate of 0.07 h-1, provided that they contained fructokinase activity. When the frk gene was additionally expressed from the same vector, fructokinase activities of as much as 9.7 U mg-1 and growth rates of as much as 0.25 h-1 were detected, compared with 0.34 h-1 on fructose for wild-type Z. mobilis. Selection for growth on mannose was used to monitor plasmid transfer of pZY507pmi from E. coli to Z. mobilis strains and could replace the previous selection for antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Identification and characterization of phoN-Sf, a gene on the large plasmid of Shigella flexneri 2a encoding a nonspecific phosphatase.
AB  - A gene encoding a nonspecific phosphatase, named PhoN-Sf, was identified on the large virulence plasmid (pMYSH6000) of Shigella flexneri 2a YSH6000. The phosphatase activity in YSH6000 was observed under high-phosphate conditions. However, it was found that low-phosphate conditions induced a slightly higher level of activity. The nucleotide sequence of the phoN-Sf region cloned from pMYSH6000 possessing the phoN-Sf gene encoded 249 amino acids with a typical signal sequence at the N terminus. The deduced amino acid sequence of the PhoN-Sf protein revealed significant homology to sequences of nonspecific acid phosphatases of other bacteria, such as Providencia stuartii (PhoN, 83.2%), Morganella morganii (PhoC, 80.6%), Salmonella typhimurium (PhoN, 47.8%), and Zymomonas mobilis (PhoC, 34.8%). The PhoN-Sf protein was purified, and its biochemical properties were characterized. The apparent molecular mass of the protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was calculated to be 27 kDa. The 20 amino acids at the N terminus corresponded to the 20 amino acid residues following the putative signal sequence of PhoN-Sf protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The PhoN-Sf activity had a pH optimum of 6.6, and the optimum temperature was 37 degrees C. The enzymatic activity was inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate, N-bromosuccinimide, or dithiothreitol but not by EDTA. The subcellular localization of the PhoN-Sf protein in YSH6000 revealed that the protein was found predominantly in the periplasm. Examination of Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli strains for PhoN-Sf production by immunoblotting with the PhoN-specific antibody and for the presence of phoN-Sf DNA by using a phoN-Sf probe indicated that approximately one-half of the strains possessed the phoN-Sf gene on the large plasmid and expressed the PhoN-Sf protein. The Tn5 insertion mutants of YSH6000 possessing phoN-Sf::Tn5 still retained wild-type levels of invasiveness, as well as the subsequent spreading capacity in MK2 epithelial cell monolayers, thus suggesting that the PhoN-Sf activity is not involved in expression of the virulence phenotypes of Shigella strains under in vitro conditions.
TI  - Overexpression, purification, and generation of a thermostable variant of Zymomonas mobilis fructokinase.
AB  - The gene encoding fructokinase (EC 2.7.1.4) from Zymomonas mobilis has been expressed at high level in Escherichia coli by modifying the ribosome binding site using the polymerase chain reaction. A simple two-step purification from extracts of the recombinant cells results in highly purified enzyme suitable for use in fructose determination. Using the polymerase chain reaction in mutagenic conditions, a variant of fructokinase was isolated which was more thermostable than the wild type, taking the 30 min half-life from 70.1 to 72.4 degrees C. The purified thermostable variant had the same specific activity as the wild type. Sequencing of the variant indicated that only one amino acid was changed, with Ser 69 becoming Ala. Searches of the mutant libraries for variants that were (a) active with glucose or (b) had reduced inhibition by glucose were unsuccessful.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the levansucrase gene from the endophytic sugarcane bacterium Acetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4.
AB  - The Acetobacter diazotrophicus SRT4 gene encoding levansucrase (EC 2.4.1.10) (IsdA) was isolated from a genomic library. The nucleotide sequence of a 2.3 kb DNA fragment sufficient for complementation of a levansucrase-deficient mutant (obtained by EMS treatment) was determined. The IsdA gene (1751 bp) coded for a polypeptide of molecular mass 64.9 kDa with an isoelectric point of 5.2. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the extracellular levansucrase indicated the presence of a precursor protein with a putative signal sequence of 51 residues which is possibly cleaved in two successive steps. Expression of the IsdA gene from the lac promoter in Escherichia coli resulted in the production of a protein with levansucrase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence of the IsdA gene was 48% and 46% identical with the levansucrases from the Gram-negative bacteria Zymomonas mobilis and Erwinia amylovora, respectively, but only 28-31% identical with levansucrases from Gram-positive bacteria. Multiple alignments of published levansucrase sequences from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed eight conserved motifs. A comparison of the catalytic properties and the sequence of the A. diazotrophicus levansucrase with those of the Bacillus subtilis levansucrase suggested that one of these motifs may be involved in the specificity of the synthetized product. Disruption of the IsdA gene in the genome of A. diazotrophicus resulted in a mutant lacking both levansucrase activity and the ability to utilize sucrose as a carbon source, suggesting that levansucrase is the key enzyme in sucrose metabolism of A. diazotrophicus.
TI  - The gluEMP operon from Zymomonas mobilis encodes a high-affinity glutamate carrier with similarity to binding-protein-dependent transport systems.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence downstream of the grp gene, encoding the glutamate uptake regulatory protein of Zymomonas mobilis, was determined. Three clustered genes (gluE, gluM, and gluP) close to ghe grp gene, but on the opposite strand, were identified. These genes encode a high-affinity transport system for glutamate and aspartate. The gluP gene product is a polypeptide of 25.4 kDa and contains segments with significant similarity to the ATP-binding proteins of binding-protein-dependent transport systems. The GluM polypeptide (22.9 kDa) is highly hydrophobic and consists of four potential membrane-spanning domains. The hydrophilic gluE gene product, with a molecular mass of 22.1 kDa, contains a region with sequence similarity to some of the periplasmic binding proteins and a sequence motif of a signal peptide for periplasmic localization. The transport system could not be functionally expressed in Z. mobilis. However, when heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, it catalyzed uptake of glutamate, which was characterized kinetically. Our results suggest that the glutamate transport system encoded by the gluEMP operon is repressed in Z. mobilis by the regulatory protein Grp.
TI  - The role of residues glutamate-50 and phenylalanine-496 in Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase.
AB  - Several enzymes require thiamine diphosphate (ThDP) as an essential cofactor, and we have used one of these, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC; EC 4.1.1.1) from Zymomonas mobilis, as a model for this group of enzymes. It is well suited for this purpose because of its stability, ease of purification, homotetrameric subunit structure and simple kinetic properties. Crystallographic analyses of three ThDP-dependent enzymes [Muller, Lindqvist, Furey, Schulz, Jordan and Schneider (1993) Structure 1, 95-103] have suggested that an invariant glutamate participates in catalysis. In order to evaluate the role of this residue, identified in PDC from Zymomonas mobilis as Glu-50, it has been altered to glutamine and aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned gene. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Here we demonstrate that substitution with aspartate yields an enzyme with 3% of the activity of the wild-type, but with normal kinetics for pyruvate. Replacement of Glu-50 with glutamine yields an enzyme with only 0.5% of the catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme. Each of these mutant enzymes has a decreased affinity for both ThDP and Mg2+. It has been reported that the binding of cofactors to apoPDC quenches the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence [Diefenbach and Duggleby (1991) Biochem. J. 276, 439-445] and we have identified the residue responsible as Trp-487 [Diefenbach, Candy, Mattick and Duggleby (1992) FEBS Lett. 296, 95-98]. Although this residue is some distance from the cofactor binding site, it lies in the dimer interface, and the proposal has been put forward [Dyda, Furey, Swaminathan, Sax, Farrenkopf and Jordan (1993) Biochemistry 32, 6165-6170] that alteration of ring stacking with Phe-496 of the adjacent subunit is the mechanism of fluorescence quenching when cofactors bind. The closely related enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase (from Enterobacter cloacae) has a leucine residue at the position corresponding to Phe-496 but shows fluorescence quenching properties that are similar to those of PDC. This suggests that the fluorescence quenching is due to some perturbation of the local environment of Trp-487 rather than to a specific interaction with Phe-496. This latter hypothesis is supported by our data: mutation of this phenylalanine to leucine, isoleucine or histidine in PDC does not eliminate the fluorescence quenching upon addition of cofactors.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the unique Ca2+-ATPase from Flavobacterium odoratum.
AB  - The 60-kDa Ca2+-ATPase from Flavobacterium odoratum is kinetically and mechanistically similar to other P-type ATPases, suggesting its use as a model system for structure-function studies of ion transport. A portion of the gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA with degenerate oligonucleotide primers, one based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein and the other based on a consensus sequence for the phosphorylation site of P-type ATPases. This gene fragment was used to screen a lambda library of F. odoratum 29979 DNA. Clone "C" is 3.3 kilobases in length and contains one complete and part of a second open reading frame, the first of which encodes a 58-kDa protein containing the exact N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified protein. We have named this gene cda, for calcium-dependent ATPase. Escherichia coli, transformed with clone C, demonstrates high levels of calcium-dependent and vanadate-sensitive ATP hydrolysis activity, forms a 60-kDa phosphointermediate, and cross-reacts with antibodies to the purified Ca2+-ATPase. The gene has almost no sequence homology to even the highly conserved regions characteristic of P-type ATPases but does possess significant homology to a protein with alkaline phosphatase activity (PhoD) from Zymomonas mobilis. The putative phosphorylation site is a Walker A (P-loop) ATP binding sequence and is modified relative to P-type ATPases, suggesting that the F. odoratum Ca2+-ATPase may represent an ancestral link between the F- and the P-type ATPases or perhaps a new class of ATPases.
TI  - Factors contributing to the loss of ethanologenicity of Escherichia coli B recombinants pL0I297 and KO11.
AB  - To be economic and to be compatible with modern continuous bioconversion systems, it is imperative that the process organism exhibits an extremely high degree of stability. In the case of ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass, functional stability of the potential process biocatalyst can be assessed in terms of the capacity to sustain high-performance fermentation during the continuous fermentation of biomass-derived sugars. This investigation employed glucose- or xylose-limited chemostat culture to examine the functional stability of two patented, genetically engineered E. coli-namely E. coli B (ATCC 11303) carrying the Zymomonas genes for pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II on a multicopy plasmid pLOI297 and a chromosomal pet integrant of strain 11303, designated as strain KO11. Both recombinants carry markers for antibiotic resistance and have been reported to exhibit genetic stability in the absence of antibiotic selection. Chemostats were fed with Luria broth (LB) (with 25 g/L sugar) at a dilution rate of 0.14 and 0.07/h when the feed medium was glucose-LB and xylose-LB, respectively. They pH was controlled at 6.3. With glucose, both recombinants exhibited a rapid loss of ethanologenicity even when selection pressure was imposed by the inclusion of antibiotics in the feed medium. With strain KO11, increasing the concentration of chloramphenicol from 40 to 300 mg/L, resulted in a retardation in the rate of loss of ethanologenicity, but it did not prevent it. Under xylose limitation, the plasmid-bearing recombinant appeared to be stabilized by antibiotics, but this did not reflect genetic stability, since the slower-growing revertant was washed out at a dilution rate of 0.07/h. With both recombinants, interpretation of functional stability with xylose was complicated by the inherent ethanologenicity associated with the host culture. Based on an average cost for large bulk quantities of antibiotics at $55/kg and an amendment level of 40 g/m3, the estimated economic impact regarding the potential requirement for operational stabilization by antibiotics in a plant operating in batch mode varied from a maximum of 29 cents/gal of E95 ethanol for antibiotic amendment of all fermentation media to a minimum of 0.45 cents/gal where antibiotics were used exclusively for the preparation of the inocula for every fourth batch fermentation cycle. The high degree of instability observed in these continuous fermentations does not auger well for the proposed potential industrial utility of these patented, genetically engineered constructs for the production of fuel ethanol from biomass and wastes.
TI  - The relationship between growth enhancement and pet expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The pet operon consists of genes coding for enzymes responsible for ethanol production and consists of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase II from the high-performance ethanologen Zymomonas mobilis. This article describes the physiological influence of pet expression in Escherichia coli B (ATCC 11303) in terms of growth rate and overall concentrations of cell mass and catabolic end products achieved under well-defined cultivation conditions that included constant pH and carbon (energy) limitation. Glucose, mannose, and xylose were used as substrates, because they represent the principal fermentable components of lignocellulosic biomass and because fermentation of these sugars involves different metabolic pathways. Two different types of ethanologenic recombinants were used-a strain in which pet expression was via a multicopy plasmid (pLO1297) and a chromosomal integrant, strain KO11. Under the condition of sugar substrate limitation, there was no growth enhancement by pet expression with either glucose or mannose. Whereas the host strain produced exclusively lactic acid from glucose and mannose, both recombinants produced mostly ethanol. Both the plasmid-carrying strain and the pet integrant exhibited slower growth compared to the host culture with glucose or mannose as fermentation substrate. With mannose, the plasmid recombinant grew appreciably slower than either the host culture or the recombinant KO11. Use of a magnesium-deficient medium produced different results with glucose since substrate and turbidometric measurements proved to be unreliable in terms of estimating overall biomass levels. At pH 6.3, pet expression improved overall biomass yield; but at pH 7.0, the cell yields exhibited by the plasmid recombinant and the host strain were the same. E. coli B did not grow well on xylose as sole carbon source. With xylose, pet expression increased the growth rate, but had no effect on the overall biomass yield. In comparing our observations with the reports of others, it was concluded that the effect of pet expression on growth of E.coli is dependent on several different biochemical, physiological, genetic, and environmental factors, which largely precludes a statement of generality regarding this phenomenon.
TI  - The cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 contains a second alkaline phosphatase encoded by phoV.
AB  - A gene (phoV) encoding an alkaline phosphatase from Synechococcus sp. strain PCC  7942 was isolated by screening a plasmid gene bank for expression of alkaline phosphatase activity in Escherichia coli JM103. Two independent clones carrying the same alkaline-phosphatase-encoding gene were isolated. One of these clones (pKW1) was further analysed and the nucleotide sequence of a contiguous 3234 bp DNA fragment was determined. Two complete open reading frames (ORF1 and phoV) and an incomplete ORF3 were identified reading in the same direction. The deduced phoV gene product showed 34% identity to the alkaline phosphatase PhoA from Zymomonas mobilis, and the N-terminal part of the putative ORF3 protein exhibited 57% identity to a protein of unknown function from Frankia sp. Insertional inactivation of the Synechococcus PCC 7942 phoV gene failed, indicating an essential role for either the phoV or the ORF3 gene product. PhoV consists of 550 amino acid residues, resulting in a molecular mass of 61.3 kDa. To overexpress the Synechococcus PCC 7942 phoV gene in E. coli, plasmid pKW1 was transformed into a phoA mutant of E. coli (CC118). In E. coli strain CC118(pKW1) PhoV was expressed constitutively with high rates of activity, and was shown to be membrane associated in the periplasmic space. After partial purification of the recombinant PhoV, it was shown that, like other alkaline phosphatases, the Synechococcus PhoV had a broad pH optimum in the alkaline region and a broad substrate specificity for phosphomonoesters, required Zn2+ for activity, and was inhibited by phosphate. In contrast to several other alkaline phosphatases, PhoV was inhibited by Mn2+. Due to the lack of a Synechococcus PCC 7942 phoV mutant strain, the function of PhoV remains uncertain. However, the present results show that Synechococcus PCC 7942 has a second, probably phosphate-irrepressible, alkaline phosphatase (PhoV, 61.3 kDa) in addition to the phosphate-repressible enzyme (PhoA, 145 kDa) already described.
TI  - Isolation and sequence analysis of rpoH genes encoding sigma 32 homologs from gram negative bacteria: conserved mRNA and protein segments for heat shock regulation.
AB  - The rpoH genes encoding homologs of Escherichia coli sigma 32 (heat shock sigma factor) were isolated and sequenced from five gram negative proteobacteria (gamma or alpha subgroup): Enterobacter cloacae (gamma), Serratia marcescens (gamma), Proteus mirabilis (gamma), Agrobacterium tumefaciens (alpha) and Zymomonas mobilis (alpha). Comparison of these and three known genes from E.coli (gamma), Citrobacter freundii (gamma) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (gamma) revealed marked similarities that should reflect conserved function and regulation of sigma 32 in the heat shock response. Both the sequence complementary to part of 16S rRNA (the 'downstream box') and a predicted mRNA secondary structure similar to those involved in translational control of sigma 32 in E.coli were found for the rpoH genes from the gamma, but not the alpha, subgroup, despite considerable divergence in nucleotide sequence. Moreover, a stretch of nine amino acid residues Q(R/K)(K/R)LFFNLR, designated the 'RpoH box', was absolutely conserved among all sigma 32 homologs, but absent in other sigma factors; this sequence overlapped with the segment of polypeptide thought to be involved in DnaK/DnaJ chaperone-mediated negative control of synthesis and stability of sigma 32. In addition, a putative sigma E (sigma 24)-specific promoter was found in front of all rpoH genes from the gamma, but not alpha, subgroup. These results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms, as well as the function, of the heat shock response known in E.coli are very well conserved among the gamma subgroup and partially conserved among the alpha proteobacteria.
TI  - Overexpression of extracellular sucrase (SacC) of Zymomonas mobilis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The extracellular sucrase (SacC) gene of Zymomonas mobilis was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 using the T7 polymerase expression system. A low cell density induction method was designed to have maximum expression, and the conditions (IPTG concentration, ampicillin addition) were optimised to overexpress to the level of more than 60% of the total cellular protein representing SacC protein.
TI  - Development of a gene reporter system in moderately halophilic bacteria by employing the ice nucleation gene of Pseudomonas syringae.
AB  - The expression of the ice nucleation gene inaZ of Pseudomonas syringae in several moderate halophiles was investigated to establish its utility as a reporter for promoter activity and gene expression studies in these biotechnologically and environmentally important bacteria. A promoterless version of inaZ was introduced in two different restriction sites and at both orientations in a recombinant plasmid able to replicate in moderate halophiles and, in particular, within the sequence of its pHE1 part, a native plasmid of Halomonas elongata. One orientation of both recombinant constructs expressed high levels of ice nucleation activity in H. elongata and Volcaniella eurihalina cells, indicating that inaZ was probably introduced in the correct orientation downstream of putative native promoters. A recombinant construct carrying a tandem duplication of inaZ at the same orientation gave significantly higher ice nucleation activity, showing that inaZ is appropriate for gene dosage studies. The ice nucleation gene was also expressed in H. elongata and V. eurihalina under the control of Pbla (the promoter of the beta-lactamase gene of Escherichia coli) and Ppdc (the promoter of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene of Zymomonas mobilis). One of the inaZ reporter plasmids expressing high levels of ice nucleation activity under the control of a native putative promoter was also transferred in Halomonas subglaciescola, Halomonas meridiana, Halomonas halodurans, and Deleya halophila. In all cases, Ice+ transconjugants were successfully isolated, demonstrating that inaZ is expressed in a wide spectrum of moderately halophilic species.
TI  - Construction of an integrative shuttle vector for Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - An integrative shuttle vector, pZMOCP1, was constructed by ligating EcoRV digests of the plasmid cloning vector pBluescript and pZMP1, a cryptic plasmid of Zymomonas mobilis PROIMI A1. The 7.2-kb plasmid pZMOCP1 replicated in Escherichia coli and could also be transferred from this host by electroporation to Z. mobilis ATCC 29191. The transformants were selected by ampicillin resistance. The integrative characteristic was detected by hybridization in situ. The vector was stably maintained in Z. mobilis after 200 generations without selective pressure.
TI  - Sequence analysis and overexpression of the Zymomonas mobilis tgt gene encoding tRNA-guanine transglycosylase: purification and biochemical characterization of the enzyme.
AB  - tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) is involved in the biosynthesis of the hypermodified tRNA nucleoside queuosine (Q). It catalyzes the posttranscriptional base exchange of the Q precursor 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1) with the genetically encoded guanine in the anticodon of tRNA(Asp), tRNA(Asn), tRNA(His), and tRNA(Tyr). A partially sequenced gene upstream of the DNA ligase (lig) gene of the Zymomonas mobilis chromosome shows strong homology to the tgt gene of Escherichia coli (K.B. Shark and T. Conway, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 96:19-26, 1992). We showed that this gene is able to complement the tgt mutation in E. coli SJ1505, and we determined its complete sequence. Four start codons were possible for this gene, resulting in proteins of 386 to 399 amino acids (M(r), 42,800 to 44,300) showing 60.4% sequence identity with Tgt from E. coli. The smallest of the four possible reading frames, which was still extended at its 5' end compared with the E. coli tgt gene, was overexpressed in E. coli. The gene product was purified to homogeneity and was biochemically characterized. The kinetical parameters were virtually identical to those published for the E. coli enzyme. In contrast to E. coli Tgt, which is reported to be a homotrimer, Z. mobilis Tgt was found to be a monomer according to gel filtration. In this study, it was shown that the formation of homotrimers by the E. coli enzyme is readily reversible and is dependent on protein concentration.
TI  - The glutamate uptake regulatory protein (Grp) of Zymomonas mobilis and its relation to the global regulator Lrp of Escherichia coli.
AB  - After being expressed in Escherichia coli JC5412, which is defective in glutamate transport, a Zymomonas mobilis gene which enabled this strain to grow on glutamate was cloned. This gene encodes a protein with 33% amino acid identity to the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) of E. coli. Although overall glutamate uptake in E. coli was increased, the protein encoded by the cloned fragment repressed the secondary H+/glutamate transport system GltP by interaction with the promoter region of the gltP gene. It also repressed the secondary, H(+)-coupled glutamate uptake system of Z. mobilis, indicating that at least one role of this protein in Z. mobilis is to regulate glutamate transport. Consequently, it was designated Grp (for glutamate uptake regulatory protein). When expressed in E. coli, Grp repressed the secondary H+/glutamate transport system GltP by binding to the regulatory regions of the gltP gene. An lrp mutation in E. coli was complemented in trans with respect to the positive expression regulation of ilvIH (coding for acetohydroxy acid synthase III) by a plasmid which carries the grp gene. The expression of grp is autoregulated, and in Z. mobilis, it depends on growth conditions. The putative presence of a homolog of Grp in E. coli is discussed.
TI  - Functional expression of the glucose transporter of Zymomonas mobilis leads to restoration of glucose and fructose uptake in Escherichia coli mutants and provides evidence for its facilitator action.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding the glucose facilitator (glf), glucokinase (glk), or fructokinase (frk) were cloned and expressed in a lacIq-Ptac system using Escherichia coli K-12 mutants deficient in uptake and phosphorylation of glucose and fructose. Growth on glucose or fructose was restored when the respective genes (glf-glk or glf-frk) were expressed. In E. coli glf+ strains, both glucose and fructose were taken up via facilitated diffusion (Km, 4.1 mM for glucose and 39 mM for fructose; Vmax at 15 degrees C, 75 and 93 nmol min-1 mg-1 [dry weight] for glucose and fructose, respectively). For both substrates, counterflow maxima were observed.
TI  - Improved strains of recombinant Escherichia coli for ethanol production from sugar mixtures.
AB  - Hemicellulose hydrolysates of agricultural residues often contain mixtures of hexose and pentose sugars. Ethanologenic Escherichia coli that have been previously investigated preferentially ferment hexose sugars. In some cases, xylose fermentation was slow or incomplete. The purpose of this study was to develop improved ethanologenic E. coli strains for the fermentation of pentoses in sugar mixtures. Using fosfomycin as a selective agent, glucose-negative mutants of E. coli KO11 (containing chromosomally integrated genes encoding the ethanol pathway from Zymomonas mobilis) were isolated that were unable to ferment sugars transported by the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. These strains (SL31 and SL142) retained the ability to ferment sugars with independent transport systems such as arabinose and xylose and were used to ferment pentose sugars to ethanol selectively in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. Additional fosfomycin-resistant mutants were isolated that were superior to strain KO11 for ethanol production from hexose and pentose sugars. These hyperproductive strains (SL28 and SL40) retained the ability to metabolize all sugars tested, completed fermentations more rapidly, and achieved higher ethanol yields than the parent. Both SL28 and SL40 produced 60 gl-1 ethanol from 120 gl-1 xylose in 60 h, 20% more ethanol than KO11 under identical conditions. Further studies illustrated the feasibility of sequential fermentation. A mixture of hexose and pentose sugars was fermented with near theoretical yield by SL40 in the first step followed by a second fermentation in which yeast and glucose were added. Such a two-step approach can combine the attributes of ethanologenic E. coli for pentoses with the high ethanol tolerance of conventional yeasts in a single vessel.
TI  - Imidazole acetol phosphate aminotransferase in Zymomonas mobilis: molecular genetic, biochemical, and evolutionary analyses.
AB  - hisH encodes imidazole acetol phosphate (IAP) aminotransferase in Zymomonas mobilis and is located immediately upstream of tyrC, a gene which codes for cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. A plasmid containing hisH was able to complement an Escherichia coli histidine auxotroph which lacked the homologous aminotransferase. DNA sequencing of hisH revealed an open reading frame of 1,110 bp, encoding a protein of 40,631 Da. The cloned hisH product was purified from E. coli and estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to have a molecular mass of 40,000 Da. Since the native enzyme had a molecular mass of 85,000 Da as determined by gel filtration, the active enzyme species must be a homodimer. The purified enzyme was able to transaminate aromatic amino acids and histidine in addition to histidinol phosphate. The existence of a single protein having broad substrate specificity was consistent with the constant ratio of activities obtained with different substrates following a variety of physical treatments (such as freeze-thaw, temperature inactivation, and manipulation of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate content). The purified enzyme did not require addition of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, but dependence upon this cofactor was demonstrated following resolution of the enzyme and cofactor by hydroxylamine treatment. Kinetic data showed the classic ping-pong mechanism expected for aminotransferases. Km values of 0.17, 3.39, and 43.48 mM for histidinol phosphate, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were obtained. The gene structure around hisH-tyrC suggested an operon organization. The hisH-tyrC cluster in Z. mobilis is reminiscent of the hisH-tyrA component of a complex operon in Bacillus subtilis, which includes the tryptophan operon and aroE. Multiple alignment of all aminotransferase sequences available in the database showed that within the class I superfamily of aminotransferases, IAP aminotransferases (family I beta) are closer to the I gamma family (e.g., rat tyrosine aminotransferase) than to the I alpha family (e.g., rat aspartate aminotransferase or E. coli AspC). Signature motifs which distinguish the IAP aminotransferase family were identified in the region of the active-site lysine and in the region of the interdomain interface.
TI  - Molecular cloning and characterization of the extracellular sucrase gene (sacC) of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis gene sacC that encodes the extracellular sucrase (protein B46) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene was found to be present downstream to the already described levansucrase gene sacB in the cloned chromosomal fragment of Z. mobilis. The expression product was different from SacB and exhibited sucrase but not levansucrase activity; therefore, SacC behaves like a true sucrase. Expression of sacC in E. coli JM109 and XL1 was very low; overexpression was observed in E. coli BL21 after induction of the T7 polymerase expression system with IPTG. Subcellular fractionation of the E. coli clone carrying plasmid pLSS2811 showed that more than 70% of the sucrase activity could be detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that the enzyme was soluble and not secreted in E. coli. The nucleotide sequence analysis of sacC revealed an open reading frame 1239bp long coding for a 413 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 46 kDa. The first 30 deduced amino acids from this ORF were identical with those from the N-terminal sequence of the extracellular sucrase (protein B46) purified from Z. mobilis ZM4. No leader peptide sequence could be identified in the sacC gene. The amino acid sequence of SacC showed very little similarity to those of other known sucrases, but was very similar to the levansucrases of Z. mobilis (61.5%), Erwinia amylovora (40.2%) and Bacillus subtilis (25.6%).
TI  - Characterization of the Zymomonas mobilis glucose facilitator gene product (glf)  in recombinant Escherichia coli: examination of transport mechanism, kinetics and the role of glucokinase in glucose transport.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis is known to transport glucose by a facilitated diffusion process. A putative glucose facilitator gene (glf), closely related to a large family of glucose transporters, is located in a cluster of genes that code for enzymes of glucose metabolism. The Z. mobilis glf gene is able to complement glucose transport in an Escherichia coli strain that is defective in native glucose transport and glucokinase. In this study, the recombinant E. coli was shown to be capable of influx counterflow when preloaded with glucose and had an apparent Km for glucose of approximately 1.1-2.9 mM, consistent with the function of Glf as a low-affinity glucose facilitator. The ability of glucokinase mutants expressing glf to transport glucose made it clear that glucokinase activity was not required for Glf-dependent glucose transport. The possibility that glucokinase can interact with Glf to improve the affinity for glucose was not supported since expression of the Z. mobilis glucokinase gene, in addition to glf, did not affect the Km of Glf for glucose in recombinant E. coli. The inability of various sugars to compete with glucose during glucose transport by recombinant E. coli expressing glf indicated that Glf is specific for glucose. While the results of fructose transport assays did not completely rule out the possibility of very low affinity for fructose, the apparent specificity of Glf for glucose makes it possible that Z. mobilis utilizes a different transporter(s) for fructose.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and characterization of the alkaline phosphatase gene (phoD)  from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The phoD gene encoding the membrane-bound alkaline phosphatase (ALPI) from Zymomonas mobilis CP4 was cloned and sequenced. Both the translated sequence and the properties of the recombinant enzyme were unusual. Z. mobilis ALPI was monomeric (M(r) 62,926) and hydrolysed nucleotides more effectively than sugar phosphates. The translated sequence contained a single hydrophobic segment near the N-terminus which may serve as a membrane-anchor in Z. mobilis, although the recombinant enzyme was recovered in the cytoplasmic fraction of Escherichia coli. The predicted amino acid sequence for ALPI did not align well with other ALPs or other known genes. However, some similarity to E. coli ALP was noted in the metal-binding and phosphate-binding regions. Two other regions were identified with similarity to the active sites of pyruvate kinase and mammalian 5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (also membrane-bound), respectively. It is likely that Z. mobilis phoD represents a new class of alkaline phosphatase genes which has not been described previously.
TI  - The Ice Nucleation Gene from Pseudomonas syringae as a Sensitive Gene Reporter for Promoter Analysis in Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The expression of the ice nucleation gene inaZ from Pseudomonas syringae in Zymomonas mobilis strains under the control of three different promoters was investigated to establish the utility of the gene as a reporter and examine the possible use of the organism as a source of ice nuclei for biotechnological applications. A promoterless version of the inaZ gene was placed under the control of three different promoters: P(infpdc) (pyruvate decarboxylase), a homologous strong promoter from Z. mobilis; P(infbla) ((beta)-lactamase) of plasmid pBR325; and P(infhrpR), the promoter of hrpR, a regulatory gene from P. syringae pv. phaseolicola. The apparent strengths of all three promoters, measured by quantifying the ice nucleation activity at -9 deg C, were lower in Z. mobilis than in Escherichia coli. The levels of ice nucleation activity expressed under the P(infpdc) promoter were significantly higher than those obtained with the two heterologous promoters in Z. mobilis. Plasmid pCG4521 (RK2 replicon) gave much lower levels of ice nucleation activity when propagated in strain uvs-51, a plasmid instability mutant of Z. mobilis, compared with the wild-type strain. The ice nucleation activity in Z. mobilis cultures showed unusual partitioning in that the culture supernatants obtained after low-speed centrifugation contained the majority of ice nuclei. Analysis of the ice nucleation spectra revealed that the cell pellets contained both "warm" and "cold" nuclei, while the culture supernatant contained primarily cold nuclei, suggesting that the cold nucleus activity may be extracellular. However, all nucleation activity was retained by 0.22-(mu)m-pore-size filters.
TI  - Zymomonas mobilis squalene-hopene cyclase gene (shc): cloning, DNA sequence analysis, and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Using a DNA probe from the gene encoding squalene-hopene cyclase (SHC, EC 5.4.99.-) from the Gram-positive bacterium Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius, we have cloned a 4.3 kb HindIII fragment of chromosomal DNA from Zymomonas mobilis. An open reading frame of 1977 bp was detected that could encode a protein of 658 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 74077 Da. Under the control of lac or tac promoters, this gene, shc, was expressed in Escherichia coli K12 strains and its product had squalene-hopene cyclase activity. Sequence alignments with the A. acidocaldarius SHC, the lanosterol cyclase of the yeast Candida albicans, and the cycloartenol synthase of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana revealed six highly conserved regions (mainly in the C-terminal part) of the proteins. These regions contained the core motif Gln-X-X-X-Gly-X-Trp.
TI  - Comparative energetics of glucose and xylose metabolism in ethanologenic recombinant Escherichia coli B.
AB  - This study compared the anaerobic catabolism of glucose and xylose by a patented, recombinant ethanologenic Escherichia coli B 11303:pLOI297 in terms of overall yields of cell mass (growth), energy (ATP), and end product (ethanol). Batch cultivations were conducted with pH-controlled stirred-tank bioreactors using both a nutritionally rich, complex medium (Luria broth) and a defined salts minimal medium and growth-limiting concentrations of glucose or xylose. The value of gamma ATP was determined to be 9.28 and 8.19 g dry wt cells/mol ATP in complex and minimal media, respectively. Assuming that the nongrowth-associated energy demand is similar for glucose and xylose, the mass-based growth yield (Yx/s, g dry wt cells/g sugar) should be proportional to the net energy yield from sugar metabolism. The value of Yx/s was reduced, on average, by about 50% (from 0.096 g/g glu to 0.51 g/g xyl) when xylose replaced glucose as the growth-limiting carbon and energy source. It was concluded that this observation is consistent with the theoretical difference in net energy (ATP) yield associated with anaerobic catabolism of glucose and xylose when differences in the mechanisms of energy-coupled transport of each sugar are taken into account. In a defined salts medium, the net ATP yield was determined to be 2.0 and 0.92 for glucose and xylose, respectively.
TI  - Cloning of the Acetobacter xylinum cellulase gene and its expression in Escherichia coli and Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - A DNA fragment corresponding to carboxymethylcellulase activity of Acetobacter xylinum IFO 3288 was isolated and cloned in Escherichia coli, and the DNA sequence was determined. The DNA fragment sequenced had an open-reading frame of 654 base pairs that encoded a protein of 218 amino acid residues with a deduced molecular mass of 23,996 Da. The protein encoded in the DNA fragment expressed in E. coli hydrolyzed a carboxymethylcellulose. This gene was subcloned into the shuttle vector [pZA22; Misawa et al. (1986) Agric Biol Chem 50:3201-3203] between Zymomonas mobilis and E. coli. The recombinant plasmid pZAAC21 was introduced into Z. mobilis IFO 13756 by electroporation. The carboxymethylcellulase gene was efficiently expressed in both bacteria, although the level of expression in Z. mobilis was ten times greater than that in E. coli. Approximately 75% of the total carboxymethylcellulase activity detected in Z. mobilis was located in the periplasmic space (outside of the cytoplasmic space). Enzyme activity was not detected in the periplasmic space, but in the cytoplasm of E. coli.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of stress genes from the ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis: the groESL operon.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis is unique among bacteria in its ability to produce high levels  of ethanol (EtOH) during fermentation. Elevated EtOH concentration, like elevated temperature, is a microbial stress and a universal inducer of stress proteins. For Z. mobilis, exposure to high levels of EtOH represents a natural stress. By using a simple strategy which combines the genetic tools of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, we have cloned genes encoding two of the most abundant stress proteins in Z. mobilis, GroES and GroEL. Both genes were expressed at high levels in E. coli. Despite the unique environment (EtOH concentrations of above 10%) in which the translated products from these genes function in Z. mobilis, the amino-acid sequences encoded were remarkably similar to their homologues from bacteria which are not known to accumulate EtOH. Two small regions were observed, however, which appear more similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae hsp60 (groEL homologue) than to E. coli or the concensus. These may be related to EtOH tolerance.
TI  - Two genes for carbohydrate catabolism are divergently transcribed from a region of DNA containing the hexC locus in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1.
AB  - The hexC locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was localized to a 247-bp segment of chromosomal DNA on the multicopy broad-host-range vector pRO1614. The presence of this plasmid (pPZ196) in strain PAO1 produced the so-called "hexC effect," a two- to ninefold increase in the activities of four carbohydrate catabolism enzymes, glucokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. The extent of the hexC effect was restricted, since three independently regulated metabolic enzymes were not affected by the presence of the hexC plasmid. Furthermore, the hexC-containing plasmid did not suppress catabolite repression control. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the segment of DNA encompassing hexC revealed a 128-bp region rich in adenosine-plus-thymine (AT) content separating two divergent open reading frames (ORFs). Transcriptional start sites for these two genes were mapped to the intergenic region, demonstrating that this sequence contained overlapping divergent promoters. The intergenic region contained potential regulatory sequences such as dyad symmetry motifs, polydeoxyadenosine tracts, and a sequence matching the integration host factor recognition site in Escherichia coli. One of the ORFs encoded a 610-amino-acid protein with 55 to 60% identity to 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase from E. coli and Zymomonas mobilis. The second ORF coded for a protein of 335 amino acids that displayed 45 to 60% identity to the NAD-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) family of enzymes. The NAD-dependent GAP gene on the P. aeruginosa chromosome was previously unmapped. GAP was found to exhibit the hexC-dependent increase in its basal activity, establishing it as a fifth catabolic enzyme in the multioperonic hex regulon.
TI  - Analysis of the Escherichia coli genome. V. DNA sequence of the region from 76.0  to 81.5 minutes.
AB  - The DNA sequence of a 225.4 kilobase segment of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome  is described here, from 76.0 to 81.5 minutes on the genetic map. This brings the total of contiguous sequence from the E.coli genome project to 725.1 kb (76.0 to 92.8 minutes). We found 191 putative coding genes (ORFs) of which 72 genes were previously known, and 110 of which remain unidentified despite literature and similarity searches. Seven new genes--arsE, arsF, arsG, treF, xylR, xylG, and xylH--were identified as well as the previously mapped pit and dctA genes. The arrangement of proposed genes relative to possible promoters and terminators suggests 90 potential transcription units. Other features include 19 REP elements, 95 computer-predicted bends, 50 Chi sites, and one grey hole. Thirty-one putative signal peptides were found, including those of thirteen known membrane or periplasmic proteins. One tRNA gene (proK) and two insertion sequences (IS5 and IS150) are located in this segment. The genes in this region are organized with equal numbers oriented with or against replication.
TI  - Characterization and sequence of PhoC, the principal phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase of Morganella morganii.
AB  - Phosphatase activities were investigated in Morganella morganii, which is one of  the few enterobacterial species producing high-level phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase activity (HPAP phenotype), and the gene encoding the major phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase was cloned, sequenced, and its product characterized. Using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate, Morganella produced a major phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase (named PhoC) which is associated with the HPAP phenotype, a minor phosphate-irrepressible acid phosphatase, and a phosphate-repressible alkaline phosphatase. The presence of the PhoC activity prevented induction of alkaline phosphatase when a PhoC-hydrolysable organic phosphate ester, such as glycerol 2-phosphate, was the sole phosphate source. PhoC is a secreted nonspecific acid phosphatase apparently composed of four 25 kDa polypeptide subunits. The enzyme is resistant to EDTA, P(i), fluoride and tartrate. The M. morganii PhoC showed 84.6% amino acid sequence identity to the PhoN nonspecific acid phosphatase of Providencia stuartii, 45.3% to the PhoN nonspecific acid phosphatase of Salmonella typhimurium, and 37.8% to the principal acid phosphatase (PhoC) of Zymomonas mobilis. Comparison of sequence data and of regulation of these enzymes suggested a different phylogeny of members of this gene family within the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction-based random mutagenesis: production and characterization of thermostable mutants of Zymomonas mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase-2.
AB  - The adhB gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase-2 from Zymomonas mobilis has been subjected to random mutagenesis to obtain more thermostable variants of the enzyme. Random mutagenesis was accomplished using the polymerase chain reaction in mutagenic conditions. The optimum conditions involved restricting the concentration of one nucleotide to approximately one-tenth the normal amount. This introduced mutations at an average rate of 1 base in 600 in a 30-cycle PCR, sufficient to ensure that the majority of encoding DNA sequences in the mutant library have at least one base change from wild-type. Seven thermostable mutants were isolated from one library screening of 3000 colonies; two of these were selected for detailed study and purified using dye-ligand chromatography. Mutant TS-1 (F9S, V295A) was 3 degrees C more stable than the wild-type and had altered kinetic characteristics, with reduced affinity for ethanol and acetaldehyde and reduced ethanol oxidation Vmax. Mutant TS-2 (M13I, E19K, M192I) also had increased thermostability of 3 to 4 degrees C, but its kinetic characteristics were similar to that of the wild-type. Of the base changes found after sequencing a wide selection of mutants, 90% were transitions and 10% were transversions. Included were several T to C base changes which did not correspond with the nucleotide limitation used to create the mutant libraries.
TI  - Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of an Azospirillum brasilense indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase gene.
AB  - Azospirillum brasilense isolated from the rhizosphere of different plants has the ability to excrete indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) into the culture media. Cosmid p0.2, isolated from an A. brasilense Sp245 genome library in pLAFR1, complements the Tn5-induced mutant SpM7918 of A. brasilense Sp6 which excretes reduced amounts of IAA. Restriction mapping and gene expression studies identified a BglII-EcoRI 4.3 kb fragment of p0.2 sufficient for the restoration of high levels of IAA production in mutant SpM7918. Tn5 mutagenesis localized the gene responsible on a 1.8 kb SmaI fragment. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains one complete open reading frame. The predicted protein sequence shows extensive homology with the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase of Enterobacter cloacae and the pyruvate decarboxylases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis. The A. brasilense mutant Sp245a, constructed by homogenotization of a Tn5 insertion derivative of the 1.8 kb SmaI fragment, also displayed reduced IAA production. Introduction of the cloned wild-type gene into Rhizobium meliloti 1021 resulted in increased IAA production. Cell-free extracts prepared from R. meliloti and A. brasilense transconjugants harboring this gene could convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to indole-3-acetaldehyde and tryptophol. These results clearly demonstrate that IAA production in A. brasilense is mediated by indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase.
TI  - Investigation of the cofactor-binding site of Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - Several enzymes require thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) as an essential cofactor, and  we have used one of these, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC; EC 4.1.1.1) from Zymomonas mobilis, as a model for this group of enzymes. It is well suited for this purpose because of its stability, ease of purification and its simple kinetic properties. A sequence motif of approx. 30 residues, beginning with a glycine-aspartate-glycine (-GDG-) triplet and ending with a double asparagine (-NN-) sequence, has been identified in many of these enzymes [Hawkins, Borges and Perham (1989) FEBS Lett. 255, 77-82]. Other residues within this putative ThDP-binding motif are conserved, but to a lesser extent, including a glutamate and a proline residue. The role of the elements of this motif has been clarified by the determination of the three-dimensional structure of three of these enzymes [Muller, Lindqvist, Furey, Schulz, Jordan and Schneider (1993) Structure 1, 95-103]. Four of the residues within this motif were modified by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned PDC gene to evaluate their role in cofactor binding. The mutant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and found to purify normally, indicating that the tertiary structure of these enzymes had not been grossly perturbed by the amino acid substitutions. We have shown previously [Diefenbach, Candy, Mattick and Duggleby (1992) FEBS Lett. 296, 95-98] that changing the aspartate in the -GDG- sequence to glycine, threonine or asparagine yields an inactive enzyme that is unable to bind ThDP, therefore verifying the role of the ThDP-binding motif. Here we demonstrate that substitution with glutamate yields an active enzyme with a greatly reduced affinity for both ThDP and Mg2+, but with normal kinetics for pyruvate. Unlike the wild-type tetrameric enzyme, this mutant protein usually exists as a dimer. Replacement of the second asparagine of the -NN- sequence by glutamine also yields an inactive enzyme which is unable to bind ThDP, whereas replacement with an aspartate residue results in an active enzyme with a reduced affinity for ThDP but which displays normal kinetics for both Mg2+ and pyruvate. Replacing the conserved glutamate with aspartate did not alter the properties of the enzyme, while the conserved proline, thought to be required for structural reasons, could be substituted with glycine or alanine without inactivating the enzyme, but these changes did reduce its stability.
TI  - Reconstruction of glucose uptake and phosphorylation in a glucose-negative mutant of Escherichia coli by using Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding the glucose facilitator protein and glucokinase.
AB  - Expression of the Zymomonas mobilis glf (glucose facilitator protein) and glk (glucokinase) genes in Escherichia coli ZSC113 (glucose negative) provided a new functional pathway for glucose uptake and phosphorylation. Both genes were essential for the restoration of growth in glucose minimal medium and for acid production on glucose-MacConkey agar plates.
TI  - Metal-catalyzed oxidation of Fe2+ dehydrogenases. Consensus target sequence between propanediol oxidoreductase of Escherichia coli and alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - We have studied two enzymes of a newly described family of dehydrogenases with high sequence homology, 1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase of Escherichia coli and alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis. These enzymes perform their metabolic role under anaerobic conditions; in the presence of oxygen, they show a very similar inactivation pattern by a metal-catalyzed oxidation system. Titration of histidine residues with diethyl pyrocarbonate showed one histidine residue less in the oxidized enzymes. Comparison of subtilisin peptide maps of active and inactivated enzymes showed a difference in one histidine-containing peptide, the sequence of which is YNTPH277GVAN for propanediol oxidoreductase and YNLPH277GV for alcohol dehydrogenase II. This histidine residue lies 10 residues away from a proposed metal-binding site, H263XXXH267, necessary to explain a site-specific free radical mechanism. The three histidine residues here described are strictly conserved in all enzymes of this family. In this report we propose that histidine 277 is a target for oxidation by a metal-catalyzed oxidation system and that this modification leads to the irreversible inactivation of both enzymes.
TI  - Molecular characterization of microbial alcohol dehydrogenases.
AB  - There is an astonishing array of microbial alcohol oxidoreductases. They display  a wide variety of substrate specificities and they fulfill several vital but quite different physiological functions. Some of these enzymes are involved in the production of alcoholic beverages and of industrial solvents, others are important in the production of vinegar, and still others participate in the degradation of naturally occurring and xenobiotic aromatic compounds as well as in the growth of bacteria and yeasts on methanol. They can be divided into three major categories. (1) The NAD- or NADP-dependent dehydrogenases. These can in turn be divided into the group I long-chain (approximately 350 amino acid residues) zinc-dependent enzymes such as alcohol dehydrogenases I, II, and III of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the plasmid-encoded benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase of Pseudomonas putida; the group II short-chain (approximately 250 residues) zinc-independent enzymes such as ribitol dehydrogenase of Klebsiella aerogenes; the group III "iron-activated" enzymes that generally contain approximately 385 amino acid residues, such as alcohol dehydrogenase II of Zymomonas mobilis and alcohol dehydrogenase IV of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but may contain almost 900 residues in the case of the multifunctional alcohol dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli and Clostridium acetobutylicum. The aldehyde/alcohol oxidoreductase of Amycolatopsis methanolica and the methanol dehydrogenases of A. methanolica and Mycobacterium gasti are 4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline-dependent nicotinoproteins. (2) NAD(P)-independent enzymes that use pyrroloquinoline quinone, haem or cofactor F420 as cofactor, exemplified by methanol dehydrogenase of Paracoccus denitrificans, ethanol dehydrogenase of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter spp. and the alcohol dehydrogenases of certain archaebacteria. (3) Oxidases that catalyze an essentially irreversible oxidation of alcohols, such as methanol oxidase of Hansenula polymorpha and probably the veratryl alcohol oxidases of certain fungi involved in lignin degradation. This review deals mainly with those enzymes for which complete amino acid sequences are available. The discussion focuses on a comparison of their primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures and their catalytic mechanisms. The physiological roles of the enzymes and isoenzymes are also considered, as are their probable evolutionary relationships.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Erwinia chrysanthemi region containing the kdgA and zwf genes.
AB  - The pathways of pectin and galacturonate catabolism in Erwinia chrysanthemi converge to form a common intermediate, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate, which is phosphorylated to form 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDGP) and then cleaved by the aldolase encoded by the kdgA gene. We cloned the kdgA gene of the E. chrysanthemi strain 3937 by complementing an Escherichia coli kdgA mutation, using an RP4-derivative plasmid. Restriction mapping of the kdgA region and isolation of kdgA-lac fusions allowed the more precise localization of the kdgA gene and determination of its transcriptional direction. The nucleotide sequence of the kdgA region indicated that the kdgA reading frame is 639 bases long, corresponding to a protein of 213 amino acids with a molecular mass of 22,187 Da. Comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequences of the E. chrysanthemi KDGP-aldolase to the E. coli, Zymomonas mobilis and Pseudomonas putida enzymes showed that they are highly conserved. The E. chrysanthemi kdgA structural gene begins 153 bases downstream of an open reading frame that has a high homology with the zwf E. coli gene encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The zwf gene is also linked to eda (kdgA) in E. coli and P. putida but genetic organization is different. Regulation of zwf and kdgA expression in E. chrysanthemi was analysed using lacZ fusions. The expression of zwf is independent of the growth rate, but is repressed in the presence of glucose. Induction of kdgA by pectin-degradation products is mediated in vivo by the negative regulatory gene kdgR, which also controls all the steps of pectin degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacteria: a novel pathway for the early steps leading  to isopentenyl diphosphate.
AB  - Incorporation of 13C-labelled glucose, acetate, pyruvate or erythrose allowed the determination of the origin of the carbon atoms of triterpenoids of the hopane series and/or of the ubiquinones from several bacteria (Zymomonas mobilis, Methylobacterium fujisawaense, Escherichia coli and Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris) confirmed our earlier results obtained by incorporation of 13C-labelled acetate into the hopanoids of other bacteria and led to the identification of a novel biosynthetic route for the early steps of isoprenoid biosynthesis. The C5 framework of isoprenic units results most probably (i) from the condensation of a C2 unit derived from pyruvate decarboxylation (e.g. thiamine-activated acetaldehyde) on the C-2 carbonyl group of a triose phosphate derivative issued probably from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and not from pyruvate and (ii) from a transposition step. Although this hypothetical biosynthetic pathway resembles that of L-valine biosynthesis, this amino acid or its C5 precursors could be excluded as intermediates in the formation of isoprenic units.
TI  - Isoprenoid biosynthesis in bacteria: two different pathways?
AB  - The biosynthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate, a central intermediate of isoprenoid formation, was investigated in six different bacterial organisms. Cell-free extracts of Myxococcus fulvus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Halobacterium cutirubrum converted [14C]acetyl-CoA or [14C]hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA to [14C]mevalonic acid. Furthermore, [14C]mevalonic acid, [14C]mevalonate-5-phosphate and [14C]mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate were metabolized to [14C]isopentenylpyrophosphate. These data demonstrated the in vitro operation of acetoacetate pathway for the formation of isopentenylpyrophosphate in bacteria. In contrast, no intermediates of this reaction sequence could be detected using cell-free extracts of Zymomonas mobilis and Escherichia coli. These results indicate that at least two different pathways for the biosynthesis of isopentenylpyrophosphate are present in bacteria.
TI  - The aroQ-encoded monofunctional chorismate mutase (CM-F) protein is a periplasmic enzyme in Erwinia herbicola.
AB  - Enteric bacteria possess two species of chorismate mutase which exist as catalytic domains on the amino termini of the bifunctional PheA and TyrA proteins. In addition, some of these organisms possess a third chorismate mutase, CM-F, which exists as a small monofunctional protein. The CM-F gene (denoted aroQ) from Erwinia herbicola was cloned and sequenced for the first time. A strategy for selection by functional complementation in a chorismate mutase-free Escherichia coli background was devised by using a recombinant plasmid derivative of pUC18 carrying a Zymomonas mobilis tyrC insert which encodes cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. The aroQ gene is 543 bp in length, predicting a 181-residue protein product having a calculated molecular mass of 20,299 Da. The E. herbicola aroQ promoter is recognized by E. coli, and a putative sigma-70 promoter region was identified. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified CM-F protein indicated cleavage of a 20-residue signal peptide. This was consistent with the monomeric molecular mass determined for the enzyme of about 18,000 Da. The native enzyme is a homodimer. The implied translocation of CM-F was confirmed by osmotic shock experiments which demonstrated a periplasmic location. Immunogold electron microscopy indicated a polar localization within the periplasm. Polyclonal antibody raised against E. herbicola CM-F did not cross-react with the CM-F protein from the closely related Serratia rubidaea, as well as from a number of other gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, when the E. herbicola aroQ gene was used as a probe in Southern blot hybridizations with EcroRI digests of chromosomal DNA from S. rubidaea and other enteric organisms, no hybridization was detected at low stringency. Thus, the aroQ gene appears to be unusually divergent among closely related organisms. The deduced CM-F amino acid sequence did not exhibit compelling evidence for homology with the monofunctional chorismate mutase protein of Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the Zymomonas mobilis phosphoglycerate mutase gene (pgm) in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Phosphoglycerate mutase is an essential glycolytic enzyme for Zymomonas mobilis,  catalyzing the reversible interconversion of 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate. The pgm gene encoding this enzyme was cloned on a 5.2-kbp DNA fragment and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinants were identified by using antibodies directed against purified Z. mobilis phosphoglycerate mutase. The pgm gene contains a canonical ribosome-binding site, a biased pattern of codon usage, a long upstream untranslated region, and four promoters which share sequence homology. Interestingly, adhA and a D-specific 2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase were found on the same DNA fragment and appear to form a cluster of genes which function in central metabolism. The translated sequence for Z. mobilis pgm was in full agreement with the 40 N-terminal amino acid residues determined by protein sequencing. The primary structure of the translated sequence is highly conserved (52 to 60% identity with other phosphoglycerate mutases) and also shares extensive homology with bisphosphoglycerate mutases (51 to 59% identity). Since Southern blots indicated the presence of only a single copy of pgm in the Z. mobilis chromosome, it is likely that the cloned pgm gene functions to provide both activities. Z. mobilis phosphoglycerate mutase is unusual in that it lacks the flexible tail and lysines at the carboxy terminus which are present in the enzyme isolated from all other organisms examined.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of the dnaK gene of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The DnaK protein of Zymomonas mobilis (DnaKz) was identified and found to be 80%  identical to the DnaK protein of Escherichia coli on the basis of the sequence of the N-terminal 21 amino acids. The dnaKz gene was cloned and found to be expressed in a thermosensitive dnaK mutant of Escherichia coli. Expression of the foreign gene restored a thermoresistant phenotype but failed to modulate the heat shock response in E. coli.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of the scrK gene encoding fructokinase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A gene encoding an ATP-dependent fructokinase from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was  identified within a 2 kb DNA fragment immediately downstream from the scrA gene. The gene cloned in Escherichia coli also expressed mannokinase activity. Insertional inactivation of this gene in S. mutans markedly decreased both fructokinase and mannokinase activities. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2 kb fragment revealed an ORF starting 199 bp downstream from the scrA gene, preceded by potential ribosome-binding (Shine-Dalgarno) and promoter-like sequences. This ORF specified a putative protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 31,681. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fructokinase gene, scrK, from S. mutans exhibited no significant similarity to fructokinase genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli plasmid pUR400 or Vibrio alginolyticus, but was similar to a comparable gene from Zymomonas mobilis.
TI  - Mutational analysis of segmental stabilization of transcripts from the Zymomonas  mobilis gap-pgk operon.
AB  - In Zymomonas mobilis, the genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase are transcribed together from the gap-pgk operon. However, higher levels of the former enzyme are present in the cytoplasm because of increased stability of a 5' segment containing the gap coding region. This segment is bounded by an upstream untranslated region which can be folded into many stem-loop structures and a prominent intercistronic stem-loop. Mutations eliminating a proposed stem-loop in the untranslated region or the intercistronic stem-loop resulted in a decrease in the stability and pool size of the 5' gap segment. Site-specific mutations in the unpaired regions of both of these stems also altered the message pools. Elimination of the intercistronic stem appeared to reduce the endonucleolytic cleavage within the pgk coding region, increasing the stability and abundance of the full-length message. DNA encoding the prominent stem-loop at the 3' end of the message was shown to be a transcriptional terminator both in Z. mobilis and in Escherichia coli. This third stem-loop region (part of the transcriptional terminator) was required to stabilize the full-length gap-pgk message.
TI  - An allosterically insensitive class of cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The key enzyme of tyrosine biosynthesis in many Gram-negative prokaryotes is cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase. The Zymomonas mobilis gene (tyrC) coding for this enzyme was cloned in Escherichia coli by complementation of a tyrosine auxotroph. The tyrC gene was 882 bp long, encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 32086 Da. The Z. mobilis cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase expressed in E. coli was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The subunit molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 32 kDa as determined by SDS/PAGE. The ratio of the activity of arogenate dehydrogenase to that of prephenate dehydrogenase (approximately 3:1) remained constant throughout purification, and the two activities were therefore inseparable. The genetic and biochemical data obtained demonstrated a single enzyme protein capable of catalyzing either of two reactions. Km values of 0.25 mM and 0.18 mM were obtained from prephenate and L-arogenate, respectively. The Km value obtained for NAD+ (0.09 mM) was the same regardless of whether the enzyme was assayed as arogenate dehydrogenase or as prephenate dehydrogenase. Unlike the corresponding enzyme of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or E. coli, the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase of Z. mobilis lacks sensitivity to feedback inhibition by L-tyrosine. A typical NAD(+)-binding domain was found to be located at the N-terminus of the protein. Although the deduced amino-acid sequence of the Z. mobilis cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase showed relatively low identity (19-32%) with the prephenate dehydrogenases of Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as with the cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase components of the bifunctional T-proteins of E. coli and Erwinia herbicola, a presumptive motif was identified which may correspond to critical residues of the binding site for cyclohexadienyl substrate molecules. Immediately upstream of tryC a portion of a gene was sequenced and found to exhibit clearcut homology of the deduced amino-acid sequence with the B. subtilis hisH gene product. Thus, the Zymomonas gene organization is reminiscent of the linkage of genes encoding a tryosine-pathway dehydrogenase and a histidine-pathway aminotransferase in B. subtilis.
TI  - An ultraviolet-sensitive mutant of Zymomonas mobilis affecting the stability of its natural plasmid pZMO2.
AB  - Plasmid pZMO2, a 1.9-kb natural plasmid of Zymomonas mobilis strain ATCC 10988, was found to be absent from the extract of a mutant isolate sensitive to ultraviolet irradiation, methyl methanesulfonic acid, and mitomycin C. This mutant, named uvs51, also exhibited extremely high segregational instability of the recombinant plasmid pDS212, whose maintenance in the parental strain is known to be due to pZMO2 sequences. Helped conjugations, employing uvs51 as recipient with Escherichia coli donors containing the conjugative plasmid pRK2013 and a mobilizable recombinant plasmid carrying the Rhizobium meliloti recA gene, showed complementation of uvs51 with the recA functions. Moreover, uvs51/recA stable transconjugants, containing the recA sequence integrated into their chromosomes, showed an increased stability of recombinant plasmid pDS212. The data presented here indicate that the stable maintenance of the natural plasmid pZMO2 in Z. mobilis is affected by a putative recA function.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the gene encoding gluconolactonase from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The gene encoding the enzyme gluconolactonase (D-glucono-delta-lactone lactonohydrolase, EC 3.1.1.17) has been isolated from a recombinant library of genomic Zymomonas mobilis DNA, by detection of enzyme activity in recombinant clones. The gene encoded a protein of 320 amino acids, which is processed to the mature enzyme of 285 amino acids (31079 Da) by cleavage at an Ala-Ala bond, as determined from N-terminal sequencing of the purified enzyme. A minor sequence commencing at amino acid 6 is suggestive of an alternative start of translation at the ATG codon of amino acid 5; in this case the expressed enzyme would remain cytoplasmic, whereas it is presumed that the main portion is directed to the membrane of periplasm by the leader sequence.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a phoA gene encoding a phosphate-irrepressible alkaline phosphatase of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis phoA gene, encoding a phosphate-irrepressible alkaline phosphatase (ZAPase), was cloned and its expression was studied in phoA mutants of Escherichia coli. The ZAPase was recovered in the soluble fraction of E. coli. The enzyme was synthesized constitutively and its synthesis not repressed by phosphate, unlike the phoA gene of E. coli. The phoA gene of Z. mobilis was mutagenized by Mini Mu PR13 and the mutated gene crossed into Z. mobilis in order to obtain phoA mutants by reverse genetics. Although Z. mobilis mutants with Mini Mu PR13 integrated in the chromosome were obtained, none had an allele replacement for none was defective in ZAPase.
TI  - Use of the tac promoter and lacIq for the controlled expression of Zymomonas mobilis fermentative genes in Escherichia coli and Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase I (adhA), alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB), and pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and Z. mobilis by using a broad-host-range vector containing the tac promoter and the lacIq repressor gene. Maximal IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) induction of these plasmid-borne genes in Z. mobilis resulted in a 35-fold increase in alcohol dehydrogenase I activity, a 16.7-fold increase in alcohol dehydrogenase II activity, and a 6.3-fold increase in pyruvate decarboxylase activity. Small changes in the activities of these enzymes did not affect glycolytic flux in cells which are at maximal metabolic activity, indicating that flux under these conditions is controlled at some other point in metabolism. Expression of adhA, adhB, or pdc at high specific activities (above 8 IU/mg of cell protein) resulted in a decrease in glycolytic flux (negative flux control coefficients), which was most pronounced for pyruvate decarboxylase. Growth rate and flux are imperfectly coupled in this organism. Neither a twofold increase in flux nor a 50% decline from maximal flux caused any immediate change in growth rate. Thus, the rates of biosynthesis and growth in this organism are not limited by energy generation in rich medium.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an alkaline phosphatase (phoA) gene from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - An alkaline phosphatase (phoA) gene from Zymomonas mobilis was isolated in Escherichia coli CC118 by use of the plasmid Bluescript KS+. The origin of the 6.4-kb DNA fragment in pZAP1 from the chromosome of Z. mobilis was confirmed by Southern blotting and hybridization studies. The Z. mobilis phoA gene was localized at one end of the chromosomal insert on plasmid pZAP1. The Z. mobilis phoA gene was expressed from its own promoter in E. coli, and the enzyme was localized to the periplasmic space. Z. mobilis alkaline phosphatase activity in E. coli was repressed in high-phosphate media and derepressed under a phosphate-limited growth condition. These results suggest that Z. mobilis alkaline phosphatase is subjected to normal regulation in E. coli.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Zymomonas mobilis enolase (eno) gene.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis gene encoding enolase was cloned by genetic complementation of an Escherichia coli eno mutant. An enzyme assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the overexpression of enolase in E. coli clones carrying the Z. mobilis eno gene. The eno gene is present in a single copy of the Z. mobilis genome. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the eno region revealed an open reading frame of 1,293 bp that encodes a protein of 428 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 45,813. Comparison of the sequence of Z. mobilis enolase with primary amino acid sequences for other enolases indicates that the enzyme is highly conserved. Unlike all of the previously studied glycolytic genes from Z. mobilis that possess canonical ribosome binding sites, the eno gene is preceded by a modest Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The transcription initiation site was mapped by primer extension and found to be located within a 115-bp sequence that is 55.7% identical to a highly conserved consensus sequence found within the regulatory regions of highly expressed Z. mobilis genes. Northern RNA blot analysis revealed that eno is encoded on a 1.45-kb transcript. The half-life of the eno mRNA was determined to be 17.7 +/- 1.7 min, indicating that it is unusually stable. The abundance of the eno message is proposed to account for enolase being the most prevalent protein in Z. mobilis.
TI  - Cloning and molecular characterization of the DNA ligase gene (lig) from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis lig gene that encodes DNA ligase was cloned from a cosmid library and identified by genetic complementation of a conditional-lethal Escherichia coli DNA ligase mutant. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Z. mobilis lig region indicated that the gene is 2196 bp long, encoding a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 82,089. The primary amino acid sequence of the Z. mobilis ligase is 48% identical to the E. coli enzyme. Two genes located upstream of lig were identified as tgt, encoding tRNA guanine transglycosylase and uvrB, encoding the beta subunit of excision endonuclease. Computer searches did not reveal any transcriptional terminators in the 46-bp tgt-lig intergenic region, suggesting that lig may be cotranscribed with one or more upstream genes. Weak expression of lig is explained in part by frequent use of codons that are known to be rarely used in the highly expressed glycolytic gene set.
TI  - The Entner-Doudoroff pathway: history, physiology and molecular biology.
AB  - The Entner-Doudoroff pathway is now known to be very widely distributed in nature. Biochemical and physiological studies show that the Entner-Doudoroff pathway can operate in a linear and catabolic mode, in a 'cyclic' mode, in a modified mode involving non-phosphorylated intermediates, or in alternative modes involving C1 metabolism and anabolism. Molecular and genetic analyses of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in Zymomonas mobilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have led to an improved understanding of some fundamental aspects of metabolic controls. It can be argued that the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is more primitive than Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas glycolysis.
TI  - Broad host range plasmids carrying the Escherichia coli lactose and galactose operons.
AB  - We have developed a number of broad-host-range plasmids that allow the expression of the Escherichia coli lac operon from any cloned promoter, and the creation of 'in phase' fusions between lacZ and other cloned genes. In a second series of constructions, the E. coli gal operon has been cloned into the broad-host-range vector and a plasmid carrying both the E. coli gal and lac genes is described. These plasmids have been transferred into Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Zymomonas mobilis and their effects on the utilisation of lactose and galactose have been investigated.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in Escherichia coli: sequence analysis and localization of promoters for the edd-eda operon.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the entire Escherichia coli edd-eda region that encodes the enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway was determined. The edd structural gene begins 236 bases downstream of zwf. The eda structural gene begins 34 bases downstream of edd. The edd reading frame is 1,809 bases long and encodes the 602-amino-acid, 64,446-Da protein 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase. The deduced primary amino acid sequences of the E. coli and Zymomonas mobilis dehydratase enzymes are highly conserved. The eda reading frame is 642 bases long and encodes the 213-amino-acid, 22,283-Da protein 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase. This enzyme had been previously purified and sequenced by others on the basis of its related enzyme activity, 2-keto-4-hydroxyglutarate aldolase. The data presented here provide proof that the two enzymes are identical. The primary amino acid sequences of the E. coli, Z. mobilis, and Pseudomonas putida aldolase enzymes are highly conserved. When E. coli is grown on gluconate, the edd and eda genes are cotranscribed. Four putative promoters within the edd-eda region were identified by transcript mapping and computer analysis. P1, located upstream of edd, appears to be the primary gluconate-responsive promoter of the edd-eda operon, responsible for induction of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, as mediated by the gntR product. High basal expression of eda is explained by constitutive transcription from P2, P3, and/or P4 but not P1.
TI  - Characterization of Zymomonas mobilis alkaline phosphatase activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis phoA gene encoding alkaline phosphatase was expressed in Escherichia coli CC118 carrying the recombinant plasmid pZAP1. The pH optimum for this enzyme was 9.0 and showed a peak activity at 42 degrees C. This enzyme required Zn2+ for its catalytic activity; however, Mg2+ or Ca2+ significantly affected the activity. This enzyme was found to be ethanolabile, and ethanol inhibition was reversed by addition of Zn2+. Kinetics of Z. mobilis alkaline phosphatase production in E. coli CC118 (pZAP1) showed that the enzyme activity was growth associated and localized in the cellular fraction, and the maximum activity was found in the stationary phase.
TI  - Fermentation of sweet whey by ethanologenic Escherichia coli.
AB  - Whey, an abundant byproduct of the dairy industry, contains large amounts of protein and lactose which could be used for fuel ethanol production. We have investigated a new organism as a candidate for such fermentations: recombinant Escherichia coli containing the genes encoding the ethanol pathway from Zymomonas mobilis. The highest level of ethanol achieved, 68 g/L, was produced after 108 hours in Luria broth containing 140 g lactose/L. Fermentations of lower lactose concentrations were completed more rapidly with approximately 88% of theoretical yields. Reconstituted sweet whey (60 g lactose/L)was fermented more slowly than lactose in Luria broth requiring 144 hours to produce 26 g ethanol/L. Supplementing sweet whey with a trace metal mix and ammonium sulfate reduced the required fermentation time to 72 hours and increased final ethanol concentration (28 g ethanol/L). By adding proteinases during fermentation, the requirement for ammonia was completely eliminated, and the rate of fermentation further improved (30 g ethanol/L after 48 hours). This latter increased in rate of ethanol production and ethanol yield are presumed to result from incorporation of amino acids released by hydrolysis of whey proteins. The fermentation of sweet whey by ethanologenic E. coil reduced the nonvolatile residue by approximately 70%. This should reduce biological oxygen demand and reduce the cost of waste treatment. Whey supplemented with trace metals and small amounts of proteinase may represent an economically attractive feedstock for the production of ethanol and other useful chemicals.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the Zymomonas mobilis fructokinase gene and structural comparison of the enzyme with other hexose kinases.
AB  - The frk gene encoding the enzyme fructokinase (fructose 6-phosphotransferase [EC  2.7.1.4]) from Zymomonas mobilis has been isolated on a partial TaqI digest fragment of the genome and sequenced. An open reading frame of 906 bp corresponding to 302 amino acids was identified on a 3-kbp TaqI fragment. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to the first 20 amino acids (including an N-terminal methionine) determined by amino acid sequencing of the purified protein. The 118 bp preceding the methionine codon on this fragment does not appear to contain a promoter sequence. There was weak expression of the active enzyme in the recombinant Escherichia coli clone under control of the lac promoter on the pUC plasmid. Comparison of the amino acid sequence with that of the glucokinase enzyme (EC 2.7.1.2) from Z. mobilis reveals relatively little homology, despite the fact that fructokinase also binds glucose and has kinetic and structural properties similar to those of glucokinase. Also, there is little homology with hexose kinases that have been sequenced from other organisms. Northern (RNA) blot analysis showed that the frk transcript is 1.2 kb long. Fructokinase activity is elevated up to twofold when Z. mobilis was grown on fructose instead of glucose, and there was a parallel increase in frk mRNA levels. Differential mRNA stability was not a factor, since the half-lives of the frk transcript were 6.2 min for glucose-grown cells and 6.6 min for fructose-grown cells.
TI  - Cloning, sequence analysis, and expression of the structural gene encoding glucose-fructose oxidoreductase from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The gene encoding glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (gfo) from Zymomonas mobilis was cloned in Escherichia coli and sequenced. An open reading frame of 439 amino acids encoded a protein of 49 kDa. A leader sequence of 52 amino acids preceded the N-terminal sequence of the enzyme, indicating cleavage of the precursor protein at an Ala-Ala site to give rise to an active form of the enzyme of 43 kDa. Processing of the glucose-fructose oxidoreductase leader sequence, although not complete, was demonstrated in an in vitro translation system. The two Z. mobilis promoters of the gfo gene show considerable homology to other highly expressed Z. mobilis genes (pdc, adhB, gap, and pgk) as well as to the E. coli consensus sequence. Although translation of the gfo gene was demonstrated in vitro in an E. coli S30 coupled transcription-translation system, a functional stable protein was not produced in the E. coli clone. However, the gfo gene cloned into a shuttle vector was shown to overexpress glucose-fructose oxidoreductase to levels of up to 6% of the soluble protein in Z. mobilis.
TI  - Effects of substitution of aspartate-440 and tryptophan-487 in the thiamin diphosphate binding region of pyruvate decarboxylase from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - A tryptophan residue at position 487 in Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase  was altered to leucine by site-directed mutagenesis. This modified Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase was active when expressed in Escherichia coli and had unchanged kinetics towards pyruvate. The enzyme showed a decreased affinity for the cofactors with the half-saturating concentrations increasing from 0.64 to 9.0 microM for thiamin diphosphate and from 4.21 to 45 microM for Mg2+. Unlike the wild-type enzyme, there was little quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon adding cofactors to this modified form. The data suggest that tryptophan-487 is close to the cofactor binding site but is not required absolutely for pyruvate decarboxylase activity. Substitution of asparagine, threonine or glycine for aspartate-440, a residue which is conserved between many thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes, completely abolishes enzyme activity.
TI  - Influence of expression of the pet operon on intracellular metabolic fluxes of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Fermentation patterns of Escherichia coli HB101 carrying plasmids expressing cloned genes of Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase li (ADH) were determined in glucose-limited complex medium in pH-controlled anaerobic batch cultivations. Time profiles of glucose, dry cell weight, succinate, formate, acetate, and ethanol were determined, as were the activities of ADH and PDC. Fluxes through the central carbon pathways were calculated for each construct utilizing exponential phase data on extracellular components and assuming quasi-steady state for intermediate metabolites. Overall biomass yields were greatest for cells expressing both PDC and ADH activities. Yields of carbon catabolite end products were similar for all PDC-expressing strains and different from those for other strains. Relative to its glucose uptake rate, the strain with greatest PDC and ADH activities produces formate and acetate more slowly and ethanol more rapidly than other strains. Strong influences of plasmid presence and metabolic coupling complicate detailed interpretations of the data.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of a gene from Bacillus stearothermophilus var. non-diastaticus encoding a glycerol dehydrogenase.
AB  - A 4.1-kb EcoRI fragment which includes the gene (gldA) encoding a glycerol dehydrogenase (G1DH; EC 1.1.1.6; glycerol:NAD oxidoreductase) from Bacillus stearothermophilus var. non-diastaticus has been cloned by virtue of its ability to restore glycerol utilisation to Escherichia coli glycerol kinase (glpK) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpD) mutants. Sequencing suggests that the gldA gene is likely to be monocistronic and encodes a protein of 39450 Da. The deduced amino acid composition and sequence of G1DH reveals that the protein is extremely similar to a characterized metal-dependent NAD-dependent G1DH from B. stearothermophilus RS93. The enzyme has limited homology to the iron-activated alcohol dehydrogenase of Zymomonas mobilis and the butanol dehydrogenase of Clostridium acetobutylicum.
TI  - Effect of acetic acid on xylose conversion to ethanol by genetically engineered E. coli.
AB  - Efficient utilization of the pentosan fraction of hemicellulose from lignocellulosic feedstocks offers an opportunity to increase the yield and to reduce the cost of producing fuel ethanol. During prehydrolysis (acid hydrolysis or autohydrolysis of hemicellulose), acetic acid is formed as a consequence of the deacetylation of the acetylated moiety of hemicellulose. Recombinant Escherichia coli B (ATCC 11303), carrying the plasmid pLO1297 with pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II genes from Zymomonas mobilis (CP4), converts xylose to ethanol with a product yield that approaches theoretical maximum. Although other pentose-utilizing microorganisms are inhibited by acetic acid, the recombinant E. coli displays a high tolerance for acetic acid. In xylose fermentations with a synthetic medium (Luria broth), where the pH was controlled at 7, neither yield nor productivity was affected by the addition of 10.7 g/L acetic acid. Nutrient-supplemented, hardwood (aspen) hemicellulose hydrolysate (40.7 g/L xylose) was completely fermented to ethanol (16.3 g/L) in 98 h. When the acetic acid concentration was reduced from 5.6 to 0.8 g/L, the fermentation time decreased to 58 h. Overliming, with Ca(OH)2 to pH 10, followed by neutralization to pH 7 with sulfuric acid and removal of insolubles, resulted in a twofold increase in volumetric productivity. The maximum productivity was 0.93 g/L/h. The xylose-to-ethanol conversion efficiency and productivity in Ca(OH)2-treated hardwood prehydrolysate, fortified with only mineral salts, were 94% and 0.26 g/L/h, respectively. The recombinant E. coli exhibits a xylose-to-ethanol conversion efficiency that is superior to that of other pentose-utilizing yeasts currently being investigated for the production of fuel ethanol from lignocellulosic materials.
TI  - Effect of alteration of the acetic acid synthesis pathway on the fermentation pattern of escherichia coli.
AB  - The glucose metabolism of an Escherichia coli strain bearing mutations abolishing both acetyl phosphotransferase (PTA) and acetate kinase (ACK) activities was studied under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. These studies were conducted in a complex medium with the mutant carrying no plasmid, the mutant carrying the common cloning vector pUC19, and the mutant carrying a plasmid bearing the "pet" operon that encodes Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities. The mutant carrying no plasmid showed lower specific growth and glucose uptake rates relative to the parent wild-type strain (K-12), Lactic acid was produced at higher levels than the wild type, and considerable amounts of pyruvic acid were secreted as an unusual byproduct. Analysis of other fermentation products showed low but significant amounts of acetic acid, no accumulation of formic acid, and lower secretion of succinate and ethanol. The maintenance of the plasmid pUC19 in the mutant negatively affected metabolism. Expression of the pet operon overcame the metabolic stress caused by the plasmid, enhancing growth and glucose uptake rates to the values observed in the plasmidfree mutant. Also, expression of the pet operon allowed consumption of pyruvate accumulated during the first hours of fermentation.
TI  - Cloning, characterization and expression of the Zymononas mobilis eda gene that encodes 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway.
AB  - The eda gene that encodes 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway was cloned from Zymomonas mobilis by genetic complementation of an Escherichia coli mutant. The gene is present in a single copy on the Z. mobilis genome and is not tightly linked to the edd gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the eda region revealed that the structural gene is 627 bp long and capable of encoding a protein of 208 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 21,505. The eda gene is monocistronic and is transcribed from a single promoter. The transcriptional initiation site was determined and an improved consensus promoter sequence for Z. mobilis was derived. High-level expression of the eda gene can be attributed to very efficient translational initiation caused by the high quality of the ribosome-binding site and stability of the mRNA, which has a decay rate of 7.6 min. A comparison of highly expressed Z. mobilis genes indicated that the relative quality of the ribosome-binding sites of these genes might play an important role in determining the level of enzyme synthesis. This possibility is discussed with regard to the role of gene expression in co-ordinating the enzyme levels of the Entner-Doudoroff glycolytic pathway.
TI  - Gel electrophoretic analysis of Zymomonas mobilis glycolytic and fermentative enzymes: identification of alcohol dehydrogenase II as a stress protein.
AB  - The 13 major enzymes which compose the glycolytic and fermentative pathways in Zymomonas mobilis are particularly abundant and represent one-half of the soluble protein in exponential-phase cells. One- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis maps were developed for 12 of these enzymes. Assignments were made by comigration with purified proteins, comparison with overexpressed genes in recombinant strains, and Western blots (immunoblots). Although most glycolytic enzymes appeared resistant to turnover and accumulated in stationary-phase cells, the protein levels of pyruvate kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase I, and glucokinase declined. Alcohol dehydrogenase II was identified as a major stress protein and was induced both by exposure to ethanol and by elevated temperature (45 degrees C). This enzyme, encoded by the adhB gene, is expressed from tandem promoters which share partial sequence identity with the Escherichia coli consensus sequence for heat shock proteins.
TI  - Metabolic engineering of Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 for ethanol production from xylose and glucose.
AB  - The efficient diversion of pyruvate from normal fermentative pathways to ethanol  production in Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 requires the expression of Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding both pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase. Final ethanol concentrations obtained with the best recombinant, strain M5A1 (pLOI555), were in excess of 40 g/liter with an efficiency of 0.48 g of ethanol (xylose) and 0.50 g of ethanol (glucose) per g of sugar, as compared with a theoretical maximum of 0.51 g of ethanol per g of sugar. The maximal volumetric productivity per hour for both sugars was 2.0 g/liter. This volumetric productivity with xylose is almost twice that previously obtained with ethanologenic Escherichia coli. Succinate was also produced as a minor product during fermentation.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of mercuric ion resistance coding genes from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - From a genomic library of Zymomonas mobilis prepared in Escherichia coli, two clones (carrying pZH4 and pZH5) resistant to the mercuric ion were isolated. On partial restriction analysis these two clones appeared to have the same 2.9 kb insert. Mercuric reductase activity was assayed from the Escherichia coli clone carrying pZH5 and it was Hg(2+)-inducible, NADH dependent and also required 2-mercaptoethanol for its activity. The plasmid pZH5 encoded three polypeptides, mercuric reductase (merA; 65 kDa), a transport protein (merT 18-17 kDa) and merC (15 kDa) as analysed by SDS-PAGE. Southern blot analysis showed the positive signal for the total DNA prepared from Hgr Z. mobilis but not with the Hgs strain which was cured for a plasmid (30 kb). These results were also confirmed by isolating this plasmid from Hgr Z. mobilis and transforming into E. coli. Moreover the plasmid pZH5 also hybridized with the mer probes derived from Tn21.
TI  - Expression of an L-alanine dehydrogenase gene in Zymomonas mobilis and excretion  of L-alanine.
AB  - An approach to broaden the product range of the ethanologenic, gram-negative bacterium Zymomonas mobilis by means of genetic engineering is presented. Gene alaD for L-alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1.) from Bacillus sphaericus was cloned and introduced into Z. mobilis. Under the control of the strong promoter of the pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) gene, the enzyme was expressed up to a specific activity of nearly 1 mu mol . min -1 . mg of protein -1 in recombinant cells. As a results of this high L-alanine dehydrogenase activity, growing cells excreted up to 10 mmol of alanine per 280 mmol of glucose utilized into a mineral salts medium. By the addition of 85 mM NH4+ to the medium, growth of the recombinant cells stopped, and up to 41 mmol alanine was secreted. As alanine dehydrogenase competed with pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) (EC 4.1.1.1.) for the same substrate (pyruvate), PDC activity was reduced by starvation for the essential PDC cofactor thiamine PPi. A thiamine auxotrophy mutant of Z. mobilis which carried the alaD gene was starved for 40 h in glucose-supplemented mineral salts medium and then shifted to mineral salts medium with 85 mM NH4+ and 280 mmol of glucose. The recombinants excreted up to 84 mmol of alanine (7.5 g/liter) over 25 h. Alanine excretion proceeded at an initial velocity of 238 nmol . min-1 . mg [dry weight]-1. Despite this high activity, the excretion rate seemed to be a limiting factor, as the intracellular concentration of alanine was as high as 260 mM at the beginning of the excretion phase and decreased to 80 to 90 mM over 24 h.
TI  - Cloning, characterization, and nucleotide sequence analysis of a Zymomonas mobilis phosphoglucose isomerase gene that is subject to carbon source-dependent regulation.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis gene encoding phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi) was cloned by  genetic complementation of an Escherichia coli pgi mutant. An enzyme assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of excess amounts of phosphoglucose isomerase in E. coli clones carrying the Z. mobilis pgi gene. The pgi gene is present in only one copy on the Z. mobilis genome. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the pgi region revealed an open reading frame of 1,524 bp preceded by a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The pgi gene encodes a 507-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 55,398. Z. mobilis phosphoglucose isomerase is between 38 and 43% identical to the enzyme from other species. Northern (RNA) blot analysis showed that the pgi transcript is 1.8 kb in length. The level of the pgi transcript was found to be influenced by the phase of growth and by the carbon and energy sources. Transcript levels increased with respect to total RNA during logarithmic growth and were threefold higher when grown on fructose than on glucose. These changes in transcript levels paralleled phosphoglucose isomerase activities in the cultures. Differential mRNA stability was not a factor, since the half-life of the pgi transcript was 6.3 min in glucose-grown cells and 6.0 min in fructose-grown cells. Thus, an increase in the rate of transcription appears to be at least partially responsible for the increased levels of phosphoglucose isomerase observed for Z. mobilis grown on fructose.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the intracellular invertase gene from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The structural gene for the intracellular invertase E1 of Zymomonas mobilis strain Z6C was cloned in a 2.25-kb DNA fragment on pUSH11, and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101. The enzyme produced by the E. coli carrying pUSH11 was purified about 1,122 fold to homogenicity with a yield of 4%. The molecular weight and substrate specificity of the enzyme were identical with those of the intracellular invertase E1 from Z. mobilis. The nucleotides of the cloned DNA were sequenced; they included an open reading frame of 1,536 bp, coding for a protein with a molecular weight of 58,728. The N-terminal amino acid sequence predicted was identical with the sequence of the first 20 N-terminal amino acid residues of the protein obtained by Edman degradation. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of E1 protein with those of the four other known beta-D-fructofuranosidases from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated a stronger homology in the N-terminal portion than in the C-terminal portion.
TI  - Genetic improvement of Escherichia coli for ethanol production: chromosomal integration of Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis genes for pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) were integrated into the Escherichia coli chromosome within or near the pyruvate formate-lyase gene (pfl). Integration improved the stability of the Z. mobilis genes in E. coli, but further selection was required to increase expression. Spontaneous mutants were selected for resistance to high level of chloramphenicol that also expressed high levels of the Z. mobilis genes. Analogous mutants were selected for increased expression of alcohol dehydrogenase on aldehyde indicator plates. These mutants were functionally equivalent to the previous plasmid-based strains for the fermentation of xylose and glucose to ethanol. Ethanol concentrations of 54.4 and 41.6 g/liter were obtained from 10% glucose and 8% xylose, respectively. The efficiency of conversion exceeded theoretical limits (0.51 g of ethanol/g of sugar) on the basis of added sugars because of the additional production of ethanol from the catabolism of complex nutrients. Further mutations were introduced to inactivate succinate production (frd) and to block homologous recombination (recA).
TI  - Molecular cloning of the gene for indolepyruvate decarboxylase from Enterobacter  cloacae.
AB  - Although indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a well-known plant hormone, the main IAA biosynthetic pathway from L-tryptophan (Trp) via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) has yet to be elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that IAA is produced by Enterobacter cloacae isolated from the rhizosphere of cucumbers and its biosynthetic pathway may possibly be the same as that in plants. To elucidate this pathway, the IAA biosynthetic gene was isolated from a genomic library of E. cloacae by assaying for the ability to convert Trp to IAA. DNA sequence analysis showed that this gene codes for only one enzyme and its predicted protein sequence has extensive homology with pyruvate decarboxylase in yeast and Zymomonas mobilis. Cell-free extracts prepared from Escherichia coli harboring this gene could convert IPyA to indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld). These results clearly show that this pathway is mediated only by indolepyruvate decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of IPyA to IAAld.
TI  - Electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1.
AB  - Methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant Bacillus sp. C1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. Two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. Subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. The rectangular views can be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. It is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. The estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. The enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zymomonas mobilis, Clostridium acetobutylicum, and Escherichia coli, which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. In view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.1) by using the name NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.
TI  - Ethanol production by recombinant Escherichia coli carrying genes from Zymomonas  mobilis.
AB  - Efficient utilization of lignocellulosic feedstocks offers an opportunity to reduce the cost of producing fuel ethanol. The fermentation performance characteristics of recombinant Escherichia coli ATCC 11303 carrying the "PET plasmid" (pLOI297) with the lac operon controlling the expression of pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) genes cloned from Zymomonas mobilis CP4 (Alterthum & Ingram, 1989) were assessed in batch and continuous processes with sugar mixtures designed to mimic process streams from lignocellulosic hydrolysis systems. Growth was pseudoexponential at a rate (generation time) of 1.28 h at pH 6.8 and 1.61 h at pH 6.0. The molar growth yields for glucose and xylose were 17.28 and 7.65 g DW cell/mol, respectively (at pH 6.3 and 30 degrees C), suggesting that the net yield of ATP from xylose metabolism is only 50% compared to glucose. In pH-stat batch fermentations (Luria broth with 6% sugar, pH 6.3), glucose was converted to ethanol 4-6 times faster than xylose, but the glucose conversion rate was much less than can be achieved with comparable cell densities of Zymomonas. Sugar-to-ethanol conversion efficiencies in nutrient-rich, complex LB medium were near theoretical at 98 and 88% for glucose and xylose, respectively. The yield was 10-20% less in a defined-mineral-salts medium. Acetate at a concentration of 0.1M (present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates from thermochemical processing) inhibited glucose utilization (about 50%) much more than xylose, and caused a decrease in product yield of about 30% for both sugars. With phosphate-buffered media (pH 7), glucose was a preferred substrate in mixtures with a ratio of hexose to pentose of 2.3 to 1. Xylose was consumed after glucose, and the product yield was less (0.37 g/g). Under steady-state conditions of continuous culture, the specific productivity ranged from 0.76-1.24 g EtOH/g cell/h, and the maximum volumetric productivity, 2.5 g EtOH/L/h, was achieved with a rich complex LB medium (glucose) at pH 6.0 (30 degrees C) and ethanol at 1.63% (v/v). Growth and fermentation were poor in a buffered-wood (aspen) "hemicellulose hydrolysate" containing 4% xylose and 0.1M acetate with added thiamine and mineral salts.
TI  - Segmental message stabilization as a mechanism for differential expression from the Zymomonas mobilis gap operon.
AB  - In Zymomonas mobilis, three- to fourfold more glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein than phosphoglycerate kinase is needed for glycolysis because of differences in catalytic efficiency. Consistent with this requirement, higher levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were observed with two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The genes encoding these enzymes (gap and pgk, respectively) form a bicistronic operon, and some form of regulation is required to provide this differential expression. Two transcripts were observed in Northern RNA analyses with segments of gap as a probe: a more abundant 1.2-kb transcript that contained gap alone and a 2.7-kb transcript that contained both genes. Based on the relative amounts of these transcripts, the coding regions for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were calculated to be fivefold more abundant than those for phosphoglycerate kinase. Assuming equal translational efficiency, this is sufficient to provide the observed differences in expression. Operon fusions with lacZ provided no evidence for intercistronic terminators or attenuation mechanisms. Both gap operon messages were very stable, with half-lives of approximately 16 min (1.2-kb transcript) and 7 min (2.7-kb transcript). Transcript mapping and turnover studies indicated that the shorter gap message was a stable degradation product of the full-length message. Thus differential expression of gap and pgk results primarily from increased translation of the more stable 5' segment of the transcript containing gap. The slow turnover of the messages encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase is proposed as a major feature contributing to the high level of expression of these essential enzymes.
TI  - Sequence and genetic organization of a Zymomonas mobilis gene cluster that encodes several enzymes of glucose metabolism.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis genes that encode glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf),  6-phosphogluconate dehydratase (edd), and glucokinase (glk) were cloned independently by genetic complementation of specific defects in Escherichia coli metabolism. The identity of these cloned genes was confirmed by various biochemical means. Nucleotide sequence analysis established that these three genes are clustered on the genome and revealed an additional open reading frame in this region that has significant amino acid identity to the E. coli xylose-proton symporter and the human glucose transporter. On the basis of this evidence and structural analysis of the deduced primary amino acid sequence, this gene is believed to encode the Z. mobilis glucose-facilitated diffusion protein, glf. The four genes in the 6-kb cluster are organized in the order glf, zwf, edd, glk. The glf and zwf genes are separated by 146 bp. The zwf and edd genes overlap by 8 bp, and their expression may be translationally coupled. The edd and glk genes are separated by 203 bp. The glk gene is followed by tandem transcriptional terminators. The four genes appear to be organized in an operon. Such an arrangement of the genes that govern glucose uptake and the first three steps of the Entner-Doudoroff glycolytic pathway provides the organism with a mechanism for carefully regulating the levels of the enzymes that control carbon flux into the pathway.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the sacA gene: characterization of a sucrase from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis gene (sacA) encoding a protein with sucrase activity has been cloned in Escherichia coli and its nucleotide sequence has been determined. Potential ribosome-binding site and promoter sequences were identified in the region upstream of the gene which were homologous to E. coli and Z. mobilis consensus sequences. Extracts from E. coli cells, containing the sacA gene, displayed a sucrose-hydrolyzing activity. However, no transfructosylation activity (exchange reaction or levan formation) could be detected. This sucrase activity was different from that observed with the purified extracellular protein B46 from Z. mobilis. These two proteins showed different electrophoretic mobilities and molecular masses and shared no immunological similarity. Thus, the product of sacA (a polypeptide of 58.4-kDa molecular mass) is a new sucrase from Z. mobilis. The amino acid sequence, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of sacA, showed strong homologies with the sucrases from Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio alginolyticus.
TI  - Construction of expression vectors for the gram-negative bacterium Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - A set of vectors was constructed for the cloning and expression of heterologous genes in the Gram-negative bacterium Zymomonas mobilis under the control of the pdc promoter of Z. mobilis. The vectors pPTZ1, pPTZ3, and pPTZ4 are based on the cryptic Z. mobilis plasmid pZM02 and on parts of the Escherichia coli plasmids pKK223-3 and pBR322 together with the multiple cloning site of phage M13mp18. DNA fragments can be readily inserted immediately downstream from the pdc promoter at unique restriction sites for KpnI, XbaI and PstI in pPTZ1 and additionally for SmaI and BamHI in pPTZ3. In pPTZ4, the 5' terminal codons of pdc were deleted allowing the formation of gene fusions. Expression of a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) controlled by the pdc gene promoter resulted in enzyme activities of up to 5.5 U/mg total cell protein in Z. mobilis cells.
TI  - Behavior of the hybrid plasmid pNSW301 in Zymomonas mobilis grown in continuous culture.
AB  - The stability of the plasmid pNSW301 which was formed by cointegration of the Inc W R plasmid Sa and the 14.5-kb pNSW1 plasmid of Zymomonas mobilis ZM6100 was investigated in ZM6100(pNSW301) grown in continuous culture without antibiotic selection. The cointegrate plasmid, pNSW301, was found to be structurally unstable and a total reduction in the size of pNSW301 of approximately 21 kb occurred during growth in continuous culture. Following a systematic study, a number of deletion derivatives of pNSW301 were isolated and used to transform Escherichia coli HB101, with the exception of pNSW312. The plasmid pNSW312 was 100% stable in ZM6100(pNSW312) in continuous culture but was unable to replicate in E. coli.
TI  - Cloning of the Zymomonas mobilis structural gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase I (adhA): sequence comparison and expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis ferments sugars to produce ethanol with two biochemically distinct isoenzymes of alcohol dehydrogenase. The adhA gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase I has now been sequenced and compared with the adhB gene, which encodes the second isoenzyme. The deduced amino acid sequences for these gene products exhibited no apparent homology. Alcohol dehydrogenase I contained 337 amino acids, with a subunit molecular weight of 36,096. Based on comparisons of primary amino acid sequences, this enzyme belongs to the family of zinc alcohol dehydrogenases which have been described primarily in eucaryotes. Nearly all of the 22 strictly conserved amino acids in this group were also conserved in Z. mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase I. Alcohol dehydrogenase I is an abundant protein, although adhA lacked many of the features previously reported in four other highly expressed genes from Z. mobilis. Codon usage in adhA is not highly biased and includes many codons which were unused by pdc, adhB, gap, and pgk. The ribosomal binding region of adhA lacked the canonical Shine-Dalgarno sequence found in the other highly expressed genes from Z. mobilis. Although these features may facilitate the expression of high enzyme levels, they do not appear to be essential for the expression of Z. mobilis adhA.
TI  - Activation of the lac genes of Tn951 by insertion sequences from Pseudomonas cepacia.
AB  - We have identified three transposable gene-activating elements from Pseudomonas cepacia on the basis of their abilities to increase expression of the lac genes of the broad-host-range plasmid pGC91.14 (pRP1::Tn951). When introduced into auxotrophic derivatives of P. cepacia 249 (ATCC 17616), this plasmid failed to confer the ability to utilize lactose. The lac genes of Tn951 were poorly expressed in P. cepacia and were not induced by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Lac+ variants of the pGC91.14-containing strains which formed beta-galactosidase at high constitutive levels as a consequence of transposition of insertion sequences from the P. cepacia genome to sites upstream of the lacZ gene of Tn951 were isolated. Certain of the elements also increased gene expression in other bacteria. For example, IS407 strongly activated the lacZ gene of Tn951 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and IS406 (but not IS407) did so in Zymomonas mobilis. The results indicate that IS elements from P. cepacia have potential for turning on the expression of foreign genes in a variety of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Transposable elements for efficient manipulation of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria: promoter probes and vectors for foreign genes.
AB  - We describe here the construction and use of a series of modified transposons based on the insertion sequence IS1. Like their parent, omegon-Km [Fellay et al., Gene 76 (1989) 215-226], these elements permit efficient insertional mutagenesis of a variety of Gram-negative bacteria. The presence of a functional pBR322 origin of replication within the transposable element facilitates subsequent cloning of the mutated gene. The omegon-Km system was previously shown to function in Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium leguminosarum and Paracoccus denitrificans. The results we present here demonstrate that its use can be extended to Xanthomonas campestris, a plant pathogen, and to the microaeroduric Zymomonas mobilis. Derivative transposons carrying unique restriction sites for ScaI, NdeI, XbaI and XhoI have been constructed, allowing the cloning and introduction of foreign genes. We have also constructed two derivatives which can be used to generate operon fusions upon insertion and are thus useful for isolating and characterising indigenous promoters. One carries a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT)-encoding gene (cat) and the second, the entire promoterless Escherichia coli lac operon. We demonstrate the utility of the cat promoter probe in X. campestris to target conditional promoters inducible by high salt or subject to repression by glucose.
TI  - Differential expression of gap and pgk genes within the gap operon of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - In Zymomonas mobilis, the genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) are encoded in an operon that is transcribed from tandem promoters. The promoter-proximal gap gene is expressed at six- to ninefold higher levels than the pgk gene from chromosomal genes and from multiple copies of plasmid-borne genes. Two dominant transcripts were identified. The smaller, most abundant transcript contained primarily the gap message, whereas the larger, less abundant message contained both genes. The ratio of message levels for gap and pgk was calculated to be 5:1 and is sufficient to account for the observed differences in levels of GAP and PGK. The differences in message abundance are proposed to result from either transcriptional attenuation or preferential degradation of the 3' region encoding pgk. Increases in gene dosage were accompanied by one-third the expected increase in enzymatic activity on the basis of estimates of copy number, consistent with the presence of a limiting, positive regulatory factor. However, GAP and PGK expressions were not reduced from the chromosome in recombinants that contained multiple copies of the gap operon with inactive genes.
TI  - [Cloning the pyruvate decarboxylase gene of Zymomonas mobilis and its expression  in Escherichia coli].
AB  - The pyruvate decarboxylase gene of Zymomonas mobilis CP4 has been cloned in Escherichia coli strain TG1 cells on the pUC18 vector plasmid. Activity of the enzyme in the lysates of the obtained clones is about 30 units per 1 mg of protein. Neither the dependence of the pyruvate decarboxylase activity on the presence of IPTG or glucose in the cultivation medium nor the difference in activity of the enzyme for the clones harbouring the recombinant plasmids with the different orientation of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene to lac-promoter have been demonstrated in the presented work. These facts imply the transcription of pyruvate decarboxylase gene from its own promoter.
TI  - Efficient ethanol production from glucose, lactose, and xylose by recombinant Escherichia coli.
AB  - Lactose and all of the major sugars (glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, and mannose) present in cellulose and hemicellulose were converted to ethanol by recombinant Escherichia coli containing plasmid-borne genes encoding the enzymes for the ethanol pathway from Zymomonas mobilis. Environmental tolerances, plasmid stability, expression of Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase, substrate range, and ethanol production (from glucose, lactose, and xylose) were compared among eight American Type Culture Collection strains. E. coli ATCC 9637(pLO1297), ATCC 11303(pLO1297), and ATCC 15224(pLO1297) were selected for further development on the basis of environmental hardiness and ethanol production. Volumetric ethanol productivities per hour in batch culture were 1.4 g/liter for glucose (12%), 1.3 g/liter for lactose (12%), and 0.64 g/liter for xylose (8%). Ethanol productivities per hour ranged from 2.1 g/g of cell dry weight with 12% glucose to 1.3 g/g of cell dry weight with 8% xylose. The ethanol yield per gram of xylose was higher for recombinant E. coli than commonly reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae with glucose. Glucose (12%), lactose (12%), and xylose (8%) were converted to (by volume) 7.2% ethanol, 6.5% ethanol, and 5.2% ethanol, respectively.
TI  - Similarity of Escherichia coli propanediol oxidoreductase (fucO product) and an unusual alcohol dehydrogenase from Zymomonas mobilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The gene that encodes 1,2-propanediol oxidoreductase (fucO) from Escherichia coli was sequenced. The reading frame specified a protein of 383 amino acids (including the N-terminal methionine), with an aggregate molecular weight of 40,642. The induction of fucO transcription, which occurred in the presence of fucose, was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. In E. coli, the primary fucO transcript was approximately 2.1 kilobases in length. The 5' end of the transcript began more than 0.7 kilobase upstream of the fucO start codon within or beyond the fucA gene. Propanediol oxidoreductase exhibited 41.7% identity with the iron-containing alcohol dehydrogenase II from Zymomonas mobilis and 39.5% identity with ADH4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These three proteins did not share homology with either short-chain or long-chain zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. We propose that these three unusual alcohol dehydrogenases define a new family of enzymes.
TI  - Molecular analysis and nucleotide sequence of the adh1 gene encoding an NADPH-dependent butanol dehydrogenase in the Gram-positive anaerobe Clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2081-bp fragment of Clostridium acetobutylicum DNA containing the adh1 gene was determined. The butanol dehydrogenase gene is referred to as the adh1 gene since it was shown to have activity using butanol and ethanol as substrates. The adh1 gene consisted of 1164 bp and encoded an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme of 388 aa residues with an Mr of 43,274. The adh1 gene was separated from an upstream open reading frame by an intergenic region of 354 bp. No promoter consensus sequences were identified in the intergenic upstream region and the adh1 gene did not appear to be expressed off its own promoter in Escherichia coli. Three separate types of ADH have been recognized. The ADH1 from C. acetobutylicum exhibited 39% homology with the Fe-containing ADH2 from Zymomonas mobilis and 37% homology with the ADH4 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but showed little or no homology with the other characterised types of ADH.
TI  - Pyruvate decarboxylase is like acetolactate synthase (ILV2) and not like the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit.
AB  - Protein sequences of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) derived from cloned yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacterial (Zymomonas mobilis) genes were compared with each other and with sequence databases. Extensive sequence similarities were found between them and with two others: cytochrome-linked pyruvate oxidase from Escherichia coli and acetolactate synthase (ilvI in E. coli; ILV2 gene in S. cerevisiae). All catalyse decarboxylation of pyruvate using thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) as cofactor. General overall similarity suggests common ancestry for these enzymes. None of the sequences was similar to the E1 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase from E. coli which also decarboxylates pyruvate with the help of TPP.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of the principal acid phosphatase, the  phoC+ product, from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis gene encoding acid phosphatase, phoC, has been cloned and sequenced. The gene spans 792 base pairs and encodes an Mr 28,988 polypeptide. This protein was identified as the principal acid phosphatase activity in Z. mobilis by using zymograms and was more active with magnesium ions than with zinc ions. Its promoter region was similar to the -35 "pho box" region of the Escherichia coli pho genes as well as the regulatory sequences for Saccharomyces cerevisiae acid phosphatase (PHO5). A comparison of the gene structure of phoC with that of highly expressed Z. mobilis genes revealed that promoters for all genes were similar in degree of conservation of spacing and identity with the proposed Z. mobilis consensus sequence in the -10 region. The phoC gene contained a 5' transcribed terminus which was AT rich, a weak ribosome-binding site, and less biased codon usage than the highly expressed Z. mobilis genes.
TI  - Cosmid cloning of five Zymomonas trp genes by complementation of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida trp mutants.
AB  - A library of Zymomonas mobilis genomic DNA was constructed in the broad-host-range cosmid pLAFR1. The library was mobilized into a variety of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida trp mutants by using the helper plasmid pRK2013. Five Z. mobilis trp genes were identified by the ability to complement the trp mutants. The trpF, trpB, and trpA genes were on one cosmid, while the trpD and trpC genes were on two separate cosmids. The organization of the Z. mobilis trp genes seems to be similar to the organization found in Rhizobium spp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas acidovorans. The trpF, trpB, and trpA genes appeared to be linked, but they were not closely associated with trpD or trpC genes.
TI  - Localization and mapping of CO2 fixation genes within two gene clusters in Rhodobacter sphaeroides.
AB  - Two fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase structural genes (fbpA and fbpB) have been identified within two unlinked gene clusters that were previously shown to contain the Rhodobacter sphaeroides sequences that code for form I and form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase and phosphoribulokinase. The fbpA and fbpB genes were localized to a region immediately upstream from the corresponding prkA and prkB sequences and were found to be transcribed in the same direction as the phosphoribulokinase and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase genes based on inducible expression of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity directed by the lac promoter. A recombinant plasmid was constructed that contained the tandem fbpA and prkA genes inserted downstream from the lac promoter in plasmid pUC18. Both gene products were expressed in Escherichia coli upon induction of transcription with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside, demonstrating that the two genes can be cotranscribed. A Zymomonas mobilis glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase gene (gap) hybridized to a DNA sequence located approximately 1 kilobase upstream from the form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase gene. Although no corresponding gap sequence was found within the form I gene cluster, an additional region of homology was detected immediately upstream from the sequences that encode the form I and form II ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenases.
TI  - Phosphoglycerate kinase gene from Zymomonas mobilis: cloning, sequencing, and localization within the gap operon.
AB  - The Zymomonas mobilis gene encoding phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.3.2), pgk, has been cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. It consists of 336 amino acids, including the N-terminal methionine, with a molecular weight of 41,384. This promoterless gene is located 225 base pairs downstream from the gap gene and is part of the gap operon. Previous studies have shown that the specific activities of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase do not change coordinately in Z. mobilis, although the two enzymes appear to be under the control of a common promoter. The translated amino acid sequence for the Z. mobilis phosphoglycerate kinase is less conserved than those of eucaryotic genes. A comparison of known sequences for phosphoglycerate kinase revealed a high degree of conservation of structure with 102 amino acid positions being retained by all. In general, the amino acid positions at the boundaries of beta-sheet and alpha-helical regions and those connecting these regions were more highly conserved than the amino acid positions within regions of secondary structure.
TI  - Expression of Different Levels of Ethanologenic Enzymes from Zymomonas mobilis in Recombinant Strains of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The expression of Zymomonas mobilis genes encoding pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II in Escherichia coli converted this organism from the production of organic acids to the production of ethanol. Ethanol was produced during both anaerobic and aerobic growth. The extent to which these ethanologenic enzymes were expressed correlated with the extent of ethanol production. The replacement of organic acids with ethanol as a metabolic product during aerobic and anaerobic growth resulted in dramatic increases in final cell density, indicating that these acids (and the associated decline in pH) are more damaging than the production of ethanol. Of the plasmids examined, the best plasmid for growth and ethanol production expressed pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase II at levels of 6.5 and 2.5 IU/mg of total cell protein, respectively.
TI  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene from Zymomonas mobilis: cloning, sequencing, and identification of promoter region.
AB  - The gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was isolated from a library of Zymomonas mobilis DNA fragments by complementing a deficient strain of Escherichia coli. It contained tandem promoters which were recognized by E. coli but appeared to function less efficiently than the enteric lac promoter in E. coli. The open reading frame for this gene encoded 337 amino acids with an aggregate molecular weight of 36,099 (including the N-terminal methionine). The primary amino acid sequence for this gene had considerable functional homology and amino acid identity with other eucaryotic and bacterial genes. Based on this comparison, the gap gene from Z. mobilis appeared to be most closely related to that of the thermophilic bacteria and to the chloroplast isozymes. Comparison of this gene with other glycolytic enzymes from Z. mobilis revealed a conserved pattern of codon bias and several common features of gene structure. A tentative transcriptional consensus sequence is proposed for Z. mobilis based on comparison of the five known promoters for three glycolytic enzymes.
TI  - Genetic engineering of ethanol production in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The genes encoding essential enzymes of the fermentative pathway for ethanol production in Zymomonas mobilis, an obligately ethanologenic bacterium, were inserted into Escherichia coli under the control of a common promoter. Alcohol dehydrogenase II and pyruvate decarboxylase from Z. mobilis were expressed at high levels in E. coli, resulting in increased cell growth and the production of ethanol as the principal fermentation product from glucose. These results demonstrate that it is possible to change the fermentation products of an organism, such as E. coli, by the addition of genes encoding appropriate enzymes which form an alternative system for the regeneration of NAD+.
TI  - Behavior of the IncW plasmid Sa in Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The stability of the broad-host-range IncW R plasmid Sa in Zymomonas mobilis ZM6100(Sa) was monitored using three antibiotic resistance markers carried by Sa. When grown in batch culture without selection, ZM6100(Sa) rapidly lost the Sa plasmid. When grown with selection for either kanamycin or spectinomycin resistance, the three Sa markers were retained in at least 90% of the population, with spontaneous loss of chloramphenicol resistance being observed in the rest of the population. When ZM6100(Sa) was grown with selection for chloramphenicol resistance, the Sa plasmid either formed a cointegrate plasmid, designated pNSW301, with a native ZM6100 plasmid or was lost except for the chloramphenicol resistance marker. Possible transportation of the chloramphenicol resistance region of Sa to the Z. mobilis chromosome was indicated by hybridization data. The cointegrate plasmid, pNSW301, was maintained stably, except for spontaneous loss of chloramphenicol resistance, in Z. mobilis without selection for 300 generations. pNSW301 was able to replicate in Escherichia coli and was capable of conjugal transfer.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene from Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The gene which encodes alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) from Zymomonas mobilis was cloned in Escherichia coli as a 1.4-kilobase DNA fragment by using a novel indicator plate which directly detects the expression of this activity by recombinant colonies. The DNA sequence for this clone contained an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 383 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 40,141. Although this protein exhibited very little homology with other known alcohol dehydrogenases, the predicted amino acid composition was in excellent agreement with that reported for the purified alcohol dehydrogenase II protein from Z. mobilis. In Z. mobilis, the adhB gene was transcribed from tandem promoters which were separated by 100 base pairs and ended with a transcriptional terminator (13-base-pair palindrome). In Escherichia coli, only one of the Z. mobilis promoters was used, despite apparent similarity to the enteric consensus promoter. The adhB gene was transcribed at low levels in E. coli from the P2 promoter of Z. mobilis but was expressed well in E. coli under control of the lac promoter (approximately 0.25% of the total cell protein).
TI  - Gene expression in Zymomonas mobilis: promoter structure and identification of membrane anchor sequences forming functional lacZ' fusion proteins.
AB  - We have described a procedure for the isolation of lacZ' fusion genes which contain anchor sequences conferring membrane association. This method was used to isolate fragments of DNA from Zymomonas mobilis which contain promoter activity and amino-terminal sequences. The sequences and transcriptional initiation sites of three of these were compared. Both Escherichia coli and Z. mobilis recognized similar regions of DNA for transcriptional initiation. Five to eight consecutive hydrophobic amino acids in the amino terminus served to anchor these hybrid proteins to the membrane in both E. coli and Z. mobilis. General features observed in the Z. mobilis fragments included partial sequence homology with the -35 region sequence of E. coli, repetitive and palindromic A + T-rich regions preceding and adjoining the -10 region, a sequence resembling the consensus sequence of E. coli in the -10 region, and a potential ribosomal-binding site (AGGA) 8 to 12 bases upstream from an in-frame start codon. The level of expression of fusion proteins was generally higher in E. coli than in Z. mobilis. This higher level of expression in E. coli may result from multiple sites of transcriptional initiation and higher plasmid copy number.
TI  - Pyruvate decarboxylase of Zymomonas mobilis: isolation, properties, and genetic expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Pyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.1) from Zymomonas mobilis purified to homogeneity by using dye-ligand and ion-exchange chromatography. Antibodies produced against the enzyme and the amino-terminal sequence obtained for the pure enzyme were used to select and confirm the identity of a genomic clone encoding the enzyme selected from a genomic library of Z. mobilis DNA cloned into pUC9. The genomic fragment encoding the enzyme expressed high levels of pyruvate decarboxylase in Escherichia coli. Possible RNA polymerase and ribosome-binding sites have been identified in the 5'-untranslated region of the pyruvate decarboxylase gene.
TI  - Promoter and nucleotide sequences of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase.
AB  - DNA sequence analysis showed that pyruvate decarboxylase (one of the most abundant proteins in Zymomonas mobilis) contains 559 amino acids. The promoter for the gene encoding pyruvate decarboxylase was not recognized by Escherichia coli, although the cloned gene was expressed at relatively high levels under the control of alternative promoters. The promoter region did not contain sequences which could be identified as being homologous to the generalized promoter structure for E. coli. Hydropathy plots for the amino acid sequence indicated that pyruvate decarboxylase contains a large number of hydrophobic domains which may contribute to the thermal stability of this enzyme.
TI  - Expression Vector for Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - This study describes the construction of several useful cloning vectors which can be conjugated from Escherichia coli into Zymomonas mobilis at high frequency, approaching 10 per donor or recipient. These vectors contain a broad-host-range replicon and mob site from RSF1010, a chloramphenicol acyltransferase gene under the control of an enteric consensus promoter, and a second mob site (originally derived from RP4). The addition of this second mob site appears to be responsible for a 2-order-of-magnitude increase in the efficiency of transfer into Z. mobilis. Such vectors may be useful for other gram-negative bacteria in which conjugation efficiencies are low. These vectors are stably maintained in Z. mobilis with no detectable loss of plasmid after 50 generations in the absence of selective pressure. One of these, pLOI193, contains the tetracycline gene from pBR322 and associated cloning sites for insertional inactivation. Another, pLOI204, contains a Z. mobilis promoter immediately upstream from a BamHI site which can be used for cloning. This promoter has been shown to efficiently drive the expression of beta-galactosidase in both Z. mobilis and E. coli. This promoter fragment from Z. mobilis has been sequenced, and the site for transcriptional initiation in E. coli and Z. mobilis has been identified.
TI  - Expression and stability of a recombinant plasmid in Zymomonas mobilis and Escherichia coli.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid was constructed by ligating EcoRI digests of the plasmid cloning vector pBR325 and pZMO2, one of the natural plasmids of Zymomonas mobilis ATCC 10988. This vector, named pDS212 (total size 7.9 kb), which was able to transform Escherichia coli efficiently, was also transferred to Z. mobilis hosts by mobilization during conjugation using the helper plasmid pRK2013. pDS212 was inherited stably in both E. coli and Z. mobilis hosts and could be recovered intact from them. Markers of pBR325 and pRK2013 were also transferred in Z. mobilis but at very low frequencies. Neither pBR325 nor pRK2013 could be recovered intact from the Z. mobilis hosts. It is proposed that expression and stability of pDS212 in Z. mobilis is due to the origin of replication of pZMO2 that it carries, and that it may be used for developing a gene transfer system in Z. mobilis.
TI  - Construction of a transposon containing a gene for polygalacturonate trans-eliminase from Klebsiella oxytoca.
AB  - A DNA fragment containing a Klebsiella oxytoca gene for polygalacturonate trans-eliminase was cloned into the kanamycin resistance transposon Tn5. This new transposon, designated Tn5-Pga+, had a transposition frequency of 1 X 10(-6). The broad host range plasmid pR751::Tn5-Pga+ was conjugally transferred to a variety of genetic backgrounds. The ability to degrade polygalacturonate was expressed in Aeromonas hydrophila, Alcaligenes eutrophus, Azotomonas insolita, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, but not in Zymomonas mobilis.
TI  - Transfer of Plasmids to an Antibiotic-Sensitive Mutant of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Wild-type strains of Zymomonas mobilis exhibit multiple antibiotic resistance and thus restrict the use of many broad-host-range plasmids in them as cloning vehicles. Antibiotic-sensitive mutants of Z. mobilis were isolated and used as hosts for the conjugal transfer of broad-host-range plasmids from Escherichia coli. Such antibiotic-sensitive strains can facilitate the application of broad-host-range plasmids to the study of Z. mobilis.
TI  - Isolation of Noninhibitory Strains of Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Wild-type Zymomonas mobilis strains inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli. We report the first isolation of noninhibitory strains, called Zymomonas inhibition negative (Zin), after treatment with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. A standardized soft-agar overlay procedure for detecting E. coli growth inhibition was also developed.
TI  - Transformation of Zymomonas mobilis by a hybrid plasmid.
AB  - The transformation of Zymomonas mobilis by plasmid DNA was achieved using a modification of the CaCl2 method for Escherichia coli. The highest frequency of transformation obtained was 5 X 10(3) transformants/micrograms DNA. The success of the method depended upon the use of a plasmid which is a cointegrate between a Z. mobilis cryptic plasmid and an E. coli plasmid carrying two selectable drug resistance markers.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different Zymomonas mobilis strains.
AB  - Twenty different Zymomonas mobilis strains were found to produce a substance which inhibited or killed various other Zymomonas , Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. This antibacterial activity could be detected in cross-streak tests and as zones of clearing in lawns of the test bacteria. When Zymomonas strains are used as recipients in conjugation experiments, their antibacterial activity can be used to advantage for removal of unwanted donor cells from the mating mixtures.
TI  - Self-transmissible plasmid in Zymomonas mobilis carrying antibiotic resistance.
AB  - The cryptic plasmid pRUT41 from Zymomonas mobilis was examined for its biological properties. This plasmid was found to be conjugally transferred from Z. mobilis CP4 to Escherichia coli BM21 and to carry genes for antibiotic resistance (gentamicin, kanamycin, and streptomycin). Covalently closed circular plasmid DNA was isolated from eight transconjugants of E. coli BM21. These plasmids were identical in mobility on agarose gels and exhibited the same restriction patterns as the native pRUT41 plasmid isolated from Z. mobilis. The plasmid location of the antibiotic resistance genes was further confirmed by transforming E. coli BM21 with isolated pRUT41 plasmid from strain CP4 and with plasmids from the transconjugants of BM21. Resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin was tightly linked and transferred together in all cases.
TI  - Expression of a Lactose Transposon (Tn951) in Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - The potential utility of Zymomonas mobilis as an organism for the commercial production of ethanol would be greatly enhanced by the addition of foreign genes which expand its range of fermentable substrates. We tested various plasmids and mobilizing factors for their ability to act as vectors and introduce foreign genes into Z. mobilis CP4. Plasmid pGC91.14, a derivative of RP1, was found to be transferred from Escherichia coli to Z. mobilis at a higher frequency than previously reported for any other plasmids. Both tetracycline resistance and the lactose operon from this plasmid were expressed in Z. mobilis CP4. Plasmid pGC91.14 was stably maintained in Z. mobilis at 30 degrees C but rapidly lost at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Lipid composition of Zymomonas mobilis: effects of ethanol and glucose.
AB  - Zymomonas mobilis is an alcohol-tolerant microorganism which is potentially useful for the commercial production of ethanol. This organism was found to contain cardiolipin, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine as major phospholipids. Vaccenic acid was the most abundant fatty acid, with lesser amounts of myristic, palmitic, and palmitoleic acids. No branched-chain or cyclopropane fatty acids were found. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that ethanol induces the synthesis of phospholipids enriched in vaccenic acid in Escherichia coli (L. O. Ingram, J. Bacteriol. 125:670-678, 1976). The fatty acid composition of Z. mobilis, an obligately ethanol-producing microorganism, represents an extreme of the trend observed in E. coli. In Z. mobilis, vaccenic acid represents over 75% of the acyl chains in the polar membrane lipids. Glucose and ethanol had no major effect on the fatty acid composition of Z. mobilis. However, both glucose and ethanol caused a decrease in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol and an increase in cardiolipin and phosphatidylcholine. Ethanol also caused a dose-dependent reduction in the lipid-to-protein ratios of crude membranes. The lipid composition of Z. mobilis may represent an evolutionary adaptation for survival in the presence of ethanol.
TI  - High-productivity alcohol fermentations using Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - A process is under development at the University of New South Wales to produce fermentation ethanol faster and more efficiently. The process is based on the micro-organism Zymomonas mobilis, which has higher specific rates of ethanol production and higher yields when compared with the traditionally used yeasts. By using hollow fibre membranes for cell recycle, high productivity continuous processes have been studied at laboratory-scale. Pilot scale evaluations (500 litres) are now in progress through Licence Agreements between the University and industry. Genetic manipulation and recombinant DNA techniques are being used to increase the ethanol tolerance and broaden the substrate range. Most recently glucoamylase genes from Aspergillus niger have been cloned into Escherichia coli K12 as part of a programme to enable direct fermentation of starch to ethanol by Z. mobilis.
TI  - R-Plasmid Transfer in Zymomonas mobilis.
AB  - Conjugal transfer of three IncP1 plasmids and one IncFII plasmid into strains of  the ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis was obtained. These plasmids were transferred at high frequencies from Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa into Z. mobilis and also between different Z. mobilis strains, using the membrane filter mating technique. Most of the plasmids were stably maintained in Z. mobilis, although there was some evidence of delayed marker expression. A low level of chromosomal gene transfer, mediated by plasmid R68.45, was detected between Z. mobilis strains. Genetic evidence suggesting that Z. mobilis may be more closely related to E. coli than to Pseudomonas or Rhizobium is discussed.
