TI  == correlation analysis of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli shedding and faecal bacterial composition in beef cattle.
AB  == aims: the objectives of this study were to investigate the correlations between shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) shedding and faecal microflora in beef cattle and to identify functional species that might be used for stec control. methods and results: faecal samples were collected from 110 calves and 92 dams. the number and prevalence of stec were determined using chromagar stec;  denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was employed to analyse faecal bacterial composition. six-month-old calves had the highest stec shedding levels  (3.03 +/- 1.41 log cfu g(-1)) and prevalence (95.5%). both the number and prevalence decreased significantly as the calf age increased (p < 0.05). the dgge analysis showed that faecal bacterial diversity increased, while cattle ages increased and stec shedding levels decreased. significant correlations between stec shedding, cattle age and bacterial compositions were observed by redundancy  analysis (p < 0.05). t-value biplots and sequencing results indicated that butyrate-producing bacteria (bpb) negatively correlated with stec shedding. conclusions: higher stec shedding levels and prevalence were associated with younger cattle age, lower faecal bacterial diversity and lower bpb levels. significance and impact of the study: butyrate-producing bacteria in gi tract might serve as an option for the future development of stec shedding control strategy.

TI  == a diet high in resistant starch modulates microbiota composition, scfa concentrations, and gene expression in pig intestine.
AB  == resistant starch (rs) is highly fermentable by microbiota in the colon, resulting in the production of scfas. rs is thought to mediate a large proportion of its health benefits, including increased satiety, through the actions of scfas. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a diet high in rs on luminal  microbiota composition, luminal scfa concentrations, and the expression of host genes involved in scfa uptake, scfa signaling, and satiety regulation in mucosal  tissue obtained from small intestine, cecum, and colon. twenty adult female pigs  were either assigned to a digestible starch (ds) diet or a diet high in rs (34%)  for a period of 2 wk. after the intervention, luminal content and mucosal scrapings were obtained for detailed molecular analysis. rs was completely degraded in the cecum. in both the cecum and colon, differences in microbiota composition were observed between ds- and rs-fed pigs. in the colon these included the stimulation of the healthy gut-associated butyrate-producing faecalibacterium prausnitzii, whereas potentially pathogenic members of the gammaproteobacteria, including escherichia coli and pseudomonas spp., were reduced in relative abundance. cecal and colonic scfa concentrations were significantly greater in rs-fed pigs, and cecal gene expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (slc16a1) and glucagon (gcg) was induced by rs. in  conclusion, our data show that rs modulates microbiota composition, scfa concentrations, and host gene expression in pig intestine. combined, our data provide an enhanced understanding of the interaction between diet, microbiota, and host.

TI  == transfer of intestinal microbiota from lean donors increases insulin sensitivity  in individuals with metabolic syndrome.
AB  == alterations in intestinal microbiota are associated with obesity and insulin resistance. we studied the effects of infusing intestinal microbiota from lean donors to male recipients with metabolic syndrome on the recipients' microbiota composition and glucose metabolism. subjects were assigned randomly to groups that were given small intestinal infusions of allogenic or autologous microbiota. six weeks after infusion of microbiota from lean donors, insulin sensitivity of recipients increased (median rate of glucose disappearance changed from 26.2 to 45.3 mumol/kg/min; p < .05) along with levels of butyrate-producing intestinal microbiota. intestinal microbiota might be developed as therapeutic agents to increase insulin sensitivity in humans; www.trialregister.nl; registered at the dutch trial register (ntr1776).

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.

TI  == e durans strain m4-5 isolated from human colonic flora attenuates intestinal inflammation.
AB  == purpose: the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo effects of a  unique high-butyrate-producing bacterial strain from human colonic flora, enterococcus durans, in prevention and treatment of intestinal inflammation. methods: a compartmentalized caco-2/leukocyte coculture model was used to examine the in vitro effects of e durans and its metabolite butyrate on basal and escherichia coli-stimulated secretion of proinflammatory immune factors (il-8, il-6, and tnf-alpha) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10. a murine model of  dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis was used to examine in vivo effects of prevention and therapy with e durans on clinical, biochemical, and histologic parameters of inflammation. results: in the coculture model, treatment with e durans and with butyrate reduced basal as well as e coli stimulated secretion of  il-8, il-6, and tnf-alpha and increased secretion of il-10. in the in vivo murine model, preventive administration of e durans significantly ameliorated clinical disease activity index (weight loss, fecal bleeding, and stool consistency), reduced myeloperoxidase concentration in colon tissue extracts, improved histologic scores of colonic inflammation, and inhibited colonic transcription of proinflammatory immune factors. the effect of therapeutic treatment alone on these parameters was more moderate but still significant. conclusions: we conclude that e durans strain m4 to 5 and its metabolic product butyrate induce significant anti-inflammatory effects, mediated by regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory immune factors as well as preservation of intestine epithelial  integrity, suggesting that this novel anti-inflammatory bacterium may be preferentially a useful prophylactic treatment to avoid inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == enhanced translocation of bacteria across metabolically stressed epithelia is reduced by butyrate.
AB  == background: the gut microflora in some patients with crohn's disease can be reduced in numbers of butyrate-producing bacteria and this could result in metabolic stress in the colonocytes. thus, we hypothesized that the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, is important in the maintenance and regulation of the barrier function of the colonic epithelium. methods: confluent monolayers of the  human colon-derived t84 or ht-29 epithelial cell lines were exposed to dinitrophenol (dnp (0.1 mm), uncouples oxidative phosphorylation) + escherichia coli (strain hb101, 10(6) cfu) +/- butyrate (3-50 mm). transepithelial resistance (ter), and bacterial internalization and translocation were assessed over a 24-hour period. epithelial ultrastructure was assessed by transmission electron microscopy. results: epithelia under metabolic stress display decreased ter and increased numbers of pseudopodia that is consistent with increased internalization and translocation of the e. coli. butyrate (but not acetate) significantly reduced the bacterial translocation across dnp-treated epithelia but did not ameliorate the drop in ter in the dnp+e. coli exposed monolayers. inhibition of bacterial transcytosis across metabolically stressed epithelia was  associated with reduced i-kappab phosphorylation and hence nf-kappab activation.  conclusions: reduced butyrate-producing bacteria could result in increased epithelial permeability particularly in the context of concomitant exposure to another stimulus that reduces mitochondria function. we speculate that prebiotics, the substrate for butyrate synthesis, is a valuable prophylaxis in the regulation of epithelial permeability and could be of benefit in preventing relapses in ibd.

TI  == the role of ph in determining the species composition of the human colonic microbiota.
AB  == the ph of the colonic lumen varies with anatomical site and microbial fermentation of dietary residue. we have investigated the impact of mildly acidic ph, which occurs in the proximal colon, on the growth of different species of human colonic bacteria in pure culture and in the complete microbial community. growth was determined for 33 representative human colonic bacteria at three initial ph values (approximately 5.5, 6.2 and 6.7) in anaerobic ycfa medium, which includes a mixture of short-chain fatty acids (scfa) with 0.2% glucose as energy source. representatives of all eight bacteroides species tested grew poorly at ph 5.5, as did escherichia coli, whereas 19 of the 23 gram-positive anaerobes tested gave growth rates at ph 5.5 that were at least 50% of those at ph 6.7. growth inhibition of b. thetaiotaomicron at ph 5.5 was increased by the presence of the scfa mix (33 mm acetate, 9 mm propionate and 1 mm each of iso-valerate, valerate and iso-butyrate). analysis of amplified 16s rrna sequences demonstrated a major ph-driven shift within a human faecal bacterial community in a continuous flow fermentor. bacteroides spp. accounted for 27% of 16s rrna sequences detected at ph 5.5, but 86% of sequences at ph 6.7. conversely, butyrate-producing gram-positive bacteria related to eubacterium rectale represented 50% of all 16s rrna sequences at ph 5.5, but were not detected at ph 6.7. inhibition of the growth of a major group of gram-negative bacteria at mildly acidic ph apparently creates niches that can be exploited by more low ph-tolerant microorganisms.

TI  == effect of dietary protein level on growth performance, indicators of enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs induced with postweaning colibacillosis.
AB  == the effect of dietary cp level on performance, enteric health, and gastrointestinal microbial ecology of weaned pigs challenged with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) k88 was investigated in a 14-d study. forty weaned pigs (bw = 5.32 +/- 0.24 kg, mean +/- sd), housed 4 per pen, were randomly assigned to 2 diets (5 pens/diet): 1) 22.5% cp or 2) 17.6% cp supplemented with aa. diets contained the same amount of me and standardized ileal digestible lys, met + cys, thr, and trp based on the ideal protein ratio. isoleucine and val were added to the 17.6% cp diet up to the level in the 22.5% cp diet. on d 8 postweaning, pigs  were challenged with 6 ml of etec suspension (10(10) cfu/ml) by gavage. feed disappearance and bw were measured on d 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14 for determination of adg, adfi, and g:f. one pig from each pen was serially slaughtered on -1, 3, and  7 d postchallenge (10 pigs/d of slaughter) to evaluate gut morphology, and gut microbial ecology and metabolites. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) adg and g:f than those fed the 17.6% cp diet before infection, but performance was similar between the 2 diets after etec challenge and overall. on  d 3 after challenge, etec was not detected in the ileal digesta of pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet but was detected in the ileal digesta of 80% of pigs fed the 22.5%  cp diet (5.22 +/- 1.07 cfu/g, mean +/- sd). pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet had a greater (p < 0.01) prevalence of order clostridiales (73 vs. 50%), family lachnospiraceae (43 vs. 18%), and genus roseburia (13 vs. 3%) in the colon digesta 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 22.5% cp diet. the richness and diversity of bacteria in the colon digesta were less (p < 0.05) in pigs fed the 17.6% cp diet than in those fed the 22.5% cp diet at -1, 3, and 7 d  postchallenge. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had greater (p < 0.05) ammonia n concentration in the colon digesta on -1 and 7 d after challenge compared with those fed the 17.6% cp diet. pigs fed the 22.5% cp diet had deeper (p < 0.05) crypts 1 d before challenge, shorter villi 3 d after challenge, and reduced villus height:crypt depth 1 d before and 3 d after challenge compared with those  fed the 17.6% cp diet. in conclusion, a reduction in the dietary cp level of weaned pigs from 22.5 to 17.6% with aa supplementation impaired growth performance before, but not after, the etec challenge and increased the relative  composition of butyrate producing bacteria in the colon digesta after etec challenge.

TI  == a novel class of coa-transferase involved in short-chain fatty acid metabolism in butyrate-producing human colonic bacteria.
AB  == bacterial butyryl-coa coa-transferase activity plays a key role in butyrate formation in the human colon, but the enzyme and corresponding gene responsible for this activity have not previously been identified. a novel coa-transferase gene is described from the colonic bacterium roseburia sp. a2-183, with similarity to acetyl-coa hydrolase as well as 4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferase sequences. the gene product, overexpressed in an escherichia coli lysate, showed  activity with butyryl-coa and to a lesser degree propionyl-coa in the presence of acetate. butyrate, propionate, isobutyrate and valerate competed with acetate as  the co-substrate. despite the sequence similarity to 4-hydroxybutyrate coa-transferases, 4-hydroxybutyrate did not compete with acetate as the co-substrate. thus the coa-transferase preferentially uses butyryl-coa as substrate. similar genes were identified in other butyrate-producing human gut bacteria from clostridial clusters iv and xiva, while other candidate coa-transferases for butyrate formation could not be detected in roseburia sp. a2-183. this suggests strongly that the newly identified group of coa-transferases described here plays a key role in butyrate formation in the human colon.
