TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == yoghurts containing probiotics reduce disruption of the small intestinal barrier  in methotrexate-treated rats.
AB  == small intestinal permeability was employed to assess the efficacy of commercially available yoghurts containing probiotics in a rat model of methotrexate (mtx)-induced mucositis. male sprague-dawley rats were allocated to four groups (n = 8): mtx + water, mtx + cow's milk yoghurt (cy; fermented with lactobacillus  johnsonii), mtx + sheep's milk yoghurt (sy; containing lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus), and saline. treatment gavage occurred twice daily for 7 days pre-mtx and 5 days post-mtx. intestinal permeability was assessed on days -7, -1, 2, and 5 of the trial. intestinal sections were collected at sacrifice for histological and biochemical analyses. histology revealed that rats receiving cy and sy did not have a significantly damaged duodenum compared to controls. however, an improved small intestinal barrier function was evident, determined by a decreased lactulose/mannitol ratio. probiotics containing sy and cy may be useful in preventing disruption to intestinal barrier function in mtx-induced mucositis.

TI  == bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk using pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). most of the identified bacterial species in zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (lab), e.g., streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus johnsonii. using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. the main dominant species was st. thermophilus followed by lc. garvieae. other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific pcr assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the ttge and dgge results. lc. garvieae, lc. raffinolactis, ln. citreum,  and lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of egyptian fermented milk.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

TI  == molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == real-time quantitative pcr assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (lab) (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. the results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to s. thermophilus and the species of the l. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that dna extraction was efficient and that genomic dna solutions were free of pcr inhibitors. for l. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of pcr quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees c for most of the strains in  this species. real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == the prophages of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533: comparative genomics and transcription analysis.
AB  == two non-inducible, but apparently complete prophages were identified in the genome of the sequenced lactobacillus johnsonii strain ncc 533. the 38- and 40-kb-long prophages lj928 and lj965 represent distinct lineages of sfi11-like pac-site siphoviridae unrelated at the dna sequence level. the deduced structural proteins from lj928 demonstrated aa sequence identity with lactococcus lactis phage tp901-1, while lj965 shared sequence links with streptococcus thermophilus  phage o1205. with the exception of trna genes, inserted between dna replication and dna packaging genes, the transcription of the prophage was restricted to the  genome segments near both attachment sites. transcribed genes unrelated to phage  functions were inserted between the phage repressor and integrase genes; one group of genes shared sequence relatedness with a mobile dna element in staphylococcus aureus. a short, but highly transcribed region was located between the phage lysin and right attachment site; it lacked a protein-encoding function  in one prophage.

TI  == modulation of nonspecific mechanisms of defense by lactic acid bacteria: effective dose.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (formerly known as lactobacillus acidophilus la1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. the first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (group a) alone or s. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 (group b). group c received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained s. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1. ingestion of l. johnsonii la1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. however, l. johnsonii la1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from  the feces of the volunteers of groups b and c. the fermented base alone showed a  weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. however, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 significantly enhanced both functions. the product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1 had no significant effect on either function. these results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.
