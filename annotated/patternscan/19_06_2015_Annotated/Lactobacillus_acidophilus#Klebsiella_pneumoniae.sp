TI  == abcb1 (p-glycoprotein) reduces bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal ls174t epithelial cells.
AB  == the aim of this project was to show elevated p-glycoprotein (p-gp) expression decreasing bacterial association with ls174t human gastrointestinal cells, and that this effect could be reversed upon blocking functional p-gp efflux. staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lactobacillus acidophilus and numerous strains of escherichia coli, from commensal to enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic strains (o157:h7) were fluorescently labelled and incubated on ls174t cultures either with or without p-gp amplification using rifampicin. psc-833 was used as a potent functional p-gp blocking agent. staphylococcus and pseudomonas displayed the greatest association with the ls174t cells. surprisingly, lactobacilli retained more fluorescence than enteropathogenic-e. coli in this system. irrespective of attachment differences between the bacterial species, the increase in p-gp protein expression decreased  bacterial fluorescence by 25-30%. this included the gfp-labelled e. coli, and enterohaemorrhagic e. coli (o157:h7). blocking p-gp function through the co-administration of psc-833 increased the amount of bacteria associated with p-gp expressing ls174t cells back to control levels. as most bacteria were affected to the same degree, irrespective of pathogenicity, it is unlikely that p-gp has a direct influence on adhesion of bacteria, and instead p-gp may be playing an indirect role by secreting a bank of endogenous factors or changing the local environment to one less suited to bacterial growth in general.

TI  == effect of a synbiotic on microbial community structure in a continuous culture model of the gastric microbiota in enteral nutrition patients.
AB  == patients with dysphagia require long-term nutritional support. this can be delivered by the enteral route via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg) tube. enteral nutrition (en) bypasses the body's innate defences that prevent the microbial colonization of the proximal gut, which predisposes to microbial overgrowth. a continuous culture model simulating the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota of en patients was used to investigate the effects of a synbiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus dun-311, bifidobacterium bifidum bb-02, bifidobacterium lactis bl-01, synergy 1) on microbial community structure and metabolism. a peg tube was inserted into the fermenters to study biofilm formation. the synbiotic delivered in sterile semi-skimmed milk (sssm) was introduced either 48 h prior to or after peg tube insertion. the synbiotic reduced biofilm formation on peg tube surfaces, with suppression of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae when it was added subsequent to peg insertion. when synbiotic feeding was commenced prior to peg insertion, colonization by staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and candida famata was also inhibited. lactate production increased in response the synbiotic or control (sssm). these results indicate that the use of a synbiotic has the potential to reduce pathogen colonization on peg tube surfaces in vivo, thereby reducing the incidence of biofilm-related infectious complications.

TI  == [antagonistic effect of bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus acidophilus on klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and proteus mirabilis cells].
AB  == data of the ultrastructural cellular changes of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, including k. pneumoniae, c. freundii and p. mirabilis cells impacts to bacteriocin-producing l. acidophilus are presented. enterobacteria in  response to the bacteriocinogenic effect of lactobacilli are manifestated by expressive destructions of sensitive to pore formation bacteriocin cells. various morphological types of enterobacteria cells with increase of involution, lysing and resting forms are revealed. the specific ultrastructural changes of enterobacteria cells which evidencing the significant destructive processes of the cells membranes are detected. the destabilization of cellular wall in expansion periplasmic spaces and appearance of the ultrastructural reorganization of bacterial cells nucleoid also are registrated. revealing the mechanism of lactobacilli secreted bacteriocin action to conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria might provide new ways to select the effective highly antagonistic probiotic strains.

TI  == cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses stimulated in volunteers by an oral polybacterial immunomodulator "dentavax".
AB  == the oral polybacterial immunomodulator dentavax (d), composed of killed cells from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates was created for  immunoprophylaxis and therapy of oral mucosa and parodont inflammations. the stimulating effect of the preparation was evaluated in twelve volunteers immunized for 10 consecutive days. on days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 49 after the last immunization peripheral blood (pb) lymphocyte subsets, t lymphocyte activation and pb phagocytic activity, were studied by flow cytometry. pb lymphocyte proliferative responses to pha, ril-2, lps and d were evaluated radiometrically.  the production of tnf-alpha in supernatants of in vitro stimulated lymphocytes and specific iga, igm and igg antibodies in serum and saliva was determined by elisa. ultrastructural morphologic changes in t and b lymphocyte populations were also investigated. although no significant changes in the levels of basic lymphocyte subsets were detected, the early/late (cd57+/cd57-) cd8 t effectors ratio was increased at the end of the studied period, as were the percentage of pha-responding (cd69+) t cells and pb phagocytizing cells. the most prominent lymphoprolipherative responses were measured upon costimulation with lps+d and pha+d on day 21. electron-microscopic studies demonstrated a significant effect of d on both t and b cell activity. tnf-alpha concentration increased progressively from day 7 till the end of the investigation. maximal concentrations were observed after stimulation with d and lps. an increased level of specific salivary and serum antibodies against the components of d was found,  with highest levels between days 7 and 21. specific secretory iga predominated in saliva as compared to igm and igg. our results demonstrate the stimulating effect of dentavax on pb lymphocyte functional activity and the specific humoral systemic and mucosal immunity.

TI  == microbiological quality of sous and tamarind, traditional drinks consumed in jordan.
AB  == this study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality of sous (a drink prepared by extracting dried roots of glycyrrhiza glabra) and tamarind (a drink prepared by infusing tamarindus indica dried pulp), traditional drinks consumed in jordan. twenty-one samples of sous and 44 samples of tamarind were collected from the local market in amman, jordan. water is the major component of the drinks. sous drink is characterized by having an alkaline ph (range, 6.6 to 9.9;  mean, 8.6), whereas tamarind drink has an acidic ph (range, 1.8 to 3.7; mean, 2.8). the drinks are not processed for safety before serving, and at some vendors drinks are not properly refrigerated. the mean counts for aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts in sous drink samples were 5.9, 5.0, and 3.8 log cfu/ml, respectively; those in tamarind drink samples were 4.0, <1, and 5.8 log cfu/ml, respectively. the lactic acid bacteria isolated were enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus buchneri. the yeast isolates in sous drink were from the genera candida, filobasidium, hanseniaspora, lodderomyces, pichia, and williopsis, and those in tamarind drink were from arthroascus, brettanomyces, candida, debaromyces, filobasidiella, hanseniaspora, klavispora, lodderomyces, pichia, saccharomycodes, trichosporon, and zygosaccharomyces. enterobacteriaceae were detected in two sous samples and were identified as enterobacter sakazakii and erwinia sp., and in two tamarind samples and were identified as citrobacter freundii and klebsiella pneumoniae. salmonella was detected in one sous and one tamarind sample. pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in only one sous sample. these findings highlight the importance of application of hygienic practices throughout preparation and vending of drinks, starting with raw ingredients and continuing through preparation, storage, display, and serving.

TI  == [search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  == for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a  complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.

TI  == immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator 'dentavax' in a rabbit experimental model.
AB  == the immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, dentavax (d), composed of killed cells from klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. in this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. a long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. the influence of orally given dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. a two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. in immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, igg) and coproantibodies (predominantly, s-iga) determined  by elisa, has been found. the results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation d, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.

TI  == interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  == the ability of the lactobacillus acidophilus rc14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. a parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis. although the initial deposition rates of the two candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.

TI  == the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected  by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.

TI  == antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
AB  == the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed  as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.

TI  == [protective effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on development of infection, caused by klebsiella pneumoniae].
AB  == the mechanisms of protective action of lactobacillus have been studied during development of the generalized infection induced by klebsiella pneumoniae in cba  mice after weaning. the mice were infected intragastrically during the first day  after weaning (1 x 10(9) bacterias per mice). suspensions of lactobacillus were introduced before and after infection during 10 days (1 x 10(6) bacterias per mice). it has been shown that introduction of lactobacillus substantially decreased the level of the gut contamination by klebsiella, prevented generalization of infection and death of animals. significant higher levels of iga in the blood serum, iga and igm in the gut content, percentage of splenocytes, expressing surface igm and igg were observed on the 7th day as compared with those in animals without lactobacillus. significantly lower percentage of splenocytes, expressing cd4 antigen was also observed. on the 11th  day after infection the mice receiving lactobacillus have shown a tendency to an  increase of iga in the gut content, significantly lower concentrations of igm in  the gut content and a higher level of iga to the blood serum as compared with the control. other characteristics were comparable to those of the control group. a conclusion is made that introduction of lactobacillus prevents development of the klebsiella infection and protects the immune system from excessive antigenic action.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a salmonella plasmid cloned in  escherichia coli k12.
AB  == the sucrose operon from pur400, a 78-kbp conjugative salmonella plasmid, was cloned in escherichia coli k12. the operon was located in a 5.7-kbp sali restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector puc18. the insert dna was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease bal31. cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. the scra (enzyme iiscr) and scrr (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp smai-sali dna fragment and were assigned the order scrb, scra, scrr. an amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. this protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 m sodium chloride, 2% triton x-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. the protein did not appear to be the product of either the scra, scrb, or scrr gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. a new gene, scrc, is proposed. in addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp sali and 2.5-kbp smai-sali dna fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal dna from bacillus subtilis, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to dna from a sucrose plasmid from salmonella tennessee. however, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp ecori restriction fragment from klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == the formation of germtubes by candida albicans, when grown with staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacilius acidophilus and proteus vulgaris.
AB  == the formation of germtubes by twelve clinical isolates of c. albicans was studied in human serum containing per millilitre 10(3) to 10(9) organisms as: staphylococcus pyegene, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, lactobacillus acidophilus and proteus vulgaris. all the five bacteria inhibited formation of germtubes by c. albicans at all concentrations and the percent germtube formed diminished with increasing concentration of the bacteria. lactobacillus acidophilus inhibited the formation of germtubes maximally followed by staphylococcus pyogene, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. proteus vulgaris in the concentrations of 10(3) to 10(7) bacteria per millilitre produced only insignificant inhibition of formation of germtubes by c. albicans. since germtubes of c. albicans are invasive, it is suggested that inhibition of "blastospore-germtube transformation" may be significantly responsible for prevention of infection by c. albicans by coexisting bacterial flora.

TI  == enterotoxigenic intestinal bacteria in tropical sprue. iv. effect of linoleic acid on growth interrelationships of lactobacillus acidophilus and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == the factors responsible for colonization of the small intestine by enterotoxigenic coliform bacteria in puerto ricans with tropical sprue are unknown, but epidemiological observations have suggested that they may be related to an increased dietary intake of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, particularly linoleic acid, which is known to exert an inhibitory effect on the growth of gram-positive organisms that normally comprise the flora of the small intestine. we have examined, by using a glucose-limited continuous-culture system, what effect this fatty acid exerts on the growth relationships of enteric gram-positive and coliform bacteria. in this system, colonization by an invading  strain of klebsiella pneumoniae was prevented by the presence of an established culture of lactobacillus acidophilus, principally by virtue of a lowered ph of the medium that was incompatible with klebsiella growth. however, when the population density of l. acidophilus was reduced by the presence of a sufficient  concentration of linoleic acid, the invading k. pneumoniae successfully colonized the system and, once established, suppressed the growth of l. acidophilus. these  observations indicate that, under the conditions of our chemostat, gram-positive  enteric bacteria suppress coliform growth and that this effect is reversible by the presence of linoleic acid. it remains to be established, however, what pertinence these in vitro observations have to conditions within the intestinal tract of persons living in the tropics.
