TI  == tetracycline resistance and tetm in oral anaerobic bacteria and neisseria perflava-n. sicca.
AB  == tetracycline-resistant organisms isolated from six patients with periodontal disease included bacteroides spp., eubacterium spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria perflava-n. sicca, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, veillonella parvula,  and facultative streptococci. all but the bacteroides spp. and eubacterium spp. hybridized with the tetm determinant. an additional 417 bacterial strains were screened, and 4% of both the oral streptococci and the fusobacterium spp. hybridized with the tetm probe.
