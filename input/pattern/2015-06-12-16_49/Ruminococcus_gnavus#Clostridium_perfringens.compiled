TI  - Characterization and distribution of the gene cluster encoding RumC, an anti-Clostridium perfringens bacteriocin produced in the gut.
AB  - Ruminococcin C (RumC) is a trypsin-dependent bacteriocin produced by Ruminococcus gnavus E1, a gram-positive strict anaerobic strain isolated from human feces. It consists of at least three similar peptides active against Clostridium perfringens. In this article, a 15-kb region from R. gnavus E1 chromosome, containing the biosynthetic gene cluster of RumC was characterized. It harbored 17 open reading frames (called rum(c) genes) with predicted functions in bacteriocin biosynthesis and post-translational modification, signal transduction regulation, and immunity. An unusual feature of the locus is the presence of five genes encoding highly homologous, but nonidentical RumC precursors. The transcription levels of the rum(c) genes were quantified. The rumC genes were found to be highly expressed in vivo, when R. gnavus E1 colonized the digestive tract of mono-contaminated rats, whereas the amount of corresponding transcripts was below detection level when it grew in liquid culture medium. Moreover, the rumC-like genes were disseminated among 10 strains (R. gnavus or related species) previously isolated from human fecal samples and selected for their capability to produce a trypsin-dependant anti-C. perfringens compound. All harbored at least a rumC1-like copy, four exhibited rumC1-5 genes identical to those of strain E1.
TI  - Ruminococcin C, a new anti-Clostridium perfringens bacteriocin produced in the gut by the commensal bacterium Ruminococcus gnavus E1.
AB  - When colonizing the digestive tract of mono-associated rats, Ruminococcus gnavus  E1 - a bacterium isolated from human faeces - produced a trypsin-dependent anti-Clostridium perfringens substance collectively named Ruminococcin C (RumC). RumC was isolated from the caecal contents of E1-monocontaminated rats and found to consist of two antimicrobial fractions: a single peptide (RumCsp) of 4235 Da, and a mixture of two other peptides (RumCdp) with distinct molecular masses of 4324 Da and 4456 Da. Both RumCsp and RumCdp were as effective as metronidazole in combating C. perfringens and their activity spectra against different pathogens were established. Even if devoid of synergistic activity, the combination of RumCsp and RumCdp was observed to be much more resistant to acidic pH and high temperature than each fraction tested individually. N-terminal sequence analysis showed that the primary structures of these three peptides shared a high degree of homology, but were clearly distinct from previously reported amino acid sequences. Amino acid composition of the three RumC peptides did not highlight the presence of any Lanthionine residue. However, Edman degradation could not run beyond the 11th amino acid residue. Five genes encoding putative pre-RumC-like peptides were identified in the genome of strain E1, confirming that RumC was a bacteriocin. This is the first time that a bacteriocin produced in vivo by a human commensal bacterium was purified and characterized.
TI  - Production of an antibacterial substance in the digestive tract involved in colonization-resistance against Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - Ruminococcus gnavus E1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron LEMF4, Clostridium hathewayi LEMC7, and Clostridium orbiscindens LEMH9 were isolated from ex germ-free mice inoculated with a human faecal microbiota. When initially germ-free mice who were previously inoculated with the strain E1 alone, or a four-strain consortium [E1, LEMF4, LEMC7, and LEMH9], were then challenged with 10(8) counts of Clostridium perfringens; the target strain was rapidly eliminated from the digestive tract of the animals (<10(2) cfu g(-)(1) of faeces). R. gnavus E1 was able to produce a diffusible anti-C. perfringens substance that accumulated in the faeces of monoassociated animals, but failed to be detected in the faeces of mice associated with the four-strain consortium. The capability to produce the antibacterial substance was transferred in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice to a Dorea longicatena strain. Further experiments realized with the D. longicatena wild type strain and the transconjugant support the assumption that the diffusible antibacterial substance was necessary for obtaining the antagonistic effect against C. perfringens, but that it acted as a precursor in the mechanism of interaction of the four-strain consortia.
TI  - Genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, Ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  - beta-Glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from Ruminococcus gnavus E1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-Glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp DNA fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from R. gnavus E1 was determined. Five ORFs were detected on this fragment: three complete ORFs (ORF2, gus and ORF3) and two partial ORFs (ORF4 and ORF5). The products of ORF2 and ORF3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (PTSs), such as Escherichia coli BglC, Bacillus subtilis BglP and Bacillus halodurans PTS Enzyme II. The product of ORF5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of Clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bglA). The gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of Lactobacillus gasseri (69%), E. coli (61%), Clostridium perfringens (59%) and Staphylococcus aureus (58%). By complementing an E. coli strain in which the uidA gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the R. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. Moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes ORF2, ORF3 and ORF5.
TI  - Distribution of genes encoding the trypsin-dependent lantibiotic ruminococcin A among bacteria isolated from human fecal microbiota.
AB  - Fourteen bacterial strains capable of producing a trypsin-dependent antimicrobial substance active against Clostridium perfringens were isolated from human fecal samples of various origins (from healthy adults and children, as well as from adults with chronic pouchitis). Identification of these strains showed that they belonged to Ruminococcus gnavus, Clostridium nexile, and Ruminococcus hansenii species or to new operational taxonomic units, all from the Clostridium coccoides phylogenetic group. In hybridization experiments with a probe specific for the structural gene encoding the trypsin-dependent lantibiotic ruminococcin A (RumA) produced by R. gnavus, seven strains gave a positive response. All of them harbored three highly conserved copies of rumA-like genes. The deduced peptide sequence was identical to or showed one amino acid difference from the hypothetical precursor of RumA. Our results indicate that the rumA-like genes have been disseminated among R. gnavus and phylogenetically related strains that can make up a significant part of the human fecal microbiota.
