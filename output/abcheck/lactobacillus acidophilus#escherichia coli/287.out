cloning and expression of the heterodimeric deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine  kinase of lactobacillus acidophilus r-26.
two uniquely paired deoxynucleoside kinases, deoxycytidine kinase/deoxyadenosine  kinase (dck/dak) and deoxyguanosine kinase/deoxyadenosine kinase (dgk/dak) are required, together with thymidine kinase (tk), for deoxynucleotide synthesis in lactobacillus acidophilus r-26.
using polymerase chain reaction-generated probes based on n-terminal amino acid sequences, we have cloned tandem genes for 25- and 26-kda polypeptides, whose derived amino acid sequences and size correspond to wild-type lactobacillus enzyme subunits.
expression in escherichia coli uses a single endogenous promoter and yields active dgk/dak (approximately 3% of extracted protein) closely resembling wild-type dgk/dak in specificity, kinetics, heterotropic activation, and end product inhibition.
alignment of cloned genes reveals 65% identity in their dna sequences and 61% identity in derived amino acid sequences.
comparison with herpes-viral tks reveals three conserved regions: glycine- and arginine-rich atp-binding motifs and a d/e-r-s/h motif at the putative tk deoxynucleoside site.
greater homology, however, is seen upon multiple alignment of dgk with mammalian deoxycytidine kinases, yielding the consensus sequence-d/e-r-s-i/v-y-x-d-.dgk also shares a sequence (-y-d-p-t-i/l-e-d-s/y-y-) required for gtp hydrolysis by p21ras.
