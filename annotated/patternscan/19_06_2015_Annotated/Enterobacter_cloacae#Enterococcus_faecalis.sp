TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == in vitro spectrum of pexiganan activity when tested against pathogens from diabetic foot infections and with selected resistance mechanisms.
AB  == pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid synthetic cationic peptide, is currently in phase 3 clinical trials as a topical antimicrobial agent for the treatment of mild infections associated with diabetic foot ulcers. bacterial isolates from the 2013 sentry antimicrobial surveillance program designated as pathogens from diabetic foot infections (dfi) and gram-negative and -positive pathogens from various infection types that harbored selected resistance mechanisms/phenotypes were tested against pexiganan in reference cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. the mic50 and mic90 against all organisms tested from dfi were 16 and 32 mug/ml, respectively. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter koseri, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa mic values ranged from 8 to 16 mug/ml. pexiganan mic values among staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] and methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa]), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecium ranged from 8 to 32 mug/ml. pexiganan activity was not adversely affected for members of the  family enterobacteriaceae or p. aeruginosa that produced beta-lactamases or resistance mechanisms to other commonly used antimicrobial agents. decreased susceptibility to vancomycin did not affect pexiganan activity against s. aureus  or e. faecium. enterococcus faecalis appears to be intrinsically less susceptible to pexiganan (mic, 32 to 256 mug/ml). the "all organism" mic90 of 32 mug/ml for pexiganan in this study was >250-fold below the pexiganan concentration in the cream/delivery vehicle being developed for topical use.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. clinical non-duplicate isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and three species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their mics of tigecycline alone and in combination with ppis (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. with one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of ppis on tigecycline activity. the mic changes after ppis addition correlated with the  ppis concentrations in the test media. compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. the time-kill study confirmed that the addition of ppis could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. even at low concentration (5 mg/l) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in e. cloacae  and e. faecalis strains. we conclude that in vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of ppis in a concentration-dependent manner.

TI  == bi-directional-bi-dimensionality alignment of self-supporting mn3o4 nanorod and nanotube arrays with different bacteriostasis and magnetism.
AB  == self-supported mn3o4 patterns of aligned nanorods and nanotubes were synthesized  through a bi-directional-bi-dimensionality growth model by using sodium gluconate and urea as additives under mild hydrothermal conditions without the use of any substrates. in one direction, mn3o4 grows to form one-dimensional nanorods or nanotubes, while in the other direction mn3o4 grows into two-dimensional nanoplates to support the nanorods or nanotubes to align into arrays. these two kinds of new nanostructures, a nanotube pattern and a nanorod pattern, show similar and good bacteriostasis for gram positive bacteria, but for gram negative bacteria the nanotube pattern shows much better bacterial restraint than the nanorod pattern. magnetic studies show that the nanorod arrays display similar magnetic properties to the commercial mn3o4, while the nanotube arrays show different ferromagnetic behaviors with enhanced remnant magnetization and saturation magnetization (ms) at low temperature.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and sar study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  == a series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. they were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida krusei, and candida albicans. in this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan  spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface  active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). then, we present a sar study for staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the dominance-based rough set approach (drsa), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. the sar study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial  activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.

TI  == [analysis of resistance tendency of bloodstream-infecting pathogens in china].
AB  == objective: to investigate the resistance profiles and the trend of bloodstream-infecting pathogens isolated from hospitalized patients during 2004-2010. methods: the bloodstream isolates were collected from 18 hospitals in  17 cities. minimum inhibition concentrations (mic) were determined using the agar dilution method recommended by clsi (clinical and laboratory standards institute), and susceptibility results were analyzed according to the 2011 clsi guideline. results: among the 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 periods, the proportions of clinical isolates were similar; 43.1% (149 isolates), 34.0% (151 isolates) and 47.5% (776 isolates) for gram positive strains, 56.9% (197 isolates), 66.0% (293 isolates) and 52.5% (858 isolates) for gram negative strains, respectively. the isolating rate of mrsa was 54.1% (20/37) in 2007-2008, which was the highest among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010, while it decreased in 2009-2010 (36.5%, 62/170). the mrcns proportions were similar across the 3 periods. one (1.8%) vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and 1 linezolid-resistant enterococcus faecalis were found. although the isolating rates of penicillin non-sensitive strains (oral) were similar between 2009-2010 and 2007-2008 [54.5% (6/11) and 53.9% (7/13), respectively], the resistant rates  increased from 0% in 2007-2008 to 30.8% (4/13) in 2009-2010. the results were similar according to the non-meningitis criterion (iv), and the susceptibility rates decreased from 100.0% (11 isolates) in 2007-2008 to 84.6% (11/13) in 2009-2010. esbl-harboring strains in e. coli were similar among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010 [66.7% (30/45), 73.2% (71/97) and 67.9% (233/343), respectively]. esbl-producing strains in klebsilla pnuemoniae decreased year after year, 72.4% (21/29), 50.0% (18/36) and 41.1% (65/158) in 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively. except that the sensitive rate of enterobacter cloacae to ertapenem was 80% (32/40), the sensitive rates of other strains to carbapenems were still above 90% and the resistance rates were less than 5%. acinetobacter baumannii had the highest multi-drug resistance rate (81.8%, 81/99). one strain (1.0%, 1/99) of acinetobacter baumannii isolated in 2009-2010 was reported to be pan-resistant. conclusions: we are facing a more serious situation of bacterial resistance. acinetobacter baumannii resistance was most serious, usually with the characteristics of multiple drug resistance, and even pan-resistance. carbapenems remain to be the most effective against enterobacteriaceae. strains resistant to novel antibiotics (linezolid and tigecycline) have emerged.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

TI  == bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  == purpose: cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (bsis). most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. we here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in bsis in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. methods: we analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between january 2005 and january 2011. results: a total of 4,918 episodes of bsi  occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). in both patient groups, gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). amongst gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. amongst gram-negative organisms, escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following bsi compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. conclusion: these data demonstrate distinct bsi pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == the variability of bacterial aerosol in poultry houses depending on selected factors.
AB  == objectives: this study is aimed at evaluation of bacterial air contamination in intensive poultry breeding. the evaluation was based on the determined levels of  bacterial concentrations and qualitative identification of isolated microorganisms. materials and methods: the study covered 5 poultry houses: two hatcheries and three hen houses with the litter bed system. the air was sampled in three measurement series in the central part of the investigated workplace at  the height of about 1.5 m over the ground, using portable measuring sets consisting of a gilair 5 (sensidyne, usa) pump and a measuring head filled with a glass microfibre filter (whatman, uk). for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of microorganisms were used appropriate microbiological media. results:  the total concentrations of airborne mesophilic bacteria inside the poultry breeding houses ranged from 4.74 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.89 x 10(8) cfu/m(3). for gram-negative bacteria, the range comprised the values from 4.33 x 10(2) cfu/m(3) to 4.29 x 10(6) cfu/m(3). the concentrations of the cocci of enterococcus genus ranged from 1.53 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 1.09 x 10(7) cfu/m(3), whereas those of other gram-positive bacteria from 3.78 x 10(4) cfu/m(3) to 6.65 x 10(7) cfu/m(3). the lowest concentrations of each group of the examined microorganisms were noted in the second measurement series when the air exchange in the breeding houses was over twice higher than in first and third measurement series because the mechanical ventilation was supported by natural ventilation (opened gates in the  buildings). the lowest concentrations of total bacteria were obtained in those buildings where one-day old chickens were kept. gram-positive bacteria of the genera: staphylococcus, enterococcus, corynebacterium, brevibacterium, micrococcus, cellulomonas, bacillus, aerococcus, and gram-negative bacteria of the genera: pseudomonas, moraxella, escherichia, enterobacter, klebsiella, pasteurella, pantoea were isolated. it was shown that for most of the investigated livestock premises the total bacteria concentrations exceeded the reference value of 1.0 x 10(5) cfu/m(3). furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms which are a potential threat to human health (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae ssp. ozaenae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium) were found among the identified bacteria. conclusions: the results indicate that the hygienic conditions of the working environment connected with litter bed system production of poultry are affected by changes of the efficiency of ventilation and create a direct health risk to employees. they should use personal protective measures to protect their respiratory tract, especially when  the gates in the hen houses are closed.

TI  == antibacterial and antimycobacterial lignans and flavonoids from larrea tridentata.
AB  == three lignans and four flavonoids were isolated and characterized from larrea tridentata and compounds were tested against 16 bacterial species/strains. results showed that: dihydroguaiaretic acid (1) had activity towards methicillin  resistant (mr) staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) 50 microg/ml) and multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic 12.5-50 microg/ml); 4-epi-larreatricin (2) was active against enterobacter cloacae (mic 12.5 microg/ml), as well as sensitive (mic 50 microg/ml) and mdr strains of m. tuberculosis (mic 25 microg/ml). 3'-demethoxy-6-o-demethylisoguaiacin (3) displayed activity against sensitive and resistant s. aureus (mic 25 microg/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic 12.5 microg/ml), escherichia coli (mic 50 microg/ml), e. cloacae (mic 12.5 microg/ml)  and mdr strains of m. tuberculosis (mic 12.5 microg/ml). 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8,3'-tetramethoxyflavone (4) and 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyflavone (5) were active against m. tuberculosis mdr strains having mic values of 25 and 25-50 microg/ml, respectively, while 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6) was active against s. aureus (mic 50 microg/ml) and e. faecalis (mic 50 microg/ml). we concluded that lignan 3 is the  main compound responsible for the antibacterial activity of l. tridentata. lignans 1 and 2 as well as flavonoid 6 contribute with some degree of antibacterial activity. on the other hand, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 contributed to the antimycobacterial activity found in l. tridentata.

TI  == kinetics and morphology of polymicrobial biofilm formation on polypropylene mesh.
AB  == we examined the ability of three clinical bacterial isolates to form mixed biofilms on surgical polypropylene mesh (ppm) in vitro. the three strains--staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae--were isolated from a patient with an infected ppm. staphylococcus aureus and e. faecalis (alone and in combination) were inoculated into culture containing squares of ppm and allowed to attach and propagate into mature biofilms. enterococcus faecalis initially attached to the mesh in greater numbers; however, 7 days postinoculation, there were more s. aureus cells attached, indicating that in vitro s. aureus is the out-competing species. all three isolates were then co-cultured to form mature biofilms on mesh, and the biofilms were examined by confocal microscopy using both live/dead staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish). imaging revealed a dense biofilm structure with interstitial voids and channels; rods and cocci were interspersed  throughout the biofilm, indicating bacterial coexistence in close proximity. fish revealed staphylococci and enterococci adjacent to each other and also to the enterobacter, distinguishable by its rod morphology. these studies show that different species can co-operatively form mature biofilms on mesh but that the relative abundance of a species within the biofilm may vary over time.

TI  == role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of n-acetylcysteine (nac) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. methods: we performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of nac. we also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with nac or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and fitc-labeled concanavalin a. we measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. all experiments were conducted in triplicate. tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa), s. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans and c. krusei. results: nac 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9%  reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of nac ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in nac-treated biofilms for all organisms except vre. the number of non-viable cells in nac-treated gram-positive biofilms  was increased (p<0.05 for mrsa and vre). nac-treated gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. conclusions: nac is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. nac has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == preparation and antibacterial evaluation of decarboxylated fluoroquinolones.
AB  == decarboxylated ciprofloxacin (3) has been reported in the literature to have antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and especially potent activity against escherichia coli. herein, we report our syntheses of 3 and five additional decarboxylated fluoroquinolones (fqs). we have re-evaluated the antibacterial activity of these  fqs. in contrast to previously reported data, none of these decarboxylated fluoroquinolones showed significant antibacterial activity in our assays using both the broth dilution and agar methods. our study confirmed that the presence of a carboxylic acid group at the 3-position of the fluoroquinolone scaffold is essential for antibacterial activity.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from vegetables with regards to the marketing stage (farm vs. supermarket).
AB  == the aim of this study was to elucidate whether and to what extent fresh produce from germany plays a role as a carrier and reservoir of antibiotic resistant bacteria. for this purpose, 1001 vegetables (fruit, root, bulbous vegetables, salads and cereals) were collected from 13 farms and 11 supermarkets in germany and examined bacteriologically. phenotypic resistance of enterobacter cloacae (n=172); enterobacter gergoviae (n=92); pantoea agglomerans (n=96); pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=295); pseudomonas putida (n=106) and enterococcus faecalis (n=100)  against up to 30 antibiotics was determined by using the microdilution method. resistance to ss-lactams was most frequently expressed by p. agglomerans and e. gergoviae against cefaclor (41% and 29%). relatively high resistance rates were also observed for doxycycline (23%), erythromycin (21%) and rifampicin (65%) in e. faecalis, for spectinomycin (28%) and mezlocillin (12%) in e. cloacae, as well as for streptomycin (19%) in p. putida. in p. aeruginosa, relatively low resistance rates were observed for the aminoglycosides amikacin, apramicin, gentamicin, neomycin, netilmicin and tobramycin (<4%); 11% was resistant to streptomycin. no glycopeptide-resistant enterococci were observed. resistance rates of bacteria isolated from farm samples were higher than those of the retail markets whenever significant differences were observed. this suggests that expressing resistance is at the expense of bacterial viability, since vegetables  purchased directly at the farm are probably fresher than at the supermarket, and  they have not been exposed to stress factors. however, this should not keep the customer from buying directly at the farm, since the overall resistance rates were not higher than observed in bacteria from human or animal origin. instead, peeling or washing vegetables before eating them raw is highly recommended, since it reduces not only the risk of contact with pathogens, but also that of ingesting and spreading antibiotic resistant bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  == maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal  bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin  for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == maggot excretions inhibit biofilm formation on biomaterials.
AB  == background: biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. questions/purposes: we studied biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. we compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. methods: comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. the formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. the optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. results: the strongest biofilms were formed by s. aureus and s. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. the highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. the presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. a maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. conclusions: our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == detecting related cases of bloodstream infections using time-interval distribution modelling.
AB  == an algorithm was designed to highlight related bloodstream infections using data  from a nosocomial infection surveillance system to help local public health authorities direct specific measures towards clusters of cases. the approach was  based on a two-step procedure. the first was a test to identify pathogens with an abnormal number of close cases. the second modelled, for the identified pathogens, the distribution of time intervals between successive cases as a mixture of two theoretical distributions in order to determine a threshold below  which a specific investigation is required. the algorithm was applied to bloodstream infection surveillance data collected during a 10-year period (1996-2005) in an 878-bed teaching hospital (24 wards) in lyon, france. the first step identified seven pathogens among the 18 being studied. the modelling succeeded in setting time thresholds to spot clusters of cases requiring further  investigation with defined sensitivity and specificity. setting the sensitivity level at 95%, the threshold values ranged from 24 days (acinetobacter baumannii)  to 294 days (enterobacter cloacae); the specificity was higher than 70% (up to 97.5% for a. baumannii) except for e. cloacae (52.1%). setting the specificity level at 95% resulted in a decrease in sensitivity except for a. baumannii (it reached nearly 100%); it fell below 50% for three pathogens: around 40% for streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and 25% for enterobacter cloacae. the threshold values then ranged from 8 days (s. pneumoniae) to 67 days  (streptococcus pyogenes). the approach proved promising though further refinements are needed before routine use.

AB  == objective: to illustrate the bacteriology and their susceptibility to antibiotics in patients with biliary tract diseases and provide information for antibiotic choices. methods: the bile specimens were cultured and pathogens' susceptibility  to antibiotics was obtained intraoperatively from 195 patients undergoing operations on biliary tract and 24 healthy liver donors from june 2007 to march 2008. results: among 195 bile specimens collected from the patients intraoperatively, 44 ones were found bacterial growth by culture (22.6%), in which 11 ones were mixed infections (25.0%). fifty-five bacterial strains belonging to 16 species were identified from these bile specimens. they included  34 gram negative strains (61.8%), 19 gram positive strains (34.6%) and 2 fungal strains (3.6%). the commonest pathogens were escherichia coli (27.3%), enterobacter cloacae (12.7%), enterococcus faecalis (12.7%) and enterococcus faecium (10.9%). among 24 bile specimens collected from the healthy liver donors, one was found escherichia coli growth by culture (4.2%). the results of susceptibility test showed that the resistant rates of gram negative strains to meropenem was 2.8%, followed by imipenem (5.6%), sulperazone (22.8%) and amikacin (28.7%). in this study gram negative strains were highly resistant to penicillins, quinolones, some third generation cephalosporins and so on (>50.0%). none of gram positive strains were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. they  were highly resistant to penicillins, quinolones, clindamycin and so on (>40.0%). conclusions: (1) gram negative strains remain the commonest pathogens in biliary  tract infection in renji hospital and the commonest pathogen is escherichia coli. the infection of enterococcus is going up. the mixed infection cases happen mostly in acute biliary infection. (2) to treat biliary infection the broad-spectrum antibiotics which are effective to escherichia coli are optimal choices. ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin may be used in mild biliary infection. sulperazone or amikacin may be used in severe biliary infection. imipenem and vancomycins may be used as second choice to treat the infection which other drugs are ineffective to.

AB  == mucosal surfaces provide first-line defense against microbial invasion through their complex secretions. the antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal  defense have not been defined. we found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein a-i. the predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide hnp-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against p. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. these data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. the emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases.

TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and etest.
AB  == the current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical u.s. isolates of target pathogens. findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (bmd) surveillance (d. c. draghi et al., poster d-0701, 46th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., san francisco, ca). differences were noted among acinetobacter spp. and serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus pyogenes. to address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by bmd and etest. in all, 1,800 staphylococcus aureus, 259 s. pyogenes, 226 streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 enterobacteriaceae, and 227 acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. tigecycline had potent activity by bmd, with >99.6% susceptibility (%s) observed for all pathogens with  interpretive criteria, excluding enterobacter cloacae (98.3% s) and e. faecalis (86.0% s), and mic(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (s. pyogenes/s. pneumoniae) to 1  mug/ml (enterobacteriaceae/a. baumannii). similar profiles were observed by etest, with the exception of a. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens  etest mics trended one doubling-dilution higher than bmd mics. major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding a. baumannii, s. marcescens, and s. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in mics were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline etest for testing s. marcescens, acinetobacter spp., and s. pneumoniae is warranted.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == chemical markers for the evaluation of raw material hygienic quality in egg products.
AB  == the aim of this research was to study uracil and lactic and acetic acids as chemical markers for hygienic quality evaluation of raw material in liquid pasteurized egg products. uracil, absent in sound whole eggs, was formed in raw and pasteurized egg products as a consequence of high microbial contamination (>10(6) cfu/g) after a sufficient lag time, remaining stable at 4 degrees c but disappearing after 7 days of storage at 25 degrees c. both lactic and acetic acids, starting from initial values of 1-7 mg/kg dry matter, presented trends similar to that of uracil; however, acetic acid never decreased during the storage of raw egg products. with few exceptions, all three metabolites were produced by enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, morganella morganii, serratia liquefaciens, aeromonas hydrophyla, pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus avium,  and enterococcus faecalis, separately inoculated in whole egg samples. uracil seems to be the most sensible marker, with a suggested limit corresponding to the detectable level.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  == efficacy of a novel biofilter in hatchery sanitation: i. removal of airborne bacteria, dust and endotoxin.
AB  == a novel biofilter containing organic, bentonite and halloysite media was applied  for elimination of microbial pollutants from the air of an industrial hatchery. the concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, thermophilic actinomycetes, dust and bacterial endotoxin were determined in the air of hatchery during 2 months before installation of the biofilter, and during  6 months after installation of the biofilter, at the inlet and outlet ducts from  each medium. before installation of the biofilter, the concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, thermophilic actinomycetes, dust and endotoxin in the air were within the ranges of 0.97-131.2x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.0-34.4x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.0-0.02x10(3) cfu/m3, 0.37-4.53 mg/m3, and 50.9-520,450.4 ng/m3, respectively. enterococcus faecalis and gram-negative bacteria (acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, and other species) prevailed among bacterial species recovered from the air of the hatchery. a total of 56 species or genera of bacteria were identified in the air samples taken in the examined hatchery; of these, 11, 11 and 6 species or genera respectively were reported as having allergenic, immunotoxic and/or infectious properties the concentrations of total mesophilic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, enterococcus faecalis and endotoxin found at the inlet duct of the biofilter after its installation were significantly smaller compared to those recorded before its installation (p<0.05). the concentrations of gram-negative bacteria, enterococcus faecalis and dust found at the outlet ducts of biofilter after its installation were significantly smaller compared to those recorded at the inlet duct of the biofilter (p<0.01). the concentrations of total meso-philic bacteria were also smaller at the outlet ducts of the biofilter compared to that at the inlet duct;  however, the difference was not significant because of the massive growth of streptomyces species in the biofilter's media which contaminated the outcoming air. in conclusion, the applied biofilter proved to be effective in the elimination of potentially pathogenic bacteria, dust and endotoxin from the air of the hatchery. the efficacy of the biofilter could be improved by the inhibition of the streptomyces growth in the media of the biofilter.

TI  == bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  == the most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. the most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. three bacterial species, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. other prevalent bacterial isolates were staphylococcus epidermidis and  enterococcus faecalis, while acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all intensive care unit (icu) isolates. 7% of s. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. although e. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. all the gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)=4 microg/ml. almost 10% of escherichia coli, 14% of klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of serratia marcescens and 50% of enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. amikacin was the most active antibiotic against p. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. finally, acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). the results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital  setting in italy.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  == a range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. the antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive acinetobacter  baumannii (bm4454), using a broth culture method. the rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. all five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter species, proteus species and e. coli. the spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. acticoat and contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanii. other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with mrsa.

TI  == pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the south american bullfrog leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  == norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the south american bullfrog, leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. the primary structure of a  previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as gly-leu-leu-asp-thr-leu-lys-gly-ala-ala-lys-asn-val-val-gly-ser-leu-ala-ser-lys-v al-met-glu-lys-leu.nh2. the second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the caribbean mountain chicken frog l. fallax. pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus group b) but potencies were relatively low (mic values in the range 25-200 microm). the peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (ld50>400 microm).

TI  == [pathogenic characters of infected bacteria after liver transplantation].
AB  == objective: to analyze the main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation and their antibiotic resistant patterns. methods: the main pathogens of infection after the liver transplantation were retrospectively analyzed. using 3-dimensional tests, esbls (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase), and ampc were detected among the gram negative bacilli. beta-lactamase and van gene in enterococcus were determined by the standard agar dilution susceptibility tests and nitrocefin respectively. results: the main infected strains were enterococcus faecalis (15.0%), enterobacter cloacae (13.9%), fungus (13.3%), and  escherichia coli (10.7%) after the liver transplantation. among them, 32.4% of enterobacter cloacae and 36.8% of escherichia coli produced esbls; 33.8% of enterobacter cloacae and 10.5% of escherichia coli. produced ampc beta-lactamases. the detectable rate of vana gene in enterococcusfaecalis and enterococcus faecium was 7.5% and 11.1%; vanb was 3.8% and 7.4%; vanc was 1.3% and 0, respectively. conclusion: the infection mainly occurs in the intestinal tract after the liver transplantation. the production of esbls and ampc beta-lactamases is the main mechanism of antibiotic resistance. the increased detectable rate of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus should be paid attention to.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  == four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz).  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem  showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected.  the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than  newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.

TI  == gram-positive mera gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  == clinical mercury resistant (hg(r)) gram-negative bacteria carrying gram-positive  mercury reductase (mera)-like genes were characterized using dna-dna hybridization, pcr and sequencing. a pcr assay was developed which discriminated  between the mera genes related to staphylococcus and those related to the bacillus/streptococcus mera genes by the difference in size of the pcr product. dna sequence analysis correlated with the pcr assay. the mera genes from acinetobacter junii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the staphylococcus aureus mera protein. a fourth mera gene, from pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the streptococcus oralis mera protein. all the hg(r) gram-negative bacteria transferred their gram-positive mera genes to a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants  expressing mercury resistance. these gram-positive mera genes join gram-positive  tetracycline resistance and gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  == the neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. this enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media.  the limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. the establishment of the gut microbial  population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. the climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. the foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. the maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. the bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. after the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. in full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces  the development of a flora rich in bifidobacterium spp. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also  enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. during the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to  bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. in other studies the presence of a consistent number  of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. the predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. according to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. in these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of  bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. in extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. the gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. according to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.

TI  == bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == effects of burn wound excision on bacterial colonization and invasion.
AB  == rates of survival after thermal injury have improved in the past two decades, and rates of wound infections and sepsis have decreased during the same period. early excision has been advocated as one of the major factors, but its safety and efficacy and the exact timing of burn excision are still under debate. it was hypothesized that acute burn wound excision (in the first 24 hours after burning) would be superior to conservative treatment and delayed excision in preventing bacterial colonization and invasion. twenty consecutive patients with thermal injuries were studied. twelve patients underwent acute burn wound excision, and eight patients underwent conservative treatment and delayed excision. the second  group of patients received topical treatments in another facility and underwent delayed excision after transfer to our service, on postburn day 6. quantitative bacteriological assessments of the excised wound and biopsy samples of the wound  bed, obtained before autografting and/or homografting, were performed. the effects of time on bacterial counts, differences between superficial and deep biopsy samples, and the effects of early versus late debridement were studied. patients admitted early exhibited bacterial counts of less than 10 bacteria per gram of tissue. patients in this group did not experience infection or graft loss. patients admitted late exhibited counts of more than 10 bacteria (p = 0.001, compared with early admission). three patients in the late excision group  experienced infection and graft loss (p < 0.05, compared with the early excision  group). burn wound excision significantly decreased bacterial colonization for all patients (p < 0.001). greater bacterial colonization and higher rates of infection were correlated with topical treatment and late excision (p < 0.001). it is concluded that burn wound excision significantly reduces bacterial colonization. patients who undergo topical treatment and delayed burn wound excision exhibit greater bacterial colonization and increased rates of infection. acute burn wound excision should be considered for all full-thickness burns.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

TI  == microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  == objective: to isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (aoe) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. study design: prospective core series. methods: specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. end point mean inhibitory concentration  (mic) testing was performed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) recommended methods. results: in alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the united states. a total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). the next 10 species most frequently isolated were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; microbacterium  alconae, 2.9%; staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; staphylococcus capitis subsp. ureolyticus,1.4%; and staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. susceptibility profiles of s. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/ml): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. susceptibility profiles of s. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%,  neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. p.  aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/ml for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. likewise, resistance of p. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. twenty isolates had neomycin mics >/=64 mcg/ml and 10 isolates had gentamicin mics >/=16 mcg/ml. the coryneform isolates identified as  microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin mics >/=16 mcg/ml) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin mics >/=32 mcg/ml and gentamicin mics >/=8 mcg/ml). conclusions: bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by p. aeruginosa. however, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are  recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-p. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.

AB  == in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 12228), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), enterobacter cloacae (atcc 13047), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and candida albicans (atcc 10239). selective  and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (p. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (e. faecalis and s. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. the enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction  of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

AB  == introduction: urinary tract infections (uti) account for 2-5% of consultations in general practice, but only about half the patients with dysuria have significant  bacteriuria (> 100,000 bacteria per ml). a microbiological diagnosis can be made  by examination of a urine sample, and in danish family practice the diagnosis of  uti is often reached by a microscopic analysis or a dip-slide culture test. these methods have a high validity when performed in hospital, but we need knowledge about the validity of microbiological urine examinations when performed in general practice. the aim of this study was to validate detection of bacteriuria  by urine microscopy and dip-slide culture in general practice. material and methods: urine specimens artificially produced by adding a known quantity of bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis) to sterile urine were sent  to 25 general practices for microscopic examination and dip-slide culture. no prior instruction in testing procedure was given. as the gold standard, the results of a standardised culture method performed by skilled laboratory technicians at the department of microbiology, university of southern denmark, were used. results: significant bacteriuria was identified by microscopy with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. the corresponding figures for urine  culture were 95% and 96%. the morphology of bacteria was interpreted correctly in 80% of microscopic examinations, and 60% of the bacteria strains were classified  correctly in terms of their motility. discussion: the results of urine microscopy and culture performed in general practice are to be relied on.

TI  == clinafloxacin versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of severe skin and  soft-tissue infections in adults at a veterans affairs medical center.
AB  == background: severe skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis), particularly diabetic foot infections, are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. inappropriate antimicrobial therapy may contribute to the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, as well as to increased health care costs. thus, there is a continuing search for reasonably safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agents that are less susceptible to the development of resistance than older agents. objective: the department of veterans affairs (va) medical center in nashville, tennessee, was i site in a multicenter, phase iii, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of clinafloxacin with those of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of adult  patients with ssti. methods: over an 18-month period, patients aged > or = 18 years with physical findings of acute bacterial ssti requiring hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clinafloxacin 200 mg iv every 12 hours or piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g  iv every 6 hours. after a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy with clinafloxacin 200 mg po every 12 hours or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg po every 8 hours could be made in the respective treatment groups. results: the center enrolled 84 patients (42 in each group), all but i of whom were male, reflecting the typical va medical center population. the mean age was 60 years (range, 36-80 years) in the clinafloxacin group and 65  years (range, 35-87) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the latter group was significantly older (p = 0.0482), which could have affected recovery rates. sixty-six patients were white and 18 were black. the mean ( +/- sd) duration of treatment was 10.69 +/- 5.34 days in the clinafloxacin group and 12.07 +/- 5.06 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the mean length of stay was 10.83 +/-  10.28 days and 14.95 +/- 19.20 days, respectively. fifty-three (63%) patients were switched to oral therapy (21 in the clinafloxacin group, 32 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). the most commonly isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. clinical cure rates and microbiologic eradication rates were similar between the 2 treatments. the piperacillin/ tazobactam arm experienced more all-cause adverse events than the clinafloxacin arm, although the difference was not statistically significant. the clinafloxacin arm experienced significantly more adverse events (eg, photosensitivity) that were judged by the investigator to be drug related (p = 0.034). conclusions: in this study population of hospitalized adults, clinafloxacin was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated sstis. appropriate precautions must be taken against exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light in patients receiving clinafloxacin, and adequate monitoring is necessary. further investigation is necessary into how the phototoxic effects of the flu oroquinolones can be limited.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == [utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  == the value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the fundacion favaloro, the fundacion para la lucha contra las enfermedades neurologicas de la infancia and the hospital de ninos ricardo gutierrez. a total  of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). bact-alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees c for 30 days in the bact-alert system. bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and sabouraud agar. a total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. the positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). the median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. the microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), escherichia coli (n = 18), acinetobacter spp (n = 9), candida spp (n = 8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), enterococcus faecalis, salmonella spp and capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecium, citrobacter diversus, candida albicans, klebsiella oxytoca, chryseomonas luteola, serratia marcescens, abiotrophia spp, campylobacter jejuni, moraxella catarrhalis, moraxella urethralis, neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group g streptococci, rhodococcus equi, micrococcus spp, cryptococcus neoformans  and streptococcus mitis (n = 1). in our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.

TI  == multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. amikacin-resistant enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance  to ss-lactam antibiotics. only 1% of the escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. this rate was higher for other enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for p. aeruginosa. the cross-resistance of oxacillin with other  antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. cross-resistance was only a minor problem in h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis. cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae.

TI  == tract microflora in saudi patients with cholelithiasis.
AB  == objectives: to identify the microflora in the gallbladder of patients undergoing  laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones, and the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates, as well as the usefulness of gram staining of bile at the time of operation. methods: bile samples were obtained from 112 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones and inoculated directly into aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles in the operating theatre. samples were also collected in sterile universal containers for gram staining of a centrifuged deposit. isolates were identified and their in-vitro susceptibilities determined by kirby bauer technique. results: of 112 bile samples examined, 28 (25%) were culture positive, four of which contained more than one organism. the most common organisms isolated were escherichia coli 9 (28.1%), enterococcus faecalis 5 (15.6%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (9.4%). in  one sample we found aeromonas hydrophilia and enterobacter cloacae. no anaerobes  were detected but candida albicans was isolated in one case. in 19 bile samples (67.8%) organisms were identified on gram stain. positive bile cultures were found statistically significant (p < 0.05) in patients over the age of 50 (13/32), in patients who developed post-operative fever (6/12) and patients who developed leucocytosis (5/6). conclusion: age over 50 years was the only significant pre-operative factor associated with positive bile cultures (p < 0.05). in view of the microflora of the gallbladder and the susceptibility pattern of our isolates we would suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis recommended  for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstones needs to be reviewed and the role of bacteribilia in the surgical management of cholelithiasis requires further study.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
AB  == the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the  inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities  of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.

TI  == use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  == the effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. in most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. washing skin samples twice  in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. campylobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus lentus, and salmonella typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, 1998.
AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == infective endocarditis in the premature neonate.
AB  == we describe a series of 11 high-risk neonates with infective endocarditis (ie) in this retrospective review. previously ie has rarely been diagnosed in newborns and is usually fatal. the frequency was 4.3 cases per 100 patients. five patients survived. microorganisms included gram positives such as s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, gram negatives such as klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. echocardiographic location of the lesions showed four left sided, five right sided, and two bilateral. we conclude that ie may be  more common than previously described. prompt diagnosis and treatment led to survival in 45% of our patients. prospective studies are needed to identify patients at risk and to establish the true incidence of ie in high-risk neonates.

TI  == comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 gram-negative and 498 gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. the activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate,  ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against citrobacter diversus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, serratia  marcescens, staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, group g streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, and e. faecium. the reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. the commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. there was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing enterobacter agglomerans and e. cloacae, where  the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher mic90 value.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

TI  == bacterial strains isolated from eggs and their resistance to currently used antibiotics: is there a health hazard for consumers?
AB  == in order to study the putative transfer of antibiotic resistance from poultry to  humans, hens' eggs were examined for the presence of various pathogens. staphylococcus, enterobacter, escherichia, proteus and pseudomonas spp. were the  most frequently isolated genera. sensitivity tests, performed with the kirby-bauer technique, showed the presence of resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus (to penicillin-g, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefalosporins,  oxacillin, gentamycin, chloramphenicol and tobramycin), enterococcus faecalis (to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, gentamycin and tetracyclin), escherichia  coli (to tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and cefalosporins), enterobacter  cloacae (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, erythromycin and tetracycline), pseudomonas stutzeri (to erythromycin and chlorampenicol) and citrobacter freundii (to ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavunalic acid, cefalosporins and co-trimoxazole).

TI  == beta-lactam stability in frozen microdilution pasco mic panels using strains with known resistance mechanisms as biosensors.
AB  == the stability of amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, and meropenem in pasco (pasco system, difco laboratories, detroit, mi,  usa) frozen microdilution susceptibility panels stored for 16 weeks at -20 degrees c and -70 degrees c was evaluated. the increase in mic values for the five american-type culture collection (atcc) quality control strains for susceptibility testing recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) and for 13 strains with different well-characterized resistance mechanisms was indicative of bioactivity deterioration. the overall agreement (+/- 1 twofold dilution) at purchase between the mic values of pasco frozen microdilution susceptibility panels and the standard agar dilution method  was 97.7%. minimum inhibitory concentration values for the associations of amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam remained unchanged for the study period at -70 degrees c. in contrast, a carbapenem bioactivity decrease was detected only with strains having well-characterized resistance mechanisms from the 12th week onwards. at -20 degrees c, antibiotic deterioration with these latter strains was observed earlier than with atcc strains: the activity of meropenem and imipenem remained unchanged only for the first 2 weeks, while a loss of activity was detected for amoxicillin/clavulanate and piperacillin/tazobactam at the 7th and 10th week, respectively. cefepime was highly stable both at -20 degrees c and -70 degrees c. strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms should be used in routine quality control studies of antibiotic stability for susceptibility testing panels during  the storage period.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of lb10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  == in vitro activity of lb10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. against gram-positive bacteria, lb10522 was most active among the compounds tested. it was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  and enterococcus faecalis. lb10522 was highly effective against most members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested. ninety percent of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. these activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, lb10522 with a mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml  was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by staphylococcus aureus giorgio, streptococcus pneumoniae iii, pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e, escherichia coli 851e, proteus mirabilis 1315e, serratia marcescens 1826e, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus ac-54. lb10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as tem-3, tem-7, shv-1, fec-1, and p-99. lb10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in enterobacter cloacae 1194e, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. time-kill study showed that lb10522, at concentrations of two or four times the mic, had a rapid bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus 6538p, escherichia coli 851e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e.

TI  == [determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
AB  == the determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the  patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. the methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. these beta-lactamases were obtained from enterobacter cloacae p99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia m 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. the strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture  were s. aureus m 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and e. faecalis m 2113, e. avium m 2091 and s. aureus m 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. for the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), e. coli m 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of k. pneumoniae atcc 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. when rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, e. coli m 1495 turned out more adequate. e. coli m 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of lb10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  == lb10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. lb10517 inhibited 90%  of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) at 0.25 mg/l (mic90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. lb10517 was two- or four-fold more active  than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis. both methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) were highly resistant to all compounds. lb10517 activity against most enterobacteriaceae was  comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in a mouse septicaemia model, lb10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. in a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of lb10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. it was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for tem-9 than the other test compounds. lb10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. lb10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in enterobacter cloacae 1194e.

TI  == bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit secondary to enterococcus fecalis.
AB  == bacteremia is often a serious and recurring problem in children with hemodialysis catheters. we report an outbreak of enterococcus bacteremia in a pediatric hemodialysis unit occurring from june 1992 to june 1993. during this period, 18 episodes of bacteremia occurred in eight children; 11 infections were polymicrobial. enterococcus fecalis was associated with 13 infections in five patients (8 polymicrobial). other pathogens included enterobacter cloacae (5 infections), staphylococcus (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), and klebsiella pneumoniae (2). all enterococcus infections occurred in patients with dual-lumen  subclavian venous catheters. skin and catheter sites were culture negative, except in one patient. rectal swabs were positive for enterococcus in five patients. enterococcus was not isolated from any source within the unit. serotypes of all enterococcus isolates were different, except for 2 isolates in the same patient. starting in june 1993, catheters were flushed after dialysis with vancomycin or ampicillin. since initiating this procedure, further episodes  of enterococcus bacteremia have not occurred. a questionnaire sent to other pediatric hemodialysis units failed to identify enterococcus among 26 cases of bacteremia. in conclusion: (1) enterococcus is an unusual pathogen for hemodialysis-related bacteremia in children; (2) patients with dialysis catheters were predisposed to this infection; (3) a common source for enterococcus could not be identified by either culture or by serotyping; (4) flushing catheters with antibiotics after dialysis was effective prevention.

AB  == isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (vc), forced expiratory volume (fev1.0), pao2 and paco2. vc of the patients from whom mssa (methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus) or enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), branhamella catarrhalis (b. catarrhalis) or haemophilus influenza (h. influenza)  were isolated. fev1.0 had a similar tendency as vc in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. similarly, po2 of the patients from whom mssa or e. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated, and pco2  of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza were isolated. there was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom  mssa, escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), xanthomonas maltophilia (x. maltophilia) or enterobacter cloacae (e. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom s. pneumonia, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated. these results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza to mssa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, x. maltophilia or e. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. the treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  == growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

AB  == the change of ulcer size in relation to the presence of species and quantities of microorganisms was analysed in 58 patients with venous leg ulcers, all without clinical signs of infection. microbiological samples were taken on the day of inclusion and then repeated 4 times at monthly intervals or until the ulcer had healed or was too small to be cultured from. there was growth of microorganisms in all ulcers, and the numbers were below 10(4) per mm2 of ulcer surface in all cases. no correlation was found between ulcer size change and the species and amounts of microorganisms. sixty-nine species were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was found in 88%, enterococcus faecalis in 74%, enterobacter cloacae and peptococcus magnus in 29%, and fungi in 11% of the samples. one or more obligate  anaerobe species was found in 41% of the samples and in half of the ulcers and constituted 62% of all bacterial species. the colonising ulcer flora was markedly constant over time in the individual ulcers regardless of change in size. resident bacterial species were found in 57 of the 58 ulcers. if all samples were considered, the microorganisms were associated with not more than one fifth of the variability in healing rate, as shown by linear multiple regression analysis. the same species of microorganisms were found in ulcers that decreased (or healed) and in those that increased in size. although an association between the  microorganisms and ulcer healing could not be ruled out in this study, there seems to be no indication for routinely performed culture in the absence of clinical signs of infection in venous leg ulcers.

TI  == in vitro activity of sce-2787, a new cephalosporin with potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the in vitro activity of sce-2787, 7-[(z)-2-(5-amino-1,2,4-thiadiazol-3- yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-(1-imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazinium)methy l-3- cephem-4-carboxylate, was compared with those of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem against recent clinical isolates. sce-2787 inhibited 50% of tested isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae at < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. sce-2787  was equally active as or more active than ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against members of the enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of proteus vulgaris. the mic of sce-2787 at which 90% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited was 2 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold lower than those of imipenem and  ceftazidime, respectively. sce-2787, like ceftazidime and imipenem, did not inhibit the majority of strains of pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia. sce-2787 inhibited beta-hemolytic streptococci at < or = 0.12 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, or the anaerobic species tested. methicillin-resistant staphylococci required sce-2787 mics of > or = 16 micrograms/ml, whereas methicillin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. no difference between the mics and mbcs was noted, except for p. aeruginosa, for which there was a fourfold difference. sce-2787 was active over a ph range of 6 to 8. the inoculum size of 10(5) to 10(7) cfu caused only a twofold change in the mic for escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but a 4- to 16-fold change in  enterobacter cloacae and p. aeruginosa. beta-lactamases from bush groups 1, 2a, and 2b did not hydrolyze sce-2787. there was significant hydrolysis of sce-2787 by the beta-lactamases designated 2b', i.e., tem-3, tem-5, tem-7, and tem-9, and  by the group 2d beta-lactamases. sce-2787 had poor affinity for group 1 and group 2b enzymes and constitutively produced chromosomal beta-lactamases such as p-99 of enterobacter cloacae and plasmid-mediated tem-1 of e. coli. sce-2787 has in vitro activity comparable to that of current parenteral cephalosporin and is more active against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of sy5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. sy5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, morganella morganii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, clostridium spp., and bacteroides fragilis. against providencia spp., proteus spp., and haemophilus influenzae, sy5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. sy5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. enterococcus faecium, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. the bactericidal activities of sy5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the mics for clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sy5555  was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. however, sy5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by x. maltophilia (l-1) and p. aeruginosa/pms354 beta-lactamases, two bush group 3 beta-lactamases, sy5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from  c. freundii gn7391 and e. cloacae gn7471 strains. these results suggest that sy5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == catheter related bacterial infections mimic reactions to exogenous pyrogens during hemodialysis.
AB  == pyrogenic reactions are characterized by fever, chills, hypotension, or a combination of these developing during or shortly after hemodialysis in a previously asymptomatic patient. the temporal association with treatment implicates exposure of the patient's blood to bacterial pyrogens from contaminated dialysate or a reused dialyzer. routine body temperature monitoring  is recommended to detect these exposures. the current study was prompted by the appearance of several symptomatic febrile episodes in patients who were asymptomatic and afebrile before treatment with high-flux hemodialysis. during a  6 month period, temperatures were measured with a digital oral thermometer before and after 9,605 high-flux hemodialyses in 163 patients. elevations above 100 degrees f (37.8 degrees c) were observed during or after 33 dialyses in 15 patients. in 18 of these dialyses, the temperature was also elevated before treatment began. four patients who had no symptoms or fever before dialysis accounted for febrile reactions during 11 of the remaining 15 dialysis treatments. fever was accompanied by rigors during most of the episodes. subsequent blood cultures grew enterococcus faecalis (two), enterobacter cloacae  (two), and pseudomonas aeruginosa and cepacia (one). all four patients had indwelling silastic double lumen venous catheters (permcaths), all responded to intravenous antibiotics, and all required eventual removal of the catheter. the apparent precipitation of sepsis by dialysis indicates that shear forces caused by high pulsatile blood flow through the catheter may dislodge organisms that have colonized the lumen. intraluminal instillation of antibiotics is suggested as a preventative measure.

TI  == [study on mic breakpoint and method of antimicrobial chemotherapy for moderately  complicated urinary tract infection--study using an automatic simulator of urinary antimicrobial agent concentrations].
AB  == we experimentally investigated an efficient administrating method of antimicribials prior to the clinical treatment of complicated urinary tract infection without catheter. an experimental model of moderately complicated urinary tract infection, which can simulate changes in the urinary concentration  of antimicrobials by means of previously reported computer control method, was used for the experiment. the following results were obtained. 1. at first, for complicated uti cases without an indwelling catheter, an investigation was made of the clinical therapy results to determine the upper mic range of bacteria, including isolated strains, that can be nearly eliminated following treatment, by the administration method. we then estimated the clinical breakpoint. 2. by adjusting the size of the diverticulum in a urinary bladder model, we prepared a  model which gave comparatively good agreement between the clinical and experimental breakpoints. 3. the clinical therapy results revealed that by the clinical breakpoint was higher in degree of coverage of the mic distribution of causative bacteria associated with a higher actual clinical elimination rate and  a higher efficacy rate. 4. it was surmised that an efficient administration method for complicated uti without an indwelling catheter can be established if the urinary bladder model and the following approach are applied: prior to clinical treatment it should be determined what would be high enough to cover 70% of the mic distribution of the estimated causative bacteria of uti, and then an administration method which would yield that concentration as the experimental breakpoint should be devised.

TI  == [staghorn renal lithiasis treated with shock waves. bacteriologic aspects].
AB  == struvite renal stones are caused by infection of the urine with bacteria that synthesize the enzyme urease. ammonium is released by the breakdown of urea by urease, the urine becomes highly alkaline, and magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and carbonate apatite crystallize. incorporation of the infecting bacteria within the developing stone, results in a focus of infection that is resistant to conventional antimicrobial therapy, and which is manifested clinically by repeated urinary tract infection caused by persistent bacteriuria.  extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (eswl) currently is accepted as the election treatment for most renal calculi. this trial examines the bacteriologic  aspects pre and post-eswl. eighty adult patients, 47 females and 33 males, without clinical signs of urinary tract infections (uti) were submitted to urine  cultures pre and post-eswl. the first 50 patients underwent during and post-eswl, 150 blood cultures, which all proved to be negative, confirming very low risk of  generalized sepsis. no patient presented fever, chills or rigors pre or postprocedures. with respect to urine cultures 43 patients (52.5%) had a pre-eswl uti, in comparison to 49 (60%) who had a uti post-eswl. the distribution of organisms pre and post-eswl was as follows: proteus mirabilis (22/22), escherichia coli (11/11), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4/5), klebsiella pneumoniae (2/2), enterobacter cloacae (0/1), alcaligenes odorans (1/2) enterococcus faecalis (1/3), staphylococcus saprophyticus (1/2) and candida albicans (1/1). in this study 6 patients presented bacteriuria post-eswl probably due to bacteria from inside the calculi. according to these results, the risk of bacteremia seems to be very low. in 60% of staghorn renal stones we could demonstrate a bacterial  infection.

TI  == handwashing and disinfection of heavily contaminated hands--effective or ineffective?
AB  == hands are among the principal vehicles for transfer of nosocomial pathogens in hospitals. often, outbreaks of infection are thought to be caused by a lack of compliance with handwashing guidelines, rather than due to the inadequacy of the  handwashing agents used. in this study the effectiveness of proper handwashing and the use of three different hand disinfectants: ethanol 70% (e), isopropanol 40% (i) and alcoholic chlorhexidine (70%) (ac) was compared using three volunteers whose fingertips were heavily contaminated with a succession of bacteria including: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. after each contamination, thorough handwashing and application of one disinfectant on the hands were performed three times. fingerprint-samples were taken before and 1 min after application of the disinfectants. thorough handwashing with an ordinary liquid soap ('sterisol') did not reduce the confluent growth of bacteria on fingertips for any of the species  used (197 examinations). only ac had a significant effect on fingers heavily contaminated with s. aureus (126 examinations; ac compared with e and i; p less than 0.0002 and p less than 0.0002 respectively), but did not completely eradicate the bacteria. after contamination with ent. cloacae (118 examinations), none of the three agents were particularly effective, but e and ac seemed to be somewhat more effective than i (p less than 0.0002 and p less than 0.01 respectively). when successive contamination was performed using all bacterial species, ac was the most effective decontaminant. however, ent. cloacae was still present on the fingertips after 15 repeated courses of handwashing and applications of disinfectants. bathing of hands in ac for 20s completely eradicated all bacteria from the hands. the study demonstrates that, when heavily contaminated, an ordinary handwashing followed by disinfectants is not enough to  eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria from the hands.

AB  == wound bacterial colonization in 118 patients treated with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% in silver sulfadiazine 1% applied daily to the burn wounds was compared to that of 135 comparable patients similarly treated with silver sulfadiazine 1%. with chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2% in silver sulfadiazine 1%, colonization by staphylococcus aureus was less frequent (38%) than with silver sulfadiazine (54%, p = 0.016). no statistical difference was found for colonization by enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or enterobacter cloacae. washing of the wounds of 65 patients with chlorhexidine gluconate 4% during daily dressing changes was associated with reduced wound colonization by s. aureus (35% versus 51%, p = 0.03) and p. aeruginosa (8% versus 16%, p = 0.08)  when compared to the 188 washed with nonantibacterial soap. chlorhexidine, whether added to the topical agent silver sulfadiazine (chlorhexidine digluconate 0.2%) or in the bath soap (chlorhexidine gluconate 4%), decreased colonization by s. aureus.

TI  == fleroxacin combined with rifampin.
AB  == we determined the effect of the combination of rifampin and fleroxacin against enterobacteriaceae and streptococcal species. none of the 65 isolates tested by checkerboard assay demonstrated synergy, 12% of isolates showed an additive effect; 86.7% were indifferent, and only 1 isolate showed antagonism. the mean fic was 1.2. when using 2 and 8 micrograms/ml of rifampin, fleroxacin mics of 285 isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococci, streptococci, bacteroides, and clostridium were not increased, but synergy was not demonstrated. time-kill studies against escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis failed to show increased killing when the two agents were present at one-half the mbc. the fleroxacin-rifampin interaction is one of indifference but  provides coverage for species not adequately inhibited by fleroxacin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin administered intravenously in a pharmacodynamic in vitro model.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was evaluated in an in vitro model by simulating its pharmacokinetics following a single 100 or 200 mg administration intravenously. the one compartment open model described by grasso and coworkers was used for these experiments. ciprofloxacin concentrations in the model were reproduced by calculations based on the concentration-time curve in human volunteers as reported by wise and others. the maximum reduction of viable cell count for enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus was from two-to three-orders of magnitude; for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae from four to seven orders. a rapid killing was recorded both for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but the initial killing was more prolonged and more pronounced for the  higher dosage. the last did not interfere with regrowth that occurred for all strains after eight hours.

AB  == a total of 122 bacterial strains isolated from urine specimens of 113 female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis were used for the study of beta-lactamase production and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents was determined. beta-lactamase activity was qualitatively determined by a  paper strip acidimetric method with benzylpenicillin as substrate and by chromogenic cephalosporin methods using pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin or nitrocefin as substrate. susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, gentamicin, minocycline, fosfomycin, pipemidic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was examined by a disc method. the beta-lactamase-producing strains detected by at least one of the three tests were found in 18 of 105 escherichia coli isolates and in the single strain of enterobacter cloacae dermidis, 3 enterococcus faecalis and 1 staphylococcus aureus produced beta-lactamase. the isolation rate  of strains resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin in the beta-lactamase-producing strains was significantly higher than that in the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains (p less than 0.01). these results suggest that beta-lactamase plays an important role in developing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection as well as complicated infection.

TI  == [effect of aztreonam on the fecal aerobic flora in children].
AB  == aztreonam, a new monobactam, has a spectrum limited to gram negative aerobic bacilli. to evaluate its effect after parenteral administration on aerobic stool  flora (gram negative bacilli, streptococci d, staphylococci, candida), quantitative cultures used serial dilution of stools twice a week on selective media. for gram negative bacilli, agar dishes containing aztreonam or not were used. colonies of different morphologies were counted. representatives of each morphological type were then picked for identification and susceptibility tests.  among the 16 patients treated, 12 were decontaminated for aerobic gram negative bacilli by the 3rd day. sensitive bacteria persisted in 4 cases, although at a low level. resistant bacteria (enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter) appeared at a "normal" level in 2 patients initially decontaminated. no dramatic change could be detected for streptococci d, staphylococci and candida. in twelve additional infants neither hospitalized nor treated, no aztreonam resistant gram  negative bacilli could be found.

TI  == in-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  == pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. a comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (escherichia coli, indole + proteus spp., enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp. and shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (klebsiella pneumoniae). pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). the mic90 of pefloxacin against 100 staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). it was markedly less active against streptococcus faecalis and str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the mic90 being 4 mg/l against both species. overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against p. aeruginosa, s. epidermidis, and s. aureus. against e. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. a paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. an optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in  blood of patients treated with this drug.

TI  == cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  == hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. the search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. in this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. in each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were  obtained. all organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. in the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. after the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. this therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. in our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. the predominant organisms isolated were staphylococcus aureus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. in most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. all but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
