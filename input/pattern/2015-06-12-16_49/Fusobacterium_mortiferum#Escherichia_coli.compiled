TI  - Participation of strictly anerobic bacteria in infections among hospitalized transplant patients in a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many strictly anerobic bacteria are a part of the human commensal microflora. Especially multitudinously they inhabit the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory, and genital tracts. Infections with these bacteria may occur after escape of the bacteria from their natural habitat. There are often mixed anerobic and aerobic infections. After rupture of the gastrointestinal tract or surgery, the organisms can cause significant pathology including abscesses and bacteremia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of gram-negative strictly anerobic bacteria isolated from different samples collected from patients on transplant wards. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from patients with suspected infections. Underwent isolation and identification of microorganisms under anerobic conditions using standard laboratory methods. RESULTS: Gram-negative rods were observed in 46% of clinical samples, most frequently Bacteroides genus as well as Fusobacterium necrophorum/F.nucleatum and F.mortiferum (14%). Most species of the genus Bacteroides were accompanied by Escherichia coli, less frequently with other aerobic gram-negative rods or gram-positive cocci. CONCLUSION: Gram-negative bacteria were frequently isolated in the samples. Because they are the part of the normal flora, this observation indicated the endogenous nature of infections resulting from bacterial translocation out of their natural habitat.
TI  - Metabolism of sucrose and its five isomers by Fusobacterium mortiferum.
AB  - Fusobacterium mortiferum utilizes sucrose [glucose-fructose in alpha(1-->2) linkage] and its five isomeric alpha-D-glucosyl-D-fructoses as energy sources for growth. Sucrose-grown cells are induced for both sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase (S6PH) and fructokinase (FK), but the two enzymes are not expressed above constitutive levels during growth on the isomeric compounds. Extracts of cells grown previously on the sucrose isomers trehalulose alpha(1-->1), turanose alpha(1-->3), maltulose alpha(1-->4), leucrose alpha(1-->5) and palatinose alpha(1-->6) contained high levels of an NAD+ plus metal-dependent phospho-alpha-glucosidase (MalH). The latter enzyme was not induced during growth on sucrose. MalH catalysed the hydrolysis of the 6'-phosphorylated derivatives of the five isomers to yield glucose 6-phosphate and fructose, but sucrose 6-phosphate itself was not a substrate. Unexpectedly, MalH hydrolysed both alpha- and beta-linked stereomers of the chromogenic analogue p-nitrophenyl glucoside 6-phosphate. The gene malH is adjacent to malB and malR, which encode an EII(CB) component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar:phosphotransferase system and a putative regulatory protein, respectively. The authors suggest that for F. mortiferum, the products of malB and malH catalyse the phosphorylative translocation and intracellular hydrolysis of the five isomers of sucrose and of related alpha-linked glucosides. Genes homologous to malB and malH are present in both Klebsiella pneumoniae and the enterohaemorrhagic strain Escherichia coli O157:H7. Both these organisms grew well on sucrose, but only K. pneumoniae exhibited growth on the isomeric compounds.
TI  - The gene glvA of Bacillus subtilis 168 encodes a metal-requiring, NAD(H)-dependent 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase. Assignment to family 4 of the glycosylhydrolase superfamily.
AB  - The gene glvA (formerly glv-1) from Bacillus subtilis has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein GlvA (449 residues, Mr = 50,513) is a unique 6-phosphoryl-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl:phosphoglucohydrolase (6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase) that requires both NAD(H) and divalent metal (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, or Ni2+) for activity. 6-Phospho-alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.122) from B. subtilis cross-reacts with polyclonal antibody to maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase from Fusobacterium mortiferum, and the two proteins exhibit amino acid sequence identity of 73%. Estimates for the Mr of GlvA determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (51,000) and electrospray-mass spectroscopy (50,510) were in excellent agreement with the molecular weight of 50,513 deduced from the amino acid sequence. The sequence of the first 37 residues from the N terminus determined by automated analysis agreed precisely with that predicted by translation of glvA. The chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates, p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate and 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate were used for the discontinuous assay and in situ detection of enzyme activity, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis shows that three acidic residues, Asp41, Glu111, and Glu359, are required for GlvA activity. Asp41 is located at the C terminus of a betaalphabeta fold that may constitute the dinucleotide binding domain of the protein. Glu111 and Glu359 may function as the catalytic acid (proton donor) and nucleophile (base), respectively, during hydrolysis of 6-phospho-alpha-glucoside substrates including maltose 6-phosphate and trehalose 6-phosphate. In metal-free buffer, GlvA exists as an inactive dimer, but in the presence of Mn2+ ion, these species associate to form the NAD(H)-dependent catalytically active tetramer. By comparative sequence alignment with its homologs, the novel 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase from B. subtilis can be assigned to the nine-member family 4 of the glycosylhydrolase superfamily.
TI  - 6-phospho-alpha-D-glucosidase from Fusobacterium mortiferum: cloning, expression, and assignment to family 4 of the glycosylhydrolases.
AB  - The Fusobacterium mortiferum malH gene, encoding 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase (maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase; EC 3.2.1.122), has been isolated, characterized, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The relative molecular weight of the polypeptide encoded by malH (441 residues; Mr of 49,718) was in agreement with the estimated value (approximately 49,000) obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the enzyme purified from F. mortiferum. The N-terminal sequence of the MalH protein obtained by Edman degradation corresponded to the first 32 amino acids deduced from the malH sequence. The enzyme produced by the strain carrying the cloned malH gene cleaved [U-14C]maltose 6-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate (Glc6P) and glucose. The substrate analogs p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate (pNP alphaGlc6P) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate (4MU alphaGlc6P) were hydrolyzed to yield Glc6P and the yellow p-nitrophenolate and fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferyl aglycons, respectively. The 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase expressed in E. coli (like the enzyme purified from F. mortiferum) required Fe2+, Mn2+, Co2+, or Ni2+ for activity and was inhibited in air. Synthesis of maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase from the cloned malH gene in E. coli was modulated by addition of various sugars to the growth medium. Computer-based analyses of MalH and its homologs revealed that the phospho-alpha-glucosidase from F. mortiferum belongs to the seven-member family 4 of the glycosylhydrolase superfamily. The cloned 2.2-kb Sau3AI DNA fragment from F. mortiferum contained a second partial open reading frame of 83 residues (designated malB) that was located immediately upstream of malH. The high degree of sequence identity of MalB with IIB(Glc)-like proteins of the phosphoenol pyruvate dependent:sugar phosphotransferase system suggests participation of MalB in translocation of maltose and related alpha-glucosides in F. mortiferum.
TI  - Phospho-beta-glucosidase from Fusobacterium mortiferum: purification, cloning, and inactivation by 6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone.
AB  - 6-Phosphoryl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl:6-phosphoglucohydrolase (P-beta-glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.86) has been purified from Fusobacterium mortiferum. Assays for enzyme activity and results from Western immunoblots showed that P-beta-glucosidase (Mr, 53,000; pI, 4.5) was induced by growth of F. mortiferum on beta-glucosides. The novel chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside-6-phosphate (pNPbetaGlc6P) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside-6-phosphate (4MUbetaGlc6P), respectively, were used for the assay of P-beta-glucosidase activity. The enzyme hydrolyzed several P-beta-glucosides, including the isomeric disaccharide phosphates cellobiose-6-phosphate, gentiobiose-6-phosphate, sophorose-6-phosphate, and laminaribiose-6-phosphate, to yield glucose-6-phosphate and appropriate aglycons. The kinetic parameters for each substrate are reported. P-beta-glucosidase from F. mortiferum was inactivated by 6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone (P-glucono-delta-lactone) derived via oxidation of glucose 6-phosphate. The pbgA gene that encodes P-beta-glucosidase from F. mortiferum has been cloned and sequenced. The first 42 residues deduced from the nucleotide sequence matched those determined for the N terminus by automated Edman degradation of the purified enzyme. From the predicted sequence of 466 amino acids, two catalytically important glutamyl residues have been identified. Comparative alignment of the amino acid sequences of P-beta-glucosidase from Escherichia coli and F. mortiferum indicates potential binding sites for the inhibitory P-glucono-delta-lactone to the enzyme from F. mortiferum.
TI  - Purification from Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557 of a 6-phosphoryl-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl:6-phosphoglucohydrolase that hydrolyzes maltose 6-phosphate and related phospho-alpha-D-glucosides.
AB  - 6-Phosphoryl-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl:6-phosphoglucohydrolase (6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase) has been purified from Fusobacterium mortiferum ATCC 25557. p-Nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate (pNP alpha Glc6P) served as the chromogenic substrate for detection and assay of enzyme activity. The O2-sensitive, metal-dependent phospho-alpha-glucosidase was stabilized during purification by inclusion of dithiothreitol and Mn2+ ion in chromatography buffers. Various 6-phosphoryl-O-alpha-linked glucosides, including maltose 6-phosphate, pNP alpha Glc6P, trehalose 6-phosphate, and sucrose 6-phosphate, were hydrolyzed by the enzyme to yield D-glucose 6-phosphate and aglycone moieties in a 1:1 molar ratio. 6-Phospho-alpha-glucosidase (M(r) of approximately 49,000; pI of approximately 4.9) is activated by Fe2+, Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+, and the maximum rate of pNP alpha Glc6P hydrolysis occurs at 40 degrees C within the pH range 7.0 to 7.5. The sequence of the first 32 amino acids of 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase exhibits 67% identity (90% similarity) to that deduced for the N terminus of a putative phospho-beta-glucosidase (designated ORF f212) encoded by glvG in Escherichia coli. Western blots involving highly specific polyclonal antibody against 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase and spectrophotometric analyses with pNP alpha Glc6P revealed only low levels of the enzyme in glucose-, mannose-, or fructose-grown cells of F. mortiferum. Synthesis of 6-phospho-alpha-glucosidase increased dramatically during growth of the organism on alpha-glucosides, such as maltose, alpha-methylglucoside, trehalose, turanose, and palatinose.
TI  - Fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  - A total of 243 strains of Fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. The strains included 65 (27%) Fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) Fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) Fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) Fusobacterium varium, three (1%) Fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) Fusobacterium gonidiaformans. Most Fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). Predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. These included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). Fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. The organisms most commonly isolated with Fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. (95), Bacteroides fragilis group (80), Escherichia coli (43) and Bacteroides sp. (39). Most strains of B. fragilis group and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. Most pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). All patients, except two who died, recovered. These findings illustrate the prevalence of Fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
TI  - Therapeutic effect of cefotetan in an experimental local infection with facultative and obligate anaerobes in granuloma pouches in rats.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of cefotetan against experimentally induced infections with Escherichia coli. Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis or Fusobacterium mortiferum in the granuloma pouches of rats were compared with those of cefmetazole and cefazolin. Of these antibiotics, cefotetan showed the greatest therapeutic effect against the four bacterial infections after a single intramuscular administration. Cefotetan was found to give much higher pouch exudate concentrations than cefmetazole, and to show prolonged antibacterial levels even when compared with cefazolin. In the granuloma pouch, cefotetan produced similar morphological changes in the cells of E. coli NY-17 as have been observed in vitro by microscopy. Elongation and bulge formation were noted.
TI  - Bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - The effects of Bacteroides sp., Fusobacterium mortiferum, Bacteroides fragilis, and Sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of Escherichia coli and Salmonella minnesota, wild type and R595. Intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid A of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of coagulation. Lipopolysaccharide and lipid A of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause aggregation of human platelets in vitro. Washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid A of Bacteroides sp. and F. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and C6-deficient rabbit plasma. Lipid A, but not lipopolysaccharide, of E. coli and washed cells of S. minnesota R595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. These results indicated that Bacteroides sp. and F. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets or terminal components of complement.
