TI  - Comparative study of some biological activities of porins extracted from various  microorganisms.
AB  - The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria contains some major proteins, called porins, with particular chemical and physical characteristics which reflect some specialized functions peculiar to the outer membrane. In recent years the biological properties of Salmonella typhimurium SH5014 porins have been the focus of our experimental studies. The aim of the present research was to make a comparative investigation of the biological activities of porins extracted from other microorganisms classified in the Enterobacteriaceae, together with a taxonomically different one, Eikenella corrodens frequently isolated from gum pockets of patients with periodontal disease. Porins from E. coli K12, Proteus mirabilis and Eikenella corrodens were extracted, purified and separated from LPS by means of phenol extraction. The purity of preparation was checked by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in slabs. We studied the interactions of these proteins with some cellular and humoral systems within the host. Mouse peritoneal macrophages in the presence of these proteins show morphological and functional modifications, depending upon the type of porins and the concentrations used. The ability of porins to interact with the complement system was investigated in vitro. A pool of sera from 20 blood donors served as a source of human complement. The results obtained with porins of various sources were shown comparatively.
TI  - Tobramycin and cephalothin for treatment of suspected sepsis in neutropenic children with cancer.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of tobramycin and cephalothin in treatment of suspected sepsis were studied in neutropenic children with various malignancies. Twenty episodes of suspected sepsis in 19 febrile children with cancer were treated with parenteral tobramycin and cephalothin; the duration of therapy ranged from one to 80 days. In 14 of the 20 episodes of suspected sepsis, a favorable clinical response was achieved within five days after initiation of antibiotic therapy. These episodes included a urinary tract infection with Proteus mirabilis and sepsis due to Escherichia coli. In four of the additional six episodes, clinical deterioration was though to be caused by the underlying malignancies. Two episodes included a case of E. coli spesis that ended fatally and a nosocomial infection with Eikenella corrodens. Results of this study suggest that combination therapy with tobramycin and cephalothin is safe and efficacious in treatment of suspected sepsis in febrile children with malignancies and neutropenia.
