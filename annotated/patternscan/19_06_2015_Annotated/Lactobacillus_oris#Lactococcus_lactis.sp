TI  == characterization of some bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented foods.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from different sources (dairy products, fruits, fresh and fermented vegetables, fermented cereals) were screened for antimicrobial activity against other bacteria, including potential pathogens and  food spoiling bacteria. six strains have been shown to produce bacteriocins: lactococcus lactis 19.3, lactobacillus plantarum 26.1, enterococcus durans 41.2,  isolated from dairy products and lactobacillus amylolyticus p40 and p50, and lactobacillus oris p49, isolated from bors. among the six bacteriocins, there were both heat stable, low molecular mass polypeptides, with a broad inhibitory spectrum, probably belonging to class ii bacteriocins, and heat labile, high molecular mass proteins, with a very narrow inhibitory spectrum, most probably belonging to class iii bacteriocins. a synergistic effect of some bacteriocins mixtures was observed. we can conclude that fermented foods are still important sources of new functional lab. among the six characterized bacteriocins, there might be some novel compounds with interesting features. moreover, the bacteriocin-producing strains isolated in our study may find applications as protective cultures.
