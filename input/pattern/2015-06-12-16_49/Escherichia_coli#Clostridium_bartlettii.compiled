TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Effect of susceptibility to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4 and of dietary tryptophan on gut microbiota diversity observed in healthy young pigs.
AB  - Healthy weaned pigs susceptible to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4 (ETEC) require more tryptophan (Trp) to maximize their performance. This may be related to an effect on intestinal microbiota. We studied the intestinal bacterial diversity of healthy pigs with different susceptibility to ETEC and fed different Trp levels. Thirty-six littermate weaned pigs were selected to obtain a set potentially formed of 50% ETEC-susceptible and 50% non-susceptible pigs, based on a Mucin 4 gene polymorphism. Pigs were fed a diet with 0.17 (TrpL) or 0.22 (TrpH) standardized ileal digestible Trp:Lys ratio for 21 days. Slaughtered pigs were classified into non-susceptible, mildly susceptible, and susceptible, by testing ETEC adhesion to intestinal villi. Bacterial diversity in jejunum content was assessed by the 16S rRNA gene-targeted denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting analysis and expressed by the Shannon index. Susceptible pigs had a reduced bacterial diversity, particularly with TrpL diet (p=0.003). The ETEC adhesion class affected the quantification of enterobacteria DNA (p=0.027). One DGGE band, which referred to Clostridium bartlettii, was not evidenced in all the susceptible pigs; less DNA from this microbe was quantified by RT-PCR in the jejunum from TrpH susceptible pigs (p=0.025) compared to TrpL. The gene expression for beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 1 was higher in jejunal tissue of ETEC-susceptible pigs (p=0.019). In studies on pig gut microbiota, the presence of intestinal receptors for ETEC should be considered because of their contribution to a reduced bacterial diversity. This effect could be partially reversed by dietary Trp addition.
