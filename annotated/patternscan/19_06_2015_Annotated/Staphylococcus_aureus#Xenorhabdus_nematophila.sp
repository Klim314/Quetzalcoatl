TI  == system wide analysis of the evolution of innate immunity in the nematode model species caenorhabditis elegans and pristionchus pacificus.
AB  == the evolution of genetic mechanisms used to combat bacterial infections is critical for the survival of animals and plants, yet how these genes evolved to produce a robust defense system is poorly understood. studies of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans have uncovered a plethora of genetic regulators and effectors responsible for surviving pathogens. however, comparative studies utilizing other free-living nematodes and therefore providing an insight into the evolution of innate immunity have been lacking. here, we take a systems biology approach and use whole genome microarrays to profile the transcriptional response of c. elegans and the necromenic nematode pristionchus pacificus after exposure to the four different pathogens serratia marcescens, xenorhabdus nematophila, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus thuringiensis db27. c. elegans is susceptible  to all four pathogens whilst p. pacificus is only susceptible to s. marcescens and x. nematophila. we show an unexpected level of specificity in host responses  to distinct pathogens within and across species, revealing an enormous complexity of effectors of innate immunity. functional domains enriched in the transcriptomes on different pathogens are similar within a nematode species but different across them, suggesting differences in pathogen sensing and response networks. we find translation inhibition to be a potentially conserved response to gram-negative pathogens in both the nematodes. further computational analysis  indicates that both nematodes when fed on pathogens up-regulate genes known to be involved in other stress responses like heat shock, oxidative and osmotic stress, and genes regulated by daf-16/foxo and tgf-beta pathways. this study presents a platform for comparative systems analysis of two nematode model species, and a catalog of genes involved in the evolution of nematode immunity and identifies both pathogen specific and pan-pathogen responses. we discuss the potential effects of ecology on evolution of downstream effectors and upstream regulators on evolution of nematode innate immunity.

TI  == xenorhabdus antibiotics: a comparative analysis and potential utility for controlling mastitis caused by bacteria.
AB  == aims: the role of antibiotics produced by bacterial symbionts of entomopathogenic nematodes is to suppress growth of microbes in the soil environment. these antibiotics are active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and were tested against mastitis isolates from dairy cows. methods and results: two bioassays were adapted for xenorhabdus antibiotics; an overlay method on agar plates, and serially diluted, cell-free, xenorhabdus cultures. the antimicrobial  activities of the liquid cultures of 13 strains from five xenorhabdus species were further evaluated. antimicrobial activities of the type strains of x. nematophila, x. budapestensis and x. szentirmaii were tested on mastitis isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae with both bioassays. a previously reported antibiotic from x. nematophila, nematophin, was  synthesized in three steps from tryptamine and 4-methyl-2-oxovaleric acid sodium  salt. conclusions: the antibiotics of all three xenorhabdus strains were powerful in either bioassay, but the sensitivity of the isolates differed from each other. while kl. pneumoniae was the least susceptible, staph. aureus had the highest sensitivity to each xenorhabdus strain. xenorhabdus szentirmaii and x. budapestensis were more potent antibiotic producers than x. nematophila, and raceme nematophin was ineffective against all mastitis isolates. significance and impact of the study: these results indicate that xenorhabdus antibiotics are effective against mastitis isolates and should be further evaluated for their potential in mastitis control or prevention.

TI  == holin locus characterisation from lysogenic xenorhabdus nematophila and its involvement in escherichia coli shea haemolytic phenotype.
AB  == lysogeny has previously been described in the entomopathogenic bacteria of the genus xenorhabdus. screening of a x. nematophila prophage dna library on blood agar resulted in the identification of a 5.7-kb locus that caused a haemolytic phenotype when cloned in escherichia coli, but not in the e. coli shea null mutant, lacking the shea cryptic haemolysin. this locus exhibited similarity to lysis genes from lambdoid phages. in particular, it encoded a functional holin able to complement a lambda sam7 mutant. it is the second time that a locus encoding a functional holin is shown to reveal the shea haemolytic phenotype in e. coli. the possible role of the holin in extracellular release of shea is discussed.
