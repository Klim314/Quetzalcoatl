TI  == coupling the crispr/cas9 system to lambda red recombineering enables simplified chromosomal gene replacement in escherichia coli.
AB  == to date most genetic engineering approaches coupling the type ii streptococcus pyogenes crispr/cas9 system to lambda red recombineering have involved minor single nucleotide mutations. here we show that procedures for carrying out more complex chromosomal gene replacements in escherichia coli can be substantially enhanced through implementation of crispr/cas9 genome editing. we developed a three-plasmid approach that not only allows highly efficient recombination of short single-stranded oligonucleotides, but also replacement of multigene chromosomal stretches of dna with large pcr products. by systematically challenging the proposed system with respect to the magnitude of chromosomal deletion and size of dna insertion, we demonstrated dna deletions of up to 19.4 kb, encompassing 19 non-essential chromosomal genes, and insertion of up to 3 kb  of heterologous dna with recombination efficiencies permitting mutant detection by colony pcr screening. since crispr/cas9-coupled recombineering does not rely on the use of chromosome-encoded antibiotic resistance, nor flippase recombination for antibiotic marker recycling, our approach is simpler, less labor intensive, and allows efficient production of gene replacement mutants that are both markerless and "scar"-less.

TI  == antibacterial activity of native california medicinal plant extracts isolated from rhamnus californica and umbellularia californica.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance (amr) is a major threat to global public health. medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases  by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. rhamnus californica (rhamnaceae) and umbellularia californica (lauraceae) are two indigenous california plant species historically used by native americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. this study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and  u. californica against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. methods: methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of r. and u. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and  evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against bacillus cereus, streptococcus pyogenes, mycobacterium smegmatis, staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, escherichia coli  and pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) assays. chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. results: all extracts inhibited the growth of mrsa and other gram-positive bacteria with mics of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. gram-negative organisms  were unaffected by these extracts. u. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had  the lowest mic values. chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. our  study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of r. and u. californica and illustrates their promising anti-mrsa potential. conclusions: our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of california. further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against mrsa is warranted.

TI  == necrotizing fasciitis: epidemiology and clinical predictors for amputation.
AB  == background: necrotizing fasciitis, a relatively uncommon infection involving the  skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia, is a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection and a medical and surgical urgency. delayed debridement, with subsequent huge soft tissue loss is associated with loss of limb and infection and is the most common cause of mortality. the purpose of this work is to describe the epidemiology of necrotizing fasciitis and to identify the clinical characteristics that may be used to predict amputation in routine clinical practice. methods: retrospective cohort study data were collected from three general hospitals located in the chiang rai, kamphaeng phet, and phayao provinces in northern thailand. epidemiologic data for all patients with a surgically confirmed diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis between 2009 and 2012 were collected. medical records and reviews were retrieved from inpatient records, laboratory reports, and registers. clinical predictors for amputation were analyzed by multivariable risk regression. results: a total of 1,507 patients with a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis were classified as being with amputation (n=127, 8.4%) and without amputation (n=1,380, 91.6%). the most common causative gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were streptococcus pyogenes (33.3% in the amputation group and 40.8% in the non-amputation group) and escherichia coli (25% in the amputation group and 17.1% in the non-amputation group). predictive factors for amputation included gangrene (risk ratio [rr] 4.77, 95% confidence interval [ci] 2.70-8.44), diabetes mellitus (rr 3.08, 95% ci 1.98-4.78), skin necrosis (rr 2.83, 95% ci 2.52-3.18), soft tissue swelling (rr 1.76, 95% ci 1.24-2.49), and serum creatinine values >/=1.6 mg/dl on admission (rr 1.71, 95% ci 1.38-2.12). all data were analyzed using the multivariable risk  regression generalized linear model. conclusion: the most causative pathogens were s. pyogenes and e. coli. clinical predictors for amputation in patients with necrotizing fasciitis included having diabetes mellitus, soft tissue swelling, skin necrosis, gangrene, and serum creatinine values >/=1.6 mg/dl on admission. thus, patients with any of these predictors should be monitored closely for progression and receive early aggressive treatment to avoid limb loss.

TI  == a derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a highly selective against propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a chemical derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a, designated nai003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few gram-positive bacteria. in particular, nai003 retained low mics against all tested isolates of propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, nai003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive p. acnes isolate. gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, nai003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (ef) tu derived from escherichia coli, e. faecalis  or p. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. in contrast, ef-tu's derived from the nai003-insenstitive staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. these results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that nai003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the p. acnes ef-tu. p. acnes mutants resistant to nai003 were isolated by direct plating. with one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding ef-tu. because of its selective effect on p. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, nai003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a phase 1 clinical study.

TI  == [effects of two udp-glucose dehydrogenases on hyaluronic acid biotransformation].
AB  == we amplified genes encoding udp-glucose dehydrogenase, ecohasb from escherichia coli and spyhasb from streptococcus pyogenes. both ecohasb and spyhasb were inserted into t7 expression vector prx2 to construct recombinant plasmids prxeb and prxsb, and to express in e. coli bl21(de3). after nickel column purification  of udp-glucose dehydrogenases, the enzymes were characterized. the optimum reaction condition of spyhasb was at 30 degrees c and ph 10. the specific activity reached 12.2 u/mg under optimum condition. the optimum reaction condition of ecohasb was at 30 degrees c and ph 9. its specific activity reached  5.55 u/mg under optimum condition. the pmuhasa gene encoding hyaluronic acid synthase was amplified from pasteurella multocida and ligated with ecohasb and spyhasb to construct the coexpression vectors pbpaeb and pbpasb, respectively. the co-expression vectors were transformed into e. coli bw25113. hyaluronic acid  (ha) was produced by biotransformation and the conditions were optimized. when recombinant strains were used to produce hyaluronic acid, the higher the activity of udp-glucose dehydrogenase was, the better its stability was, and the higher the ha production could reach. under the optimal conditions, the yields of ha produced by pbpaeb/bw25113 and pbpasb/bw25113 in shake flasks were 1.52 and 1.70  g/l, respectively, and the production increased more than 2-3 folds as previously reported.

TI  == green synthesis and structural characterization of selenium nanoparticles and assessment of their antimicrobial property.
AB  == in the present study, selenium nanoparticles were biologically synthesized by non-pathogenic, economic and easy to handle bacterium ralstonia eutropha. the selenium oxo anion was reduced to selenium nanoparticles in the presence of the bacterium. the bacterium was grown aerobically in the reaction mixture. an extracellular, stable, uniform, spherical selenium nanoparticle was biosynthesized. the tem analysis revealed that the biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles were spherical in shape with size range of 40-120 nm. xrd and saed  analysis showed that nanocrystalline selenium of pure hexagonal phase was synthesized. the formation of actinomorphic trigonal selenium nanorods was also observed. a mechanism of biosynthesis of selenium nanoparticles by r. eutropha was proposed. the biosynthesized selenium nanoparticles were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. selenium nanoparticles  showed excellent antimicrobial activity. the 100, 100, 250 and 100 microg/ml selenium nanoparticles were found to inhibit 99 % growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively. similarly, the 500 microg/ml of selenium nanoparticles was found to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi aspergillus clavatus. the antimicrobial efficacy of selenium nanoparticle was comparable with commercially available antibiotic drug ampicillin.

TI  == comparing seven mitogens with pha-m for improved lymphocyte stimulation in dicentric chromosome analysis for biodosimetry.
AB  == dicentric chromosome analysis (dca) is the gold standard for individual radiation dose estimation. two limiting factors of dca are the time-consuming lymphocyte stimulation and proliferation using the lectin pha-m and the upper dose limit of  individual dose assessment of approximately 4 gy. by measuring the mitotic index  (mi), the authors investigated systematically whether the stimulation of lymphocytes can be improved after administration of alternative (and combined) mitogens. the authors compared the lymphocyte stimulation effectiveness of the traditionally used pha-m (from phaseolus vulgaris) with seven cited mitogens by determination of mis: five lectins namely cna (concanavalin a), pw (pokeweed), lma (maackia amurensis), ltv (t. vulgaris), pha-l (p. vulgaris) as well as lps (lipopolysaccharide, escherichia coli) and slo (streptolysine o, streptococcus pyogenes) were applied. the conventional protocol using pha-m for lymphocyte stimulation proved to be superior over lower/higher pha-m concentrations as well  as seven other mitogens administered either alone or combined with slo or lps.

TI  == development of gendine coated cannula for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for extended use.
AB  == continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (csii) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. one of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of csii is csii set related issues including infection at the infusion site. current american diabetic association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. this adds cost and creates  inconvenience. therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. cannulas were coated with gendine on exterior surface and dried. efficacy and durability of gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for  up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.

TI  == antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  == context: preparations from artocarpus heterophyllus lam. (moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. objective: the objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from a. heterophyllus heartwoods. materials and methods: the dried and powdered a. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. each of the extracts was screened for their  antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. the extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. results and  discussion: the ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against streptococcus mutans, s. pyogenes, and bacillus subtilis with  mic values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/ml, respectively. based on an antibacterial  assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including s. mutans, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis with mics of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8,  8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, and mbcs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against escherichia coli, a gram-negative bacteria with mic and mbc values of 12.9 and 25.8 microm, respectively. only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with an mic of 286.4 microm.

TI  == reduction of lactobacillus in the milks of cows with subclinical mastitis.
AB  == clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis are the most frequent diseases encountered on dairy farms worldwide, which cause significant economic loss and veterinary cost. the mastitic disease status is associated with increases in both milk bacterial pathogens and somatic cell count (scc). although it is well established that the mastitic pathogens generally correlate with the milk scc, to our knowledge, the correlation between the probiotic genus, lactobacillus, and the mastitic causative bacteria and scc have not been determined previously. thus, in this study, milk samples from 12 mild and 28 severe subclinical mastitic dairy cows were collected from the same farm. the overall milk bacterial load was quantified with the total plate count method. the lactobacillus genus and 4 common clinical and subclinical mastitic pathogens (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and trueperella pyogenes) in the sampled milk were enumerated by quantitative pcr. mild and severe subclinical mastitic samples were distinctly separated on the principal component analysis score plot generated based on the quantities of these 5 target bacteria, suggesting that clear differences existed in the microbiological composition between the two sample groups. based on comparison with the pairwise mann-whitney test, the mild subclinical mastitic dairy cows had a significantly higher amounts of lactobacilli (p=0.0175), but lower e. coli (p=0.0002), s. aureus (p<0.0001), s. agalactiae (p=0.0001) and t. pyogenes (p=0.0044) quantities, while an opposite trend occurred in the severe subclinical mastitic group. the negative correlation between lactobacillus and the pathogenic bacteria, as well as the scc, was confirmed with spearman correlation analysis. data generated from the current study may hint to a close relationship between lactobacillus and the health of bovine udder.

TI  == eravacycline (tp-434) is efficacious in animal models of infection.
AB  == eravacycline is a novel broad-spectrum fluorocycline antibiotic being developed for a wide range of serious infections. eravacycline was efficacious in mouse septicemia models, demonstrating 50% protective dose (pd50) values of </= 1 mg/kg of body weight once a day (q.d.) against staphylococcus aureus, including tetracycline-resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), and streptococcus pyogenes. the pd50 values against escherichia coli isolates were 1.2 to 4.4 mg/kg q.d. in neutropenic mouse thigh infection models with methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) and s. pyogenes, eravacycline produced 2 log10 reductions in cfu at single intravenous (i.v.) doses ranging from 0.2 to 9.5 mg/kg. in a neutropenic mouse lung infection model, eravacycline administered i.v. at 10 mg/kg twice a day (b.i.d.) reduced the level of tetracycline-resistant mrsa in the lung equivalent to that of linezolid given orally (p.o.) at 30 mg/kg  b.i.d. at i.v. doses of 3 to 12 mg/kg b.i.d., eravacycline was more efficacious against tetracycline-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae in a neutropenic lung infection model than linezolid p.o. at 30 mg/kg b.i.d. eravacycline showed good efficacy at 2 to 10 mg/kg i.v. b.i.d., producing up to a 4.6 log10 cfu reduction  in kidney bacterial burden in a model challenged with a uropathogenic e. coli isolate. eravacycline was active in multiple murine models of infection against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == bacterial adhesion force quantification by fluidic force microscopy.
AB  == quantification of detachment forces between bacteria and substrates facilitates the understanding of the bacterial adhesion process that affects cell physiology  and survival. here, we present a method that allows for serial, single bacterial  cell force spectroscopy by combining the force control of atomic force microscopy with microfluidics. reversible bacterial cell immobilization under physiological  conditions on the pyramidal tip of a microchanneled cantilever is achieved by underpressure. using the fluidic force microscopy technology (fluidfm), we achieve immobilization forces greater than those of state-of-the-art cell-cantilever binding as demonstrated by the detachment of escherichia coli from polydopamine with recorded forces between 4 and 8 nn for many cells. the contact time and setpoint dependence of the adhesion forces of e. coli and streptococcus pyogenes, as well as the sequential detachment of bacteria out of a chain, are shown, revealing distinct force patterns in the detachment curves. this study demonstrates the potential of the fluidfm technology for quantitative  bacterial adhesion measurements of cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions that are relevant in biofilms and infection biology.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the percentage of participation of particular species of microorganisms, isolated from the uterus of cows with endometritis and from cows without inflammatory lesions of the uterus, in the same postpartum period. the aim of the study was also to examine how long after parturition non-treated endometritis persists. moreover, antibiotic susceptibility tests were carried out of the bacterial isolates dominating in the uterus. forty cows were included in the study: 20 cows with endometritis (experimental group) and 20 cows without any inflammatory condition of the uterus (control group). the material for cytological and bacteriological tests was collected on the 5th, 26th, 40th and 60th day after parturition, using an intrauterine brush adapted for cows. the total number of collected isolates was 149, including 120 isolates from the uterus of cows with endometritis and 29 isolates from the uterus of cows without endometritis. the following species of microorganisms were isolated from the material collected from cows with endometritis: t. pyogenes (49.2%), e.coli (22.5%), f. necrophorum (11.7%), staphylococcus sp. (6.7%), b. melaninogenicus (5.8%), and streptococcus sp. (4.1%). the participation percentage of particular species of bacteria in the material collected from the uterus of cows without endometritis was as follows: t. pyogenes (27.6%), e.coli (24.2%), staphylococcus sp. (20.7%), streptococcus sp. (20.7%), b. melaninogenicus (3.4%) and f. necrophorum (3.4%). the highest percentage of t. pyogenes isolates was susceptible to ceftiofur (89.6%); cefoperazone (85.1%) and amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid (79.1%). e. coli isolates were most susceptible to amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid  (100%), cefoperazone (94.1%) and oxytetracycline (82.3%).

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of monarda punctata essential oil  and its main components against common bacterial pathogens in respiratory tract.
AB  == the aim of the current research work was to study the chemical composition of the essential oil of monarda punctata along with evaluating the essential oil and its major components for their antibacterial effects against some frequently encountered respiratory infection causing pathogens. gas chromatographic mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of 13 chemical constituents with thymol (75.2%), p-cymene (6.7%), limonene (5.4), and carvacrol (3.5%) as the major constituents. the oil composition was dominated by the oxygenated monoterpenes. antibacterial activity of the essential oil and its major constituents (thymol, p-cymene, limonene) was evaluated against streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli. the study revealed that  the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against different strains. among the tested strains, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae were the most susceptible bacterial strain showing lowest mic and mbc values. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was the most resistant bacterial strain to the essential oil treatment showing relatively higher mic and mbc values. scanning electron microscopy revealed that the essential oil induced potent and dose-dependent membrane damage in s. pyogenes and mrsa bacterial strains. the reactive oxygen species generated by the monarda punctata essential  oil were identified using 2', 7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (dcfda).this study indicated that the monarda punctata essential oil to a great extent and thymol to a lower extent triggered a substantial increase in the ros levels in s. pyogenes  bacterial cultures which ultimately cause membrane damage as revealed by sem results.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils of pinus peuce (pinaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils isolated from twigs with needles (t+n) and from twigs without needles (t-n) from  wild pinus peuce griseb. (pinaceae), from three different locations in r. macedonia, were investigated. essential oil yields of t+n ranged from 7.5 ml/kg to 12.5 ml/kg and for t-n from 13.8 ml/kg to 17.3 ml/kg. gc/fid/ms analysis of the essential oils revealed eighty-four components, representing 93.7-95.7% and 91.2-92.0% of the t+n and t-n oils, respectively. the major components in t+n and t-n oils were monoterpenes: alpha-pinene (23.8-39.9%, 21.2-23.3%), camphene (2.2-5.5%, 0.7-2.0%), beta-pinene (10.1-17.1%, 8.2-16.4%), myrcene (1.2-1.41%, 1.6-2.5%), limonene+beta-phellandrene (6.8-14.0%, 8.8-23.6%) and bornyl acetate (2.3-6.9%, 1.1-3.4%), followed by the sesquiterpenes: trans-(e)-caryophyllene (3.6-4.3%, 3.2-7.3%), germacrene d (7.1-9.5%, 5.0-10.3%) and delta-cadinene (2.1-3.1%, 3.3-4.2%, respectively). antimicrobial screening of the essential oils was made by disk diffusion and broth dilution methods against 13 bacterial isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and one strain of candida albicans. t-n essential oils showed antimicrobial activity toward streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans as well as streptococcus agalactiae, acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae. the antimicrobial activity of t+n essential oils was greater, especially against streptococcus agalactiae, s. pyogenes, enterococcus and candida albicans, followed by haemophilus influenzae, acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of all tested essential oils ranged from 15-125  mul/ml. summarizing the obtained results, the antimicrobial activity of pinus peuce t+n and t-n essential oils collected from different localities in r. macedonia varied considerably. these alterations in the antimicrobial activity can be attributed to the differences in the quantitative composition and percentage amounts of the components present in the respective essential oils, although it was evident that there were no differences in the qualitative composition of the essential oils, regardless of the locality of collection, or the type of plant material (t+n or t-n).

TI  == antibacterial activity and mode of action of the artemisia capillaris essential oil and its constituents against respiratory tract infection-causing pathogens.
AB  == inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute and chronic  sinusitis and bronchitis. the aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of artemisia capillaris, and evaluate the antibacterial effects of the essential oil and its main components, against common clinically relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens. gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed the presence of 25 chemical constituents, the main constituents being: alphapinene, betapinene, limonene, 1,8cineole, piperitone, betacaryophyllene and capillin. the antibacterial activities of the essential oil, and its major constituents, were evaluated against streptococcus pyogenes, methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), mrsa (clinical strain), methicillingentamicin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mgrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli. the essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. the essential oil was observed to be much more potent, as compared with any of its major chemical constituents, exhibiting low minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentration values against all of the bacterial strains. the essential oil was most active against s. pyogenes, mrsa (clinical strain), s. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae and e. coli. piperitone and  capillin were the most potent growth inhibitors, among the major chemical constituents. furthermore, the essential oil of a. capillaris induced significant and dosedependent morphological changes in the s. aureus bacterial strain, killing >90% of the bacteria when administered at a higher dose; as determined by scanning electron microscopy. in addition, the essential oil induced a significant leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from the s. aureus bacterial  cultures. these results indicate that the antibacterial action of a. capillaris essential oil may be mediated through the leakage of these two important ions. in conclusion, a. capillaris essential oil exhibits potent antibacterial activity by inducing morphological changes and leakage of ions in s. aureus bacterial cultures.

TI  == diversity and health status specific fluctuations of intrauterine microbial communities in postpartum dairy cows.
AB  == for the interpretation of clinical findings of endometritis and the development of disease prevention and intervention strategies a better understanding of the dynamics and interactions within intrauterine bacterial communities in healthy and diseased cows is required. to gain deeper insights into fluctuations within the uterine microbiota, intrauterine samples were collected from 122 cows at the  day of calving, days 3, 9, 15, 21 and 28 postpartum. a total of 2052 bacterial isolates were identified by fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy. this culturomics-based approach showed that the aerobic uterine microflora comprised a huge diversity of bacteria belonging to 202 different species, representing 76 genera, with members of the genus staphylococcus (24.2%) being predominant. on species level the uterine microflora was dominated by trueperella pyogenes (13.2%), escherichia coli (11.2%), staphylococcus xylosus (5.4%), bacillus pumilus (5.2%) and streptococcus uberis (4.9%). comparative analysis of uterine bacteria from cows with different vaginal discharge scores (vds) revealed health  status specific temporal microbial diversifications. although the intrauterine flora of all vds groups was dominated by t. pyogenes, e. coli and staphylococcus  spp., the relative number of bacteria differed between vds groups. the presence of t. pyogenes on days 15 and 21 significantly increased the risk of vds 2 and 3  at day 21, whereas staphylococci at day 9 reduced the likelihood of vds 3 (p<0.05). this study demonstrates that intrauterine bacterial infections are highly dynamic processes and that bacterial species follow specific patterns of progression, which require further research to decipher their potential role in uterine disease development.

TI  == dynamics of uterine infections with escherichia coli, streptococcus uberis and trueperella pyogenes in post-partum dairy cows and their association with clinical endometritis.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the uterine microbiota of dairy cows are poorly understood although it is becoming increasingly evident that they play a crucial  role in the development of metritis and endometritis. fourier-transform infrared  (ftir) spectroscopy was used to monitor the bovine microbiota of 40 cows on the day of calving and days 3, 9, 15, and 21 after parturition, and to investigate the associations of selected species with clinical endometritis (ce). trueperella pyogenes (43.5%), escherichia coli (21.5%), bacillus spp. (21.0%) and streptococcus uberis (18.5%) were the most frequently isolated microbes. analyses of different sampling time points revealed that the presence of s. uberis on day  3 increased the risk of subsequent t. pyogenes infection on day 9 (odds ratio [or] = 5.1, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.2-22.6). t. pyogenes infection (or = 36.0, 95% ci = 3.8-343.2) and retained fetal membranes (rfm) (or = 12.4, 95%ci =  1.4-112.7) were significant risk factors for ce. cows with s. uberis on day 3 tended to have greater odds of ce than s. uberis-negative cows (or = 7.1, 95% ci  = 0.9-55.6). chemometric analysis revealed significant differences in the metabolic profile of s. uberis strains isolated from cows with different vaginal  discharge scores. this is the first study showing the association of specific s.  uberis subtypes with the uterine health status of post-partum dairy cows. the study demonstrates that uterine clearance is a highly dynamic process, during which time bacteria show distinct patterns of progression, and provides information about interactions between bacterial species involved in the occurrence of ce.

TI  == the salivary scavenger and agglutinin in early life: diverse roles in amniotic fluid and in the infant intestine.
AB  == the salivary scavenger and agglutinin (salsa), also known as gp340 and dmbt1, is  an antimicrobial and inflammation-regulating molecule located at the mucosal surfaces. the present study revealed that salsa was present in the amniotic fluid (af) and exceptionally enriched in both meconium and feces of infants. based on immunological and mass spectrometric analysis, salsa was estimated to constitute  up to 4-10% of the total protein amount in meconium, making it one of the most abundant proteins. salsa proteins in the af and intestinal samples were polymorphic and exhibited varying polypeptide compositions. in particular, a different abundance of peptides corresponding to functionally important structures was found in the af and intestinal salsa. the af form of salsa had a more intact structure and contained peptides from the zona pellucida domain, which is involved in cell differentiation and oligomerization. in contrast, the intestinal salsa was more enriched with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains. the af, but not the meconium salsa, bound to streptococcus pyogenes, s.  agalactiae, s. gordonii, and escherichia coli. furthermore, differential binding  was observed also to known endogenous ligands c1q, mannose-binding lectin, and secretory iga. our results have thus identified mucosal body compartments, where  salsa is particularly abundant, and suggest that salsa exhibits varying functions in the different mucosal locations. the high levels of salsa in af and the infant intestine suggest a robust and important function for salsa during the fetal development and in the mucosal innate immune defense of infants.

TI  == charge requirements of lipid ii flippase activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == peptidoglycan (pg) is an extracytoplasmic glycopeptide matrix essential for the integrity of the envelope of most bacteria. the pg building block is a disaccharide-pentapeptide that is synthesized as a lipid-linked precursor called  lipid ii. the translocation of the amphipathic lipid ii across the cytoplasmic membrane is required for subsequent incorporation of the disaccharide-pentapeptide into pg. in escherichia coli, the essential inner membrane protein murj is the lipid ii flippase. previous studies showed that 8 charged residues in the central cavity region of murj are crucial for function. here, we completed the functional analysis of all 57 charged residues in murj and demonstrated that the respective positive or negative charge of the 8 aforementioned residues is required for proper murj function. loss of the negative charge in one of these residues, d39, causes a severe defect in murj biogenesis; by engineering an intragenic suppressor mutation that restores murj biogenesis, we found that this charge is also essential for murj function. because of the low level of homology between murj and putative orthologs from gram-positive bacteria, we explored the conservation of these 8 charged residues  in ytgp, a homolog from streptococcus pyogenes. we found that only 3 positive charges are similarly positioned and essential in ytgp; ytgp possesses additional charged residues within its predicted cavity that are essential for function and  conserved among gram-positive bacteria. from these data, we hypothesize that some charged residues in the cavity region of murj homologs are required for interaction with lipid ii and/or energy coupling during transport.

TI  == monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis in a single center: the emergence of gram-negative bacteria as a common pathogen.
AB  == background: necrotizing fasciitis (nf) is a life-threatening soft tissue infection. it is usually caused by streptococcus pyogenes and other gram-positive bacteria. several reports, however, emphasize the importance of gram-negative rods in this infection. methods: we retrospectively studied all cases of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis hospitalized in our center during the years 2002-2012. we compared clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with gram-negative versus gram-positive infection. results: forty-five cases were reviewed, 19 caused by gram-negative organisms, 10 of them escherichia coli, and  26 caused by gram-positive organisms, 10 of them s. pyogenes. compared to gram-positive infections, patients with gram-negative infections were more likely to have a baseline malignancy (9/19, 47.4%) or to have undergone recent surgery (4/19, 42.3%). the 30-day mortality was higher among gram-negative infected patients (8/19, 42.1% vs. 8/26, 30.8%). creatine phosphokinase (cpk) was elevated in a minority of patients with gram-negative necrotizing fasciitis, and its absolute value was lower than in gram-positive necrotizing fasciitis. conclusions: in our center, 42% of monomicrobial necrotizing fasciitis cases were found to be caused by gram-negative organisms, mostly e. coli. these infections usually appeared in immunocompromised or postoperative patients, often presented  with normal cpk levels, and were associated with high mortality rates.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides are highly abundant and active in postoperative pleural drainage fluids.
AB  == background: the human lung is considered a nonsterile organ, and surgical interventions therefore take place in a more or less contaminated operating field. nevertheless, infectious complications of the pleural cavity are low after major lung resections. antimicrobial peptides (amps) are part of the innate immunity and display a broad capacity to kill pathogens. we hypothesized that the pleural space must have a high natural antimicrobial barrier and that amps might  effectively protect the pleural cavity. methods: pleural effusions were collected after lung operations. antimicrobial activity of the fluids against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens was analyzed by microdilution assays. amps were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and immunohistochemical analysis. the impact of proinflammatory triggers on amp release from pleural mesothelial cells was evaluated. results: antimicrobial activity assays revealed high bactericidal properties of postoperative pleural drainage fluids. they effectively killed gram-negative pathogens (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) as well as gram-positive pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes). a variety of amps was detected at constantly high concentrations in the pleural fluids. they mainly derived from leukocytes and pleural epithelium. although proinflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in the postoperative pleural fluids, amp expression could not be augmented by toll-like receptor (tlr) triggering or by the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (il)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)alpha. conclusions: we provide the first evidence of a high  abundance of amps in postoperative pleural fluids. our findings might explain the broad protection against infectious complications of the pleural space after major lung operations.

AB  == the incorporation of a metal ion, with antimicrobial activity, into an alginate dressing is an attractive approach to minimize infection in a wound. in this work, copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels were successfully prepared using a two-step cross-linking procedure. in the first step, solid alginate films were prepared using a solvent-casting method from soft gels of alginate solutions that had been lightly cross-linked using a copper (ii) (cu(2+)) sulfate solution. in the second step, the films were further cross-linked in a corresponding cu(2+) sulfate solution using a dipping method to further improve their dimensional stability. alginate solution (at 2%w/v) and cu(2+) sulfate solution (at 2%w/v) in acetate buffer at a low ph provided soft films with excellent swelling behavior.  an increase in either cu(2+) ion concentration or cross-linking time led to hydrogels with more densely-cross-linked networks that limited water absorption.  the hydrogels clearly showed antibacterial activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes, which was proportional to  the cu(2+) ion concentration. blood coagulation studies showed that the tested copper (ii) cross-linked alginate hydrogels had a tendency to coagulate fibrin, and possibly had an effect on pro-thrombotic coagulation and platelet activation. conclusively, the prepared films are likely candidates as antibacterial wound dressings.

TI  == subclinical pulmonary pathogenic infection in camels slaughtered in cairo, egypt.
AB  == introduction: camels migrate between the open boundaries of sudan and egypt either for grazing or for slaughtering. bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. this study investigated whether camels slaughtered in cairo carried pulmonary infections. methodology: five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. results: a total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), escherichia coli (27.14%), klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), bacillus spp. (25.72%), streptococcus pyogenes (10%), corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. conclusions: a considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. if adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.

TI  == hospitalist perspective on the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections.
AB  == the prevalence of skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) has been increasing in  the united states. these infections are associated with an increase in hospital admissions. hospitalists play an increasingly important role in the management of these infections and need to use hospital resources efficiently and effectively.  when available, observation units are useful for treating low-risk patients who do not require hospital admission. imaging tools may help to exclude abscesses and necrotizing soft tissue infections; however, surgical exploration remains the principal means of diagnosing necrotizing soft tissue infections. the most common pathogens that cause sstis are streptococci and staphylococcus aureus. methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) is a prevalent pathogen, and concerns are increasing regarding the unclear distinctions between community-acquired and hospital-acquired mrsa. other less frequent pathogens that cause sstis include enterococcus species, escherichia coli, klebsiella species, enterobacter species, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. cephalexin and clindamycin are suitable options for infections caused by streptococcal species and methicillin-susceptible s aureus.  the increasing resistance of s aureus and streptococcus pyogenes to erythromycin  limits its use in these infections, and better alternatives are available. parenteral cefazolin, nafcillin, or oxacillin can be used in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis caused by streptococci and methicillin-susceptible s aureus. when oral mrsa therapy is indicated, clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or linezolid is appropriate. vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, telavancin, and ceftaroline fosamil are intravenous options that should be used in mrsa infections that require patient hospitalization. in the treatment of patients with sstis, hospitalists are at the forefront of providing proper patient care that reduces hospital costs, duration of therapy, and therapeutic failures. this  review updates guidelines on the management of sstis with a focus on infections caused by s aureus, particularly mrsa, and outlines the role of the hospitalist in the effective management of sstis.

TI  == effects of natural honey on polymicrobial culture of various human pathogens.
AB  == introduction: honey has a wide range of antimicrobial activity. all previous studies have considered honey's effect on a single microbe. the present study investigated activity of honey towards a high dose of single or polymicrobial culture. material and methods: 10 microl specimens of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes), escherichia coli (e. coli) and candida albicans (c. albicans) were cultured in 10 ml of 10-100% (wt/v) honey diluted in broth. six types of polymicrobial microbial cultures were prepared by  culturing the isolates with each other onto broth (control) and broth containing  various concentrations of honey (10-100% wt/v). microbial growth was assessed on  solid plate media after 24 h incubation. results: honey (30-70%) prevents growth  of 10 microl specimens of all the isolates. greater reduction in growth of e. coli was observed when cultured with s. aureus. culturing of s. aureus with s. pyogenes, c. albicans, or e. coli increased its sensitivity to honey. s. aureus and s. pyogenes increased sensitivity of c. albicans to honey while e. coli and c. albicans decreased sensitivity of s. pyogenes. conclusions: it might be concluded that honey prevents and inhibits growth of single and polymicrobial pathogenic cultures. polymicrobial culture affects growth of the isolates and increases their sensitivity to honey.

TI  == crispr/cas9-mediated phage resistance is not impeded by the dna modifications of  phage t4.
AB  == bacteria rely on two known dna-level defenses against their bacteriophage predators: restriction-modification and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-crispr-associated (cas) systems. certain phages have evolved countermeasures that are known to block endonucleases. for example, phage t4 not only adds hydroxymethyl groups to all of its cytosines, but also glucosylates them, a strategy that defeats almost all restriction enzymes. we sought to determine whether these dna modifications can similarly impede crispr-based defenses. in a bioinformatics search, we found naturally occurring crispr spacers that potentially target phages known to modify their dna. experimentally, we show that the cas9 nuclease from the type ii crispr system of  streptococcus pyogenes can overcome a variety of dna modifications in escherichia coli. the levels of cas9-mediated phage resistance to bacteriophage t4 and the mutant phage t4 gt, which contains hydroxymethylated but not glucosylated cytosines, were comparable to phages with unmodified cytosines, t7 and the t4-like phage rb49. our results demonstrate that cas9 is not impeded by n6-methyladenine, 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylated cytosine, or glucosylated 5-hydroxymethylated cytosine.

AB  == the streptokinase (sk) is emerging as an important thrombolytic therapy agent in  the treatment of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. we reported highly effective renaturation of a sk from s. pyogeness dt7 overexpressed in e. coli, purification, and biochemical characterization. a gene coding for the sk was cloned from s. pyogeness dt7. because accumulation of active sk is toxic to the host cells, we have expressed it in the form of inclusion bodies. the mature  protein was overexpressed in e. coli bl21 de3/pesk under the control of the strong promoter tac induced by iptg with a level of 60% of the total cell proteins. the activity of the rsk, renatured in phosphate buffer supplemented with triton x-100 and glycerol, was covered with up to 41 folds of its initial activity. the purified of protein was identified with maldi-tof mass spectrometry through four peptide fragments, which showed 100% identification to the corresponding peptides of the putative sk from genbank. due to overexpression and highly effective renaturation of large amounts of inclusion bodies, the recombinant e. coli bl21 de3/pesk system could be potentially applied for large-scale production of sk used in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  == recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. these well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to  their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. according to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (amps) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. amps can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. the purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. to do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: citropin 1.1, lipopeptides palm-kk-nh2 and palm-rr-nh2, omiganan, pexiganan and temporin a. antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed  by reference strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis) bacteria. amps exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive strains, while gram-negative  bacteria were less susceptible. antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as  compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.

TI  == characterization of hyaluronic acid specific hyaluronate lyase (hylp) from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is associated with a wide variety of mucosal and invasive  infections that claim human life. the conversion from non pathogenic to toxigenic strain of s. pyogenes are thought to be mediated by bacteriophage infection in several cases. the hyaluronic acid (ha) degrading enzyme hyaluronate lyase (hl) is proposed to be one of the key bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors. in the  present work, hl of s. pyogenes bacteriophage h4489a (hylp) was expressed in escherichia coli, purified and their structural and functional properties were studied. the enzyme exists in an extended trimeric conformation whose function is influenced by calcium ions. the collagenous gly-x-y motif of the enzyme influences stability and interact with calcium ions suggesting its role in the enzyme regulation the hylp shows sequential unfolding through the n-terminal domain. the primary catalytic residues of the enzyme seem to be in the first pocket consisting of asp170 and tyr182; however the enzyme activity is considerably reduced with mutation in the second pocket consisting of glu295 and  tyr298. the catalytic residues span between the regions containing 135-308 amino  acids where both the catalytic pocket has a prominent positively charged residue. the net positive potential of the cleft may help in recruiting the negatively charged polymeric ha. interestingly, unlike other phage hls, hylp is inhibited by l-ascorbic through non competitive manner.

TI  == bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria.
AB  == background: pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. the disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. pid is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. this situation is not in any way different here in nigeria and more so in the federal capital territory, abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on pid. it therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. materials and methods: endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), attending some hospitals in abuja, nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. results: out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. organisms encountered were  staphylococcus aureus (16%), escherichia coli (10%), streptococcus faecalis (8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), streptococcus pyogenes (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), proteus rettgeri (2%) and proteus mirabilis (1%). the highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). the age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). there was a significant difference in the acquisition of pid in relation to marital status (p < 0.05). however there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (p > 0.05). antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of pid due to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. conclusion: in conclusion, pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. pid is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. there is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. pid hence can be said to be a very serious  complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. the right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation.  treatment of pid should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with pid, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.

TI  == spyligase peptide-peptide ligation polymerizes affibodies to enhance magnetic cancer cell capture.
AB  == individual proteins can now often be modified with atomic precision, but there are still major obstacles to connecting proteins into larger assemblies. to direct protein assembly, ideally, peptide tags would be used, providing the minimal perturbation to protein function. however, binding to peptides is generally weak, so assemblies are unstable over time and disassemble with force or harsh conditions. we have recently developed an irreversible protein-peptide interaction (spytag/spycatcher), based on a protein domain from streptococcus pyogenes, that locks itself together via spontaneous isopeptide bond formation. here we develop irreversible peptide-peptide interaction, through redesign of this domain and genetic dissection into three parts: a protein domain termed spyligase, which now ligates two peptide tags to each other. all components expressed efficiently in escherichia coli and peptide tags were reactive at the n terminus, at the c terminus, or at internal sites. peptide-peptide ligation enabled covalent and site-specific polymerization of affibodies or antibodies against the tumor markers epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and her2. magnetic capture of circulating tumor cells (ctcs) is one of the most promising approaches to improve cancer prognosis and management, but ctc capture is limited by inefficient recovery of cells expressing low levels of tumor antigen. spyligase-assembled protein polymers made possible the isolation of cancerous cells expressing lower levels of tumor antigen and should have general application in enhancing molecular capture.

TI  == preparation and antimicrobial action of three tryptic digested functional molecules of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == lactoferrin is an 80 kda bilobal, iron binding glycoprotein which is primarily antimicrobial in nature. the hydrolysis of lactoferrin by various proteases in the gut produces several functional fragments of lactoferrin which have varying molecular sizes and properties. here, bovine lactoferrin has been hydrolyzed by trypsin, the major enzyme present in the gut, to produce three functional molecules of sizes approximately 21 kda, 38 kda and 45 kda. the molecules have been purified using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and identified using n-terminal sequencing, which reveals that while the 21 kda molecule corresponds to the n2 domain (21lf), the 38 kda represents the whole c-lobe (38lf) and the 45 kda is a portion of n1 domain of n-lobe attached to the c-lobe  (45lf). the iron binding and release properties of 21lf, 38lf and 45lf have been  studied and compared. the sequence and structure analysis of the portions of the  excision sites of lf from various species have been done. the antibacterial properties of these three molecules against bacterial strains, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes were investigated. the antifungal action of the molecules was also evaluated against candida albicans. this is the first report on the antimicrobial actions of the trypsin cleaved functional molecules of lactoferrin from any species.

AB  == a total of 160 genitalia of camels and cows were investigated in maiduguri, north-eastern nigeria to compare bacterial isolates and the antibacterial susceptibilities of some of the isolates. streptococcus (str.) pyogenes (31%), escherichia (e.) coli (24%) and staphylococcus (s.) aureus (20%) were the most common vaginal bacterial isolates in camels; while e. coli (73%), str. pyogenes (18%) and s. aureus (11%) were the most frequent isolates in the cows. of the 78  uterine isolates recovered in this study, e. coli was the most prominent in camels (8%) and cows (54%). the overall weight of genital infection in all camels and cows examined was highest (p < 0.05) with e. coli (79%), but there was no difference (p > 0.05) between vaginal and uterine bacterial isolates from camels  and cows in this study. the relative risk (rr) for an infection of the vagina with e coli (3.04, 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.104 to 4.398, p < 0.0001) is more in cows compared to the camel, but the rr for vaginal infection with s. aureus and str. pyogenes were lower in cows compared to camels. the e. coli and s. aureus isolates were highly susceptible to the antimicrobial agents tested. therefore effective management of reproductive disorders associated with these pathogens can be achieved with proper use of these antimicrobial agents in these  animal species.

TI  == optimal insemination and replacement decisions to minimize the cost of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == mastitis is a serious production-limiting disease, with effects on milk yield, milk quality, and conception rate, and an increase in the risk of mortality and culling. the objective of this study was 2-fold: (1) to develop an economic optimization model that incorporates all the different types of pathogens that cause clinical mastitis (cm) categorized into 8 classes of culture results, and account for whether the cm was a first, second, or third case in the current lactation and whether the cow had a previous case or cases of cm in the preceding lactation; and (2) to develop this decision model to be versatile enough to add additional pathogens, diseases, or other cow characteristics as more information  becomes available without significant alterations to the basic structure of the model. the model provides economically optimal decisions depending on the individual characteristics of the cow and the specific pathogen causing cm. the net returns for the basic herd scenario (with all cm included) were $507/cow per  year, where the incidence of cm (cases per 100 cow-years) was 35.6, of which 91.8% of cases were recommended for treatment under an optimal replacement policy. the cost per case of cm was $216.11. the cm cases comprised (incidences,  %) staphylococcus spp. (1.6), staphylococcus aureus (1.8), streptococcus spp. (6.9), escherichia coli (8.1), klebsiella spp. (2.2), other treated cases (e.g.,  pseudomonas; 1.1), other not treated cases (e.g., trueperella pyogenes; 1.2), and negative culture cases (12.7). the average cost per case, even under optimal decisions, was greatest for klebsiella spp. ($477), followed by e. coli ($361), other treated cases ($297), and other not treated cases ($280). this was followed by the gram-positive pathogens; among these, the greatest cost per case was due to staph. aureus ($266), followed by streptococcus spp. ($174) and staphylococcus spp. ($135); negative culture had the lowest cost ($115). the model recommended treatment for most cm cases (>85%); the range was 86.2% (klebsiella spp.) to 98.5% (staphylococcus spp.). in general, the optimal recommended time for replacement was up to 5 mo earlier for cows with cm compared with cows without cm. furthermore, although the parameter estimates implemented in this model are applicable to the dairy farms in this study, the parameters may be altered to be  specific to other dairy farms. cow rankings and values based on disease status, pregnancy status, and milk production can be extracted; these provide guidance when determining which cows to keep or cull.

AB  == purpose: candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that is commonly found in  human microflora. biofilm formation (bf) is known as a major virulence factor of  c. albicans. the aim of this study was to examine the influence of bacterial presence on biofilm formation of c. albicans. materials and methods: the bf of candida was investigated when it was co-cultured with c. albicans (c. albicans 53, a yeast with a low bf ability, and c. albicans 163, a yeast with high bf ability) and bacteria. bf was assessed with xtt reduction assay. a scanning electron microscope was used to determine the structure of the biofilm, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify and quantify hyphae-associated genes. results: co-culturing with two different types  of bacteria increased the bf value. co-culturing with c. albicans 53 and 163 also increased the bf value compared to the value that was obtained when the c. albicans was cultured individually. however, co-culturing with bacteria decreased the bf value of c. albicans, and the bf of c. albicans 163 was markedly inhibited. the expression of adherence and morphology transition related genes were significantly inhibited by co-culturing with live bacteria. conclusion: bacteria have a negative effect on the formation of biofilm by c. albicans. this  mechanism is the result of the suppression of genes associated with the hyphae transition of c. albicans, and bacteria particles physically affected the biofilm architecture and biofilm formation.

TI  == ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary latin american bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  == a total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 latin american medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory  and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. a total of 30.0% of isolates  were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. ceftaroline was active against staphylococcus aureus (42.8% mrsa) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/l and all isolates at </= 2 mg/l (mic5090, 0.25/2mg/l). national mrsa rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in colombia to a high of 68.1% in chile. all streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/l for both). all streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline  and vancomycin. susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (clsi non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (clsi meningitis interpretive criteria) for all  s. pneumoniae. ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (clsi non-meningitis  interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (clsi meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin mic, 4 mg/l) strains. all haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. for the latin american region, the esbl-phenotype rate was 37.6% for escherichia coli and 53.3% for klebsiella pneumoniae. ceftaroline was not active against esbl-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-esbl-phenotype. the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from latin america indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the latin american region.

TI  == montmorillonite-chitosan-silver sulfadiazine nanocomposites for topical treatment of chronic skin lesions: in vitro biocompatibility, antibacterial efficacy and gap closure cell motility properties.
AB  == silver compounds and especially silver sulfadiazine (agsd) are reported as effective antimicrobial agents against almost all known bacteria, fungi and some  viruses. however, agsd has been shown to be cytotoxic toward fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro and consequently to retard wound healing in vivo. the aim  of the present work was to evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility (cytotoxicity and proliferation), antimicrobial efficacy and cell motility gap closure (assay of wound closure) of mt/cs nanocomposites loaded with silver sulfadiazine (agsd). it is envisioned to be administered as a powder or a dressing for cutaneous application in the treatment of skin ulcers. the loading of agsd in mt/cs nanocomposites aimed at preventing the delay in wound healing, by decreasing the  cytotoxicity of agsd and maintaining its antimicrobial properties. nanocomposites were prepared by using different amounts of mt (100-2000 mg) and 40 ml of a 1% (w/w) chitosan glutamate aqueous solution. the relative amounts of agsd and chitosan in the systems were assessed by suitable analytic methods. the nanocomposite prepared using 100mg of mt was characterized for in vitro biocompatibility and proliferation and for wound healing using normal human dermal fibroblasts (nhdf). antimicrobial properties were evaluated against four reference bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. agsd loaded in the 100 mt/cs nanocomposite showed good in vitro biocompatibility and gap closure properties (fibroblasts) and maintained agsd antimicrobial properties, especially against p. aeruginosa, that often complicates skin lesions.

TI  == the clpxp protease is responsible for the degradation of the epsilon antidote to  the zeta toxin of the streptococcal psm19035 plasmid.
AB  == most bacterial genomes contain different types of toxin-antitoxin (ta) systems. the omega-epsilon-zeta proteinaceous type ii ta cassette from the streptococcal psm19035 plasmid is a member of the epsilon/zeta family, which is commonly found  in multiresistance plasmids and chromosomes of various human pathogens. regulation of type ii ta systems relies on the proteolysis of antitoxin proteins. under normal conditions, the epsilon antidote neutralizes the zeta toxin through  the formation of a tight complex. in this study, we show, using both in vivo and  in vitro analyses, that the clpxp protease is responsible for epsilon antitoxin degradation. using in vivo studies, we examined the stability of the plasmids with active or inactive omega-epsilon-zeta ta cassettes in b. subtilis mutants that were defective for different proteases. using in vitro assays, the degradation of purified his6-epsilon by the his6-lonbs, clppbs, and clpxbs proteases from b. subtilis was analyzed. additionally, we showed that purified zeta toxin protects the epsilon protein from rapid clpxp-catalyzed degradation.

TI  == pathogen-specific effects on milk yield in repeated clinical mastitis episodes in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) cases due to different pathogens on milk yield in holstein cows. the first 3 cm cases in a cow's lactation were modeled. eight categories of pathogens were included: streptococcus spp.; staphylococcus aureus; coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns); escherichia coli; klebsiella spp.; cases with cm signs but no bacterial growth (above the level detectable by our microbiological procedures) observed in the culture sample, and cases with contamination (>/= 3 pathogens in the sample); other pathogens that may be treated with antibiotics (included citrobacter, corynebacterium bovis, enterobacter, enterococcus, pasteurella, pseudomonas; "other treatable"); and other pathogens not successfully treated with antibiotics (trueperella pyogenes, mycoplasma, prototheca, yeasts; "other not treatable"). data from 38,276 lactations in cows from 5 new york state dairy herds, collected from 2003-2004 until 2011, were analyzed. mixed models with an autoregressive correlation structure (to account for correlation among the repeated measures of milk yield within a lactation) were estimated. primiparous (lactation 1) and multiparous (lactations 2 and 3) cows were analyzed separately, as the shapes of their lactation curves differed.  primiparas were followed for up to 48 wk of lactation and multiparas for up to 44 wk. fixed effects included parity, calving season, week of lactation, cm (type, case number, and timing of cm in relation to milk production cycle), and other diseases (milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum).  herd was modeled as a random effect. clinical mastitis was more common in multiparas than in primiparas. in primiparas, streptococcus spp. occurred most frequently as the first case. in multiparas, e. coli was most common as the first case. in subsequent cases, cm cases with no specific growth or contamination were most common in both parity groups. the hazard of cm increased with case number. mastitic cows were generally higher producers before the cm episode than their nonmastitic herdmates. milk loss varied with pathogen and case number. in primiparas, the greatest losses were associated with e. coli and "other not treatable" organisms. in multiparas, the greatest losses were associated with klebsiella spp. and "other not treatable" organisms. milk loss was not associated with occurrence of cns. the findings may help farmers to make optimal management  decisions for their cows.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == the prevalence of bacteremia in pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia: guidelines to reduce the frequency of obtaining blood cultures.
AB  == objective: the goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacteremia in pediatric patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) at our institution  and to test the effectiveness of newly developed guidelines for obtaining blood cultures. methods: using recent literature and local expert opinion, institutional guidelines for obtaining blood cultures in pediatric patients with  cap were developed. a retrospective chart review of children treated in the emergency department or admitted for cap from january 2010 through june 2011 was  conducted. demographic and clinical data were collected, including results of blood cultures. chi2 tests assessed for variables associated with bacteremia, whether a blood culture was obtained, and if the decision to obtain a culture was appropriate based on our guidelines. results: the study included 330 patients; 155 (47%) blood cultures were obtained in our patient population. five cultures were true-positive findings, making the prevalence of bacteremia 3.2% in patients with blood cultures and 1.5% in all patients. all 5 true positive results met criteria for blood culture based on our guidelines. applying our guidelines retrospectively, the decision to obtain a blood culture met criteria in 55% of the cases. bivariate analysis showed that patients discharged from the emergency  department had higher rates of guideline-appropriate decisions than patients admitted. radiographic findings were associated with making a guideline-appropriate decision regarding blood culture. conclusions: instituting  local guidelines that limit the frequency of obtaining blood cultures in pediatric patients with cap is likely to capture any patient with bacteremia. this study suggests that blood cultures may not need to be routinely obtained in  all patients admitted to the hospital with cap.

TI  == liquid-liquid diffusion crystallization improves the x-ray diffraction of endos,  an endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase from streptococcus pyogenes with activity on human igg.
AB  == endoglycosidase s (endos) is an enzyme secreted by streptococcus pyogenes that specifically hydrolyzes the beta-1,4-di-n-acetylchitobiose core glycan on immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies. one of the most common human pathogens and the cause of group a streptococcal infections, s. pyogenes secretes endos in order to evade the host immune system by rendering igg effector mechanisms dysfunctional.  on account of its specificity for igg, endos has also been used extensively for chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous igg glycoprotein preparations and is being developed as a novel therapeutic for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. the structural basis of its enzymatic activity and substrate specificity, however, remains unknown. here, the purification and crystallization of endos are reported. using traditional hanging-drop and sitting-drop vapor-diffusion crystallization, crystals of endos were grown that diffracted to a maximum of 3.5 a resolution but suffered from severe anisotropy, the data from which could only  be reasonably processed to 7.5 a resolution. when endos was crystallized by liquid-liquid diffusion, it was possible to grow crystals with a different space  group to those obtained by vapor diffusion. crystals of wild-type endoglycosidase and glycosynthase constructs of endos grown by liquid-liquid diffusion diffracted to 2.6 and 1.9 a resolution, respectively, with a greatly diminished anisotropy.  despite extensive efforts, the failure to reproduce these liquid-liquid diffusion-grown crystals by vapor diffusion suggests that these crystallization methods each sample a distinct crystallization space.

TI  == assessment of viable bacteria and bacterial dna in blood and bloodstain specimens stored under various conditions.
AB  == microbial forensic specimens that are collected at biocrime and bioterrorism scenes include blood, tissue, cloths containing biological fluids, swabs, water,  soil, and aerosols. it is preferable that pathogens in such specimens are alive and kept in a steady state. specimens may be stored for a prolonged period before analysis; therefore, it is important to understand the effect of the storage conditions on the pathogens contained within the specimens. in this study, we prepared blood and bloodstain specimens containing gram-negative or -positive bacteria, stored the samples for 482 days under various conditions, and measured  viable bacterial counts and total bacterial contents in the samples. viable bacteria were preserved well in the samples stored at -30 and -80 degrees c, but  were diminished or undetectable in the samples stored at 4 degrees c and room temperature. the total bacterial content was maintained in the blood samples stored at -30 and -80 degrees c and in the bloodstain samples stored under all temperature conditions, but decreased in the blood samples stored at 4 degrees c  and room temperature. this study showed that the storage conditions affected viable bacteria and bacterial dna and that freezing and drying were significant for their long-term storage. we provide important information for the storage of  microbial forensic specimens.

TI  == structural model for covalent adhesion of the streptococcus pyogenes pilus through a thioester bond.
AB  == the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes produces pili that are essential for adhesion to host surface receptors. cpa, the adhesin at the pilus tip, was recently shown to have a thioester-containing domain. the thioester bond is believed to be important in adhesion, implying a mechanism of covalent attachment analogous to that used by human complement factors. here, we have characterized a second active thioester-containing domain on cpa, the n-terminal domain of cpa (cpan). expression of cpan in escherichia coli gave covalently linked dimers. these were shown by x-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry to comprise two cpan molecules cross-linked by the polyamine spermidine following reaction with the thioester bonds. this cross-linked cpan dimer provides a model for the covalent attachment of cpa to target receptors and thus the streptococcal pilus to host cells. similar thioester domains were identified in cell wall proteins of other gram-positive pathogens, suggesting that thioester domains are more widely  used and provide a mechanism of adhesion by covalent bonding to target molecules  on host cells that mimics that used by the human complement system to eliminate pathogens.

TI  == cloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of spycep, a candidate antigen for a vaccine against streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus; gas) is an important human pathogen against which an effective vaccine does not yet exist. the s. pyogenes protein spycep (s. pyogenes cell-envelope proteinase) is a surface-exposed subtilisin-like serine protease of 1647 amino acids. in addition to its auto-protease activity, spycep is capable of cleaving interleukin 8 and related chemokines, contributing to gas immune-evasion strategies. spycep is immunogenic  and confers protection in animal models of gas infections. in order to structurally characterize this promising vaccine candidate, several spycep protein-expression constructs were designed, cloned, produced in escherichia coli, purified by affinity chromatography and subjected to crystallization trials. crystals of a selenomethionyl form of a near-full-length spycep ectodomain were obtained. the crystals diffracted x-rays to 3.3 a resolution and  belonged to space group c2, with unit-cell parameters a=139.2, b=120.4, c=104.3 a, beta=111 degrees .

TI  == new non-alcoholic formulation for hand disinfection.
AB  == hand washing is considered as the single most important strategy to prevent infections. world health organization (who) defines hand hygiene as a primary issue of personal care with particular reference to hospital personnel and health facility workers. in this work, we investigated a new combination for hand disinfection as an alternative to alcohol-based and chlorhexidine products. the new combination of 5-pyrrolidone-2-carboxylic acid (pca) and copper sulphate pentahydrate (cs) was tested upon different bacterial species that normally colonize hands, including staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus  (mr s. aureus), staphylococcus epidermidis, multidrug resistant s. epidermidis (mdr s. epidermidis), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, candida albicans and three clinical isolates: mr s. aureus, mdr s. epidermidis, and an e. coli strain. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics),  minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices, and fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) indices were evaluated. ethanol 70% v/v, isopropanol 60% v/v, and 4% w/v chlorhexidine solution were used as reference hand disinfectants. copper sulphate pentahydrate  was very effective against all tested microorganisms: the mic and mbc for cs ranged from 781 mg/l against s. pyogenes to 12500 mg/l against e. coli strains and c. albicans. in addition, pca exhibited a good antimicrobial activity, in particular, against s. pyogenes and s. agalactiae. the combination of cs and pca  showed a strong synergistic effect and all fic indices were </=0.500. the combination of cs and pca were more effective than ethanol 70% v/v and isopropanol 60% v/v. in addition to antimicrobial activity, the new formulation possesses peculiar features such as residual activity and moisturizing effect. this work identifies a new strategy for hand disinfection.

TI  == retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance and bacterial spectrum of infection in gabon, central africa.
AB  == background: physicians depend on reliable information on the local epidemiology of infection and antibiotic resistance rates to guide empiric treatment in critically ill patients. as these data are scarce for central africa, we performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological findings from a secondary care hospital in gabon. methods: microbiological reports from 2009 to 2012 were used to assess the non-susceptibility rates of the three most common isolates from six major types of infections (bloodstream, ear-eye-nose-throat, surgical site, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract and wound infection). results: a high diversity of pathogens was found, but staphylococcus aureus was predominant in the majority of infections. overall, the three most prevalent pathogens in children were s. aureus (33.7%), streptococcus pyogenes (8.1%) and escherichia coli (4.5%) and in adults s. aureus (23.5%), e. coli (15.1%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%). in total, 5.8% (n = 19) of all s. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)  producing enterobacteriaceae was 15.4% (n = 78), 49.4% of all k. pneumoniae were  esbl-producer (n = 42). conclusion: the high diversity of potential pathogens and high resistance rates in gram-negative bacteria challenge a rational empiric use  of antibiotics. countrywide continuous sentinel surveillance is therefore urgently needed.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis of the variable domain of scl2.3, a streptococcal collagen-like protein from invasive m3-type streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcal collagen-like proteins (scls) are widely expressed by the well recognized human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. these surface proteins contain  a signature central collagen-like region and an amino-terminal globular domain, termed the variable domain, which is protruded away from the cell surface by the  collagen-like domain. despite their recognized importance in bacterial pathogenicity, no structural information is presently available on proteins of the scl class. the variable domain of scl2 from invasive m3-type s. pyogenes has  successfully been crystallized using vapour-diffusion methods. the crystals diffracted to 1.5 a resolution and belonged to space group h32, with unit-cell parameters a = 44.23, b = 44.23, c = 227.83 a. the crystal structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion using anomalous signal from a europium  chloride derivative.|

TI  == impact of bacteria and bacterial components on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
AB  == adult mesenchymal stem cells (msc) are present in several tissues, e.g. bone marrow, heart muscle, brain and subcutaneous adipose tissue. in invasive infections msc get in contact with bacteria and bacterial components. not much is known about how bacterial pathogens interact with msc and how contact to bacteria influences msc viability and differentiation potential. in this study we investigated the impact of three different wound infection relevant bacteria, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes, and the cell wall components lipopolysaccharide (lps; gram-negative bacteria) and lipoteichoic acid (lta; gram-positive bacteria) on viability, proliferation, and osteogenic as well as adipogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (admsc). we show that all three tested species were able to attach to  and internalize into admsc. the heat-inactivated gram-negative e. coli as well as lps were able to induce proliferation and osteogenic differentiation but reduce adipogenic differentiation of admsc. conspicuously, the heat-inactivated gram-positive species showed the same effects on proliferation and adipogenic differentiation, while its cell wall component lta exhibited no significant impact on admsc. therefore, our data demonstrate that osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of admsc is influenced in an oppositional fashion by bacterial antigens and that msc-governed regeneration is not necessarily reduced under infectious conditions.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the canward surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 canadian hospitals from january 2010 to december 2012. in total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method (document m07-a9, 2012), with mics interpreted by using clsi breakpoints (document m100-s23, 2013). ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (mic90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, and haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, c. freundii, and h. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to clsi mic interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (p. mirabilis) to 54.0% (s. marcescens). all isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (mic90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity  against staphylococci or streptococci. all isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 0.03 mug/ml), streptococcus pyogenes (mic90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and streptococcus agalactiae (mic90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. we conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of enterobacteriaceae resistant to  third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)- and ampc-producing e. coli and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.

TI  == improving the lethal effect of cpl-7, a pneumococcal phage lysozyme with broad bactericidal activity, by inverting the net charge of its cell wall-binding module.
AB  == phage endolysins are murein hydrolases that break the bacterial cell wall to provoke lysis and release of phage progeny. recently, these enzymes have also been recognized as powerful and specific antibacterial agents when added exogenously. in the pneumococcal system, most cell wall associated murein hydrolases reported so far depend on choline for activity, and cpl-7 lysozyme constitutes a remarkable exception. here, we report the improvement of the killing activity of the cpl-7 endolysin by inversion of the sign of the charge of the cell wall-binding module (from -14.93 to +3.0 at neutral ph). the engineered  variant, cpl-7s, has 15 amino acid substitutions and an improved lytic activity against streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiresistant strains), streptococcus pyogenes, and other pathogens. moreover, we have demonstrated that  a single 25-mug dose of cpl-7s significantly increased the survival rate of zebrafish embryos infected with s. pneumoniae or s. pyogenes, confirming the killing effect of cpl-7s in vivo. interestingly, cpl-7s, in combination with 0.01% carvacrol (an essential oil), was also found to efficiently kill gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli and pseudomonas putida, an effect not described previously. our findings provide a strategy to improve the lytic activity of phage endolysins based on facilitating their pass through the negatively charged bacterial envelope, and thereby their interaction with the cell wall target, by modulating the net charge of the cell wall-binding modules.

TI  == chemical composition and biological activities of essential oils of eremanthus erythropappus (dc) mcleisch (asteraceae).
AB  == the chemical composition of the essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of different parts of eremanthus erythropappus, including leaves, branches and inflorescences, was investigated by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the antimicrobial activity of the oils was assessed by the disc diffusion and microdilution methods, while the antioxidant activity was evaluated by dpph and reducing power tests. the main compounds found in the essential oils derived from the inflorescences and leaves were beta-caryophyllene, germacrene-d, alpha-copaene and beta-pinene. alpha-bisabolol  was the major component in the branches. the oils were active against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and fungi, but not escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mic values ranged from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/ml. using  the dpph test, the ic50 values ranged from 38.77 +/- 0.76 to 102.24 +/- 1.96 mug/ml, while the reducing power test produced ic50 values between 109.85 +/- 1.68 and 169.53 +/- 0.64 mug/ml. the results revealed that the e. erythropappus oils are new promising potential sources of antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds with good future practical applications for human health.

TI  == active, soluble recombinant melittin purified by extracting insoluble lysate of escherichia coli without denaturation.
AB  == cell lytic peptides are a class of drugs that can be used to selectively kill invading organisms or diseased cells. several of these peptides have been identified as potential therapeutics. herein, we report a novel process for purifying recombinant melittin, a cell lytic peptide that inserts into the membranes of cells causing cell lysis, from escherichia coli. the process involves surfactant and low ph to solubilize melittin fusion proteins from the insoluble fraction of bacterial lysates. we are able to significantly improve purity of the final product and confirm the activity of the peptide. the process  yields recombinant melittin that is effective when used to treat u-87 mg glioma cells and inhibits growth of the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pyogenes. we demonstrate a method of repeated extraction of the insoluble protein fraction with mild detergent at a low ph that is able to generate a yield of pure, soluble melittin of approximately 0.5-1 mg/l of e. coli culture.

TI  == presence of escherichia coli, trueperella pyogenes, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci and prevalence of subclinical endometritis.
AB  == subclinical endometritis (sce) has a severe negative effect on reproductive performance of dairy cows. different studies have shown a wide variety of cut points for the polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocyte (pmnl) percentage to define sce and differing sampling times. possible risk factors for sce, such as low body condition score, hyperketonemia, and increased haptoglobin concentrations have been demonstrated. the aim of this study was to determine the relationship between bacterial findings in the uterus and pmnl in the early postpartum period and to compare 2 classification schemes for the diagnosis of sce. cytological and bacteriological samples from the uterus were taken from 149  cows at 2 consecutive times postpartum [10 +/- 1 and 24 +/- 1 d in milk (dim)] and additionally, 131 cows were sampled at 21 to 27 dim. for sample collection, the cytobrush technique was used and vaginal discharge was examined by vaginoscopy. polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocyte cut points were set at 5, 10, and 18%. cows positive with alpha-hemolytic streptococci at 10 +/- 1 dim had  significant higher pmnl percentages at 21 to 27 dim and greater median days to pregnancy (193.5d) than cows not infected (123.0 d). cows with trueperella pyogenes at 10+/-1 dim had higher odds (5.2) of having more than 18% pmnl at 21 to 27 dim compared with cows without infection. escherichia coli had no effect on the prevalence of sce regardless of the cut point. primiparous cows with more than 18% pmnl had greater median days to pregnancy (144.5 d) than cows with less  than 5% (80.0 d) or cows between 5 and 18% pmnl (68.0 d). cows between 5 and 18%  pmnl or 10 and 18% pmnl showed the best reproductive performance. the results demonstrate that an early infection with alpha-hemolytic streptococci increased the pmnl percentage 2 wk later and that 18% pmnl at 21 to 27 dim was a predictive cut point for primiparous cows to diagnose animals with or without sce.

TI  == the thioredoxin antioxidant system.
AB  == the thioredoxin (trx) system, which is composed of nadph, thioredoxin reductase (trxr), and thioredoxin, is a key antioxidant system in defense against oxidative stress through its disulfide reductase activity regulating protein dithiol/disulfide balance. the trx system provides the electrons to thiol-dependent peroxidases (peroxiredoxins) to remove reactive oxygen and nitrogen species with a fast reaction rate. trx antioxidant functions are also shown by involvement in dna and protein repair by reducing ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductases, and regulating the activity of many redox-sensitive transcription factors. moreover, trx systems play critical roles  in the immune response, virus infection, and cell death via interaction with thioredoxin-interacting protein. in mammalian cells, the cytosolic and mitochondrial trx systems, in which trxrs are high molecular weight selenoenzymes, together with the glutathione-glutaredoxin (grx) system (nadph, glutathione reductase, gsh, and grx) control the cellular redox environment. recently mammalian thioredoxin and glutathione systems have been found to be able to provide the electrons crossly and to serve as a backup system for each other.  in contrast, bacteria trxrs are low molecular weight enzymes with a structure and reaction mechanism distinct from mammalian trxr. many bacterial species possess specific thiol-dependent antioxidant systems, and the significance of the trx system in the defense against oxidative stress is different. particularly, the absence of a gsh-grx system in some pathogenic bacteria such as helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and staphylococcus aureus makes the bacterial trx system essential for survival under oxidative stress. this provides an opportunity to kill these bacteria by targeting the trxr-trx system.

TI  == kinetic characterization of arginine deiminase and carbamate kinase from streptococcus pyogenes m49.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) is an important human pathogen causing mild superficial infections of skin and mucous membranes, but also life-threatening systemic diseases. s. pyogenes and other prokaryotic organisms use the arginine deiminase system (ads) for survival in acidic environments. in this study, the arginine deiminase (ad), and carbamate kinase (ck) from s. pyogenes m49 strain 591 were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, purified, and kinetically characterized. ad and ck from s. pyogenes m49 share high amino acid sequence similarity with the respective enzymes from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 (45.6% and 53.5% identical amino acids) and enterococcus faecalis v583 (66.8% and 66.8% identical amino acids). we found that the arginine deiminase of s. pyogenes is not allosterically regulated by the intermediates and products of the arginine degradation (e.g., atp, citrulline, carbamoyl phosphate). the km and vmax values for arginine were 1.13+/-0.12mm (mean+/-sd) and 1.51+/-0.07mumol/min/mg protein. the carbamate kinase is inhibited by atp but unaffected by arginine and citrulline. the km and  vmax values for adp were 0.72+/-0.08mm and 1.10+/-0.10mumol/min/mg protein and the km for carbamoyl phosphate was 0.65+/-0.07mm. the optimum ph and temperature  for both enzymes were 6.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively.

TI  == endos2 is a unique and conserved enzyme of serotype m49 group a streptococcus that hydrolyses n-linked glycans on igg and alpha1-acid glycoprotein.
AB  == many bacteria have evolved ways to interact with glycosylation functions of the immune system of their hosts. streptococcus pyogenes [gas (group a streptococcus)] secretes the enzyme endos that cleaves glycans on human igg and impairs the effector functions of the antibody. the ndos gene, encoding endos, has, until now, been thought to be conserved throughout the serotypes. however, in the present study, we identify endos2, an endoglycosidase in serotype m49 gas  strains. we characterized endos2 and the corresponding ndos2 gene using sequencing, bioinformatics, phylogenetic analysis, recombinant expression and lc-ms analysis of glycosidic activity. this revealed that endos2 is present exclusively, and highly conserved, in serotype m49 of gas and is only 37% identical with endos. endos2 showed endo-beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase activity on all n-linked glycans of igg and on biantennary and sialylated glycans of agp (alpha1-acid glycoprotein). the enzyme was found to act only on native igg and agp and to be specific for free biantennary glycans with or without terminal sialylation. gas m49 expression of endos2 was monitored in relation to carbohydrates present in the culture medium and was linked to the presence of sucrose. we conclude that endos2 is a unique endoglycosidase in serotype m49 and  differs from endos of other gas strains by targeting both igg and agp. endos2 expands the repertoire of gas effectors that modify key glycosylated molecules of host defence.

AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effect of a first and repeated cases of bacteria-specific clinical mastitis (cm) on the risk of mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows. the pathogens studied were streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., trueperella pyogenes, others, and no growth on aerobic culture. a total of 50,166 lactations were analyzed from 5 large, high-milk-producing dairy herds in new york state from 2003/2004 to 2011. generalized linear mixed models with a poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of parity, month of lactation,  cm, calving diseases, pregnancy status, current season, and economic values on the risk of mortality and culling. among first-lactation cows, the presence of a  first cm case generally exposed cows to a greater risk of mortality in the current month (compared with the absence of a first case). this was especially acute with a first case of klebsiella spp., where cows were 4.5 times more at risk [95% confidence interval (ci): 2.7-7.6] of mortality, and with a first case  of e. coli were 3.3 times more at risk (95% ci: 2.5-4.5). in first-parity cows, the risk of culling generally increased with a case of bacteria-specific cm. this was observed among cows with a first case of t. pyogenes [relative risk=10.4 (95% ci: 8.4-12.8)], a first case of klebsiella spp. [relative risk=6.7 (95% ci: 5.5-8.1)], a first case of staph. aureus [relative risk=4.8 (95% ci: 2.7-8.4)], a first case of e. coli [relative risk=3.1 (95% ci: 2.7-3.6)], and a third case of  klebsiella spp. [relative risk=5.0 (95% ci: 3.1-8.0)]. in general, the presence of a first or second/third case resulted in cows in parity >/=2 with a greater risk of mortality. this was greatest for cows with a first case of klebsiella spp. [relative risk=3.7 (95% ci: 3.3-4.3)], followed by a second/third case of klebsiella spp. [relative risk=3.2 (95% ci: 2.5-4.0)], a first case of e. coli [relative risk=3.0 (95% ci: 2.7-3.3)], and a first case of other cm [relative risk=1.8 (95% ci: 1.6-2.0)]. among cows of parity >/=2, the risk of culling was greater for cows as they progressed through lactations [i.e., cows in parity 4+ were 2.1 (95% ci: 2.0-2.2) times more likely to be culled compared with cows in lactation 2 (the baseline)]. the risk of culling dependent on the cow's characteristics can be easily calculated from the parameter estimates in the provided tables.

TI  == an arm-swapped dimer of the streptococcus pyogenes pilin specific assembly factor sipa.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) is a major human pathogen. attachment of gas to host cells depends in large part on pili. these assemblies are built from multiple covalently linked subunits of a backbone protein (fcta),  which forms the shaft of the pilus, and two minor pilin proteins, fctb anchoring  the pilus to the cell wall and cpa functioning as the adhesin at the tip. polymerisation of the pilin subunits is mediated by a specific sortase, which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds linking successive subunits. an additional gene, sipa, is also essential for gas pilus polymerisation, but its function remains undefined. here we report the crystal structure of a truncated sipa protein from gas, determined at 1.67a resolution. the structure reveals that sipa has the same core fold as the escherichia coli type-i signal peptidase (spase-i), but has a much smaller non-catalytic domain. the truncated protein, which lacks 9 n-terminal residues, forms an arm-swapped dimer in which the c-terminal beta-strand of each monomer crosses over to interact with an n-terminal strand from the other monomer. in addition, there is no peptide binding cleft and significant differences in the putative membrane association region.

TI  == characterization of a trifunctional glucosyltransferase essential for moraxella catarrhalis lipooligosaccharide assembly.
AB  == the human respiratory tract pathogen moraxella catarrhalis expresses lipooligosaccharides (los), glycolipid surface moieties that are associated with  enhanced colonization and virulence. recent studies have delineated the major steps required for the biosynthesis and assembly of the m. catarrhalis los molecule. we previously demonstrated that the glucosyltransferase enzyme lgt3 is  responsible for the addition of at least one glucose (glc) molecule, at the beta-(1-4) position, to the inner core of the los molecule. our data further suggested a potential multifunctional role for lgt3 in los biosynthesis. the studies reported here demonstrate that the lgt3 enzyme possesses two glycosyltransferase domains (a1 and a2) similar to that of other bifunctional glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in surface polysaccharide biosynthesis in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus pyogenes. each lgt3 domain contains a conserved dxd motif, shown to be involved in the catalytic activity of other glycosyltransferases. to determine the function of each domain, a1 (n-terminal), a2 (c-terminal) and double a1a2 site-directed dad to aaa mutants were constructed and the resulting los phenotypes of these modified strains were  analyzed. our studies indicate that the lgt3 n-terminal a1 catalytic domain is responsible for the addition of the first beta-(1-3) glc to the first glc on the  inner core. the c-terminal catalytic domain a2 then adds the beta-(1-4) glc and the beta-(1-6) glc, confirming the bifunctional nature of this domain. the results from these experiments demonstrate that lgt3 is a novel, multifunctional  transferase responsible for the addition of three glcs with differing linkages onto the inner core of m. catarrhalis los.

AB  == recent advances in high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) have enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes. however, computational methods for analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have  not kept pace with the large and growing data sets generated by rna-seq technology. here, we present new algorithms, specific to bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of rna-seq data. the algorithms are implemented in an open source software system called rockhopper that supports various stages of bacterial rna-seq data analysis, including aligning sequencing  reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing results. we demonstrate the performance of rockhopper  using 2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 rna-seq experiments conducted with escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, salmonella enterica, streptococcus pyogenes and xenorhabdus nematophila. we find that the transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from e. coli and n. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system's ability to identify novel small rnas, operons and transcription start sites. our  results suggest that rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial rna-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.

AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of ll-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == some agents, including escherichia coli and group a streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. ll-37 is a human host defence peptide shown  previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. however, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of ll-37 remains obscure. in order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on ll-37's activity against e. coli and s. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly  used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (porphyromonas gingivalis and  fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates  as indicated by the growth curves generated. the sensitivities of e. coli and s.  pyogenes to ll-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. the oxygen facultative e. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to ll-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. the microaerophilic pathogen s. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to ll-37 under oxygen deprivation. our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly lucilia cuprina.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly lucilia sericata (meigen) (diptera:calliphoridae) against bacteria. however, the antibacterial activity of  its sibling species, lucilia cuprina (wiedemann) (diptera:calliphoridae) against  a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. the aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of l. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli). the turbidimetric assay demonstrated that l. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (p < 0.001). additionally, colony-forming unit (cfu), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against p. aeruginosa. the reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. these observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == identification of beta-haemolysin-encoding genes in streptococcus anginosus.
AB  == streptococcus anginosus is an emerging pathogen, but little is known about its virulence factors. to detect the genes responsible for beta-haemolysis we performed genomic mutagenesis of the beta-haemolytic s. anginosus type strain atcc 12395 using the vector pghost9:iss1. integration site analysis of 15 non-haemolytic mutants identified a gene cluster with high homology to the genes  of the streptolysin s (sls) encoding sag gene cluster of s. pyogenes. the gene cluster harbours 10 open reading frames displaying significant similarities to the s. pyogenes genes saga-sagi, with the identities on protein level ranging from 38 to 87%. complementation assays of s. anginosus sagb and sagd integration  mutants with the respective genes confirmed their importance for beta-haemolysin  production and suggest the presence of post-translational modifications in s. anginosus sls similar to sls of s. pyogenes. characterization of the s. anginosus haemolysin in comparison to the s. pyogenes sls showed that the haemolysin is surface bound, but in contrast to s. pyogenes neither fetal calf serum nor rna was able to stabilize the haemolysin of s. anginosus in culture supernatants. inhibition of beta-haemolysis by polyethylene glycol of different sizes was carried out, giving no evidence of a pore-forming haemolytic mechanism. analysis  of a whole genome shotgun sequence of streptococcus constellatus, a closely related streptococcal species that belongs to the s. anginosus group, revealed a  similar sag gene cluster. employing a genomic mutagenesis strategy we were able to determine an sls encoding gene cluster in s. anginosus and demonstrate its importance for beta-haemolysin production in s. anginosus.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == milk haptoglobin, milk amyloid a, and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity in bovines with naturally occurring clinical mastitis diagnosed with a quantitative  pcr test.
AB  == the associations between quantitative bacteriological results from a real-time pcr test and concentrations of acute-phase proteins (app) and n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) activity in milk in naturally occurring  clinical mastitis were investigated. milk app concentrations and nagase activity  in clinical mastitis caused by different udder pathogens were studied. the associations between the severity of the clinical signs and concentrations of app and nagase activity were estimated. milk samples from 281 cases of clinical mastitis were collected from 3 estonian dairy farms and analyzed by pcr to identify pathogens. twenty-seven samples out of 281 (9.6%) were pcr negative. milk samples containing 4 or more bacterial species (n=28) were considered possibly contaminated and excluded from all further analyses. in total, 443 bacterial identifications were made from the remaining 226 milk samples. a single bacterial species was detected in 68 samples (30.1%), 2 species were detected in  99 samples (43.8%), and 3 species were detected in 59 (26.1%) samples. to determine the inflammatory response in the udder, the concentrations of milk amyloid a (maa) and haptoglobin (hp) and nagase activity in the milk were analyzed. a significant positive association was found between the severity of the clinical signs and inflammatory markers in the milk. milk amyloid a and hp concentrations and nagase activity were significantly higher in samples with large quantities of bacterial dna from escherichia coli or streptococcus dysgalactiae compared with milk samples not containing those species. large quantities of bacterial dna from trueperella pyogenes or streptococcus uberis in  the milk were associated with elevated concentrations of hp and high nagase activity, but not with increased maa concentrations. milk samples containing corynebacterium bovis and coagulase-negative staphylococci had significantly lower concentrations of maa and hp and lower nagase activity compared with samples where these species were not detected. it can be concluded that concentrations of app and nagase activity in the milk were associated with the quantity of bacterial dna in the milk samples.

TI  == crrna and tracrrna guide cas9-mediated dna interference in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the cas9-crrna complex of the streptococcus thermophilus dgcc7710 crispr3-cas system functions as an rna-guided endonuclease with crrna-directed target sequence recognition and protein-mediated dna cleavage. we show here that an additional rna molecule, tracrrna (trans-activating crispr rna), co-purifies with the cas9 protein isolated from the heterologous e. coli strain carrying the s. thermophilus dgcc7710 crispr3-cas system. we provide experimental evidence that tracrrna is required for cas9-mediated dna interference both in vitro and in vivo. we show that cas9 specifically promotes duplex formation between the precursor crrna (pre-crrna) transcript and tracrrna, in vitro. furthermore, the housekeeping rnase iii contributes to primary pre-crrna-tracrrna duplex cleavage  for mature crrna biogenesis. rnase iii, however, is not required in the processing of a short pre-crrna transcribed from a minimal crispr array containing a single spacer. finally, we show that an in vitro-assembled ternary cas9-crrna-tracrrna complex cleaves dna. this study further specifies the molecular basis for crrna-based re-programming of cas9 to specifically cleave any target dna sequence for precise genome surgery. the processes for crrna maturation and effector complex assembly established here will contribute to the  further development of the cas9 re-programmable system for genome editing applications.

TI  == repurposing crispr as an rna-guided platform for sequence-specific control of gene expression.
AB  == targeted gene regulation on a genome-wide scale is a powerful strategy for interrogating, perturbing, and engineering cellular systems. here, we develop a method for controlling gene expression based on cas9, an rna-guided dna endonuclease from a type ii crispr system. we show that a catalytically dead cas9 lacking endonuclease activity, when coexpressed with a guide rna, generates a dna recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, rna polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding. this system, which we call crispr interference (crispri), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes in escherichia coli, with no detectable off-target effects. crispri can be used to repress multiple target genes simultaneously, and its effects are reversible. we also show evidence that the system can be adapted for  gene repression in mammalian cells. this rna-guided dna recognition platform provides a simple approach for selectively perturbing gene expression on a genome-wide scale.

TI  == multifunctional conducting fibres with electrically controlled release of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == we hereby present a new method of producing coaxial conducting polymer fibres loaded with an antibiotic drug that can then be subsequently released (or sustained) in response to electrical stimulation. the method involves wet-spinning of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (pedot:pss) fibre, which served as the inner core to the electropolymerised outer shell layer of polypyrrole (ppy). ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (cipro) was selected as the model drug and as the dopant in the ppy synthesis. the release of cipro in phosphate buffered saline (pbs) from the fibres was controlled by switching the redox state of ppy.cipro layer. released cipro under passive and stimulated conditions were tested against gram positive (streptococcus pyogenes)  and gram negative (escherichia coli) bacteria. significant inhibition of bacterial growth was observed against both strains tested. these results confirm  that cipro retains antibacterial properties during fibre fabrication and electrochemically controlled release. in vitro cytotoxicity testing utilising the neural b35 cell line confirmed the cytocompatibility of the drug loaded conducting fibres. electrical conductivity, cytocompatibility and tuning release  profile from this flexible fibre can lead to promising bionic applications such as neuroprosthetics and localised drug delivery.

TI  == glycolytic oscillations in a model of a lactic acid bacterium metabolism.
AB  == glycolytic oscillations in yeast have been extensively studied. it is still unclear, if these oscillations are caused by the allosteric enzyme phosphofructokinase or the stoichiometry of glycolysis which contains an autocatalysis with respect to atp. bacterial glycolysis shows a different stoichiometry, however, also containing a stoichiometric autocatalysis. for escherichia coli, the regulation of the enzyme phosphofructokinase is also assumed to be a major reason for oscillations to occur. we investigated glycolytic oscillations in a quantitative kinetic model for streptococcus pyogenes set-up on the basis of experimental data. we found oscillations within physiologically feasible parameter ranges. we investigated the origin of these oscillations and conclude that, again, both the stoichiometry of the system, as well as its allosterically regulated enzymes can give rise to these oscillations. for the analysis we employed established and new optimization methods for finding oscillatory regimes and present these in the context of this study.

TI  == split spy0128 as a potent scaffold for protein cross-linking and immobilization.
AB  == site-specific cross-linking techniques between proteins and additional functional groups have become increasingly important for expanding the utility of proteins in biochemistry and biotechnology. in order to explore powerful techniques for practical bioconjugation applications, we have validated a technique mediated by  a unique property of streptcoccus pyogenes pilin subunit spy0128, an autocatalytic intramolecular isopeptide formation in spy0128. recently, it has been revealed that spy0128 can be split into two fragments (split-spy0128 (residues 18-299 of spy0128) and isopeptag (residues 293-308 of spy0128)) that were capable of forming an intermolecular covalent complex. we focused on this unique reconstitution property and first studied the bioconjugation of blue and green fluorescent proteins, enabling the direct monitoring of cross-linking reactions by forster resonance energy transfer (fret). a fluorescence lifetime study shows that spatial control of two proteins on the spy0128 scaffold is possible when one protein is fused to the n-terminus of split-spy0128 and another one is tethered at the n- or c-terminus of the isopeptag. furthermore, we demonstrated site-specific protein immobilization mediated by the reconstitution  of split-spy0128 and isopeptag. in this case, a split-spy0128 mutant with a free  n-terminal cys residue was first immobilized onto beads chemically modified with  a maleimide group through a michael addition process. then, an isopeptagged protein was successfully immobilized onto the split-spy0128-immobilized beads. these results suggest that spy0128 is a potent proteinaceous scaffold available for bioconjugation both in solution and at a solid surface.

AB  == isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase is an essential enzyme in those living organisms such as pathogenic strains of streptococcus and staphylococcus genera which rely on the mevalonate pathway for the production of isoprenoids. the pathogens contain type 2 idi in contrast to human that contains type 1 idi. therefore, the type 2 idi may be a potential target for the therapy of some infectious diseases. in the current study, a virtual screening by docking was performed among 2000 chemicals from cococo library to find a specific inhibitor for type 2 idis. to this end, the structures of the type 2 idis of bacillus licheniformis, pseudomonas stutzeri, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were molded using comparative modeling and hidden markov model (hmm) based prediction. the predicted models were evaluated based on q-mean and prosa score.  molegro virtual docker with moldock scoring function was used for measuring the binding affinity of the found inhibitor to the active site of the models. also the inhibition effect of the compound was virtually tested on the crystallography-solved structures of the sulfolobus shibatae and thermus thermophilus type 2 idis as well as the escherichia coli type 1 idi. finally, the inhibition effect of the found inhibitor was virtually tested on the human type 1 idi. interestingly, the results suggest that the inhibitor efficiently binds to and inhibits the bacterial idis especially the type 2 idis of pathogens while it  is not inhibiting the human idi.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == towards scalable production of a collagen-like protein from streptococcus pyogenes for biomedical applications.
AB  == background: collagen has proved valuable as biomedical materials for a range of clinical applications, particularly in wound healing. it is normally produced from animal sources, such as from bovines, but concerns have emerged over transmission of diseases. recombinant collagens would be preferable, but are difficult to produce. recently, studies have shown that 'collagens' from bacteria, including streptococcus pyogenes, can be produced in the laboratory as  recombinant products, and that these are biocompatible. in the present study we have established that examples of bacterial collagens can be produced in a bioreactor with high yields providing proof of manufacture of this important group of proteins. results: production trials in shake flask cultures gave low yields of recombinant product, < 1 g/l. increased yields, of around 1 g/l, were obtained when the shake flask process was transferred to a stirred tank bioreactor, and the yield was further enhanced to around 10 g/l by implementation of a high cell density fed-batch process and the use of suitably formulated fully defined media. similar yields were obtained with 2 different constructs, one containing an introduced heparin binding domain. the best yields, of up to 19 g/l were obtained using this high cell density strategy, with an extended 24 h production time. conclusions: these data have shown that recombinant bacterial collagen from s. pyogenes, can be produced in sufficient yield by a scalable microbial production process to give commercially acceptable yields for broad use in biomedical applications.

TI  == the influence of specific binding of collagen-silk chimeras to silk biomaterials  on hmsc behavior.
AB  == collagen-like proteins in the bacteria streptococcus pyogenes adopt a triple-helix structure with a thermal stability similar to that of animal collagens, can be expressed in high yield in escherichia coli and can be easily modified through molecular biology techniques. however, potential applications for such recombinant collagens are limited by their lack of higher order structure to achieve the physical properties needed for most biomaterials. to overcome this problem, the s. pyogenes collagen domain was fused to a repetitive  bombyx mori silk consensus sequence, as a strategy to direct specific non-covalent binding onto solid silk materials whose superior stability, mechanical and material properties have been previously established. this approach resulted in the successful binding of these new collagen-silk chimeric proteins to silk films and porous scaffolds, and the binding affinity could be controlled by varying the number of repeats in the silk sequence. to explore the  potential of collagen-silk chimera for regulating biological activity, integrin (int) and fibronectin (fn) binding sequences from mammalian collagens were introduced into the bacterial collagen domain. the attachment of bioactive collagen-silk chimeras to solid silk biomaterials promoted hmsc spreading and proliferation substantially in comparison to the controls. the ability to combine the biomaterial features of silk with the biological activities of collagen allowed more rapid cell interactions with silk-based biomaterials, improved regulation of stem cell growth and differentiation, as well as the formation of artificial extracellular matrices useful for tissue engineering applications.

TI  == microbial diversity of bovine mastitic milk as described by pyrosequencing of metagenomic 16s rdna.
AB  == dairy cow mastitis is an important disease in the dairy industry. different microbial species have been identified as causative agents in mastitis, and are traditionally diagnosed by bacterial culture. the objective of this study was to  use metagenomic pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s rrna genes to investigate bacterial dna diversity in milk samples of mastitic and healthy dairy cows and compare the results with those obtained by classical bacterial culture. one hundred and thirty-six milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of mastitis and used for microbiological culture. additionally, 20 milk samples were collected from healthy quarters. bacterial dna was isolated from the same milk samples and the 16s rrna genes were individually amplified and pyrosequenced. discriminant analysis showed that the groups of samples that were most clearly different from the rest and thus easily discriminated were the normal milk samples from healthy cows and those characterised by culture as trueperella pyogenes and streptococcus spp. the mastitis pathogens identified by culture were generally among the most frequent organisms detected by pyrosequencing, and in some cases (escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and streptococcus uberis mastitis)  the single most prevalent microorganism. trueperella pyogenes sequences were the  second most prevalent sequences in mastitis cases diagnosed as trueperella pyogenes by culture, streptococcus dysgalactiae sequences were the second most prevalent sequences in mastitis cases diagnosed as streptococcus dysgalactiae by  culture, and staphyloccocus aureus sequences were the third most prevalent in mastitis cases diagnosed as staphylococcus aureus by culture. in samples that were aerobic culture negative, pyrosequencing identified dna of bacteria that are known to cause mastitis, dna of bacteria that are known pathogens but have so far not been associated with mastitis, and dna of bacteria that are currently not known to be pathogens. a possible role of anaerobic pathogens in bovine mastitis  is also suggested.

TI  == the evolution of catalytic residues and enzyme mechanism within the bacterial nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily 1.
AB  == nucleoside phosphorylases are essential for the salvage and catabolism of nucleotides in bacteria and other organisms, and members of this enzyme superfamily have been of interest for the development of antimicrobial and cancer therapies. the nucleotide phosphorylase superfamily 1 encompasses a number of different enzymes which share a general superfold and catalytic mechanism, while  they differ in the nature of the nucleophiles used and in the nature of characteristic active site residues. recently, one subfamily, the uridine phosphorylases, has been subdivided into two types which differ with respect to the mechanism of transition state stabilization, as dictated by differences in critical amino acid residues. little is known about the phylogenetic distribution and relationship of the two different types, as well as the relationship to other np-1 superfamily members. here comparative genomic analysis illustrates that up-1s and up-2s fall into monophyletic groups and are biased with respect to species representation. up-1 evolved in gram negative bacteria, while gram positive species tend to predominantly contain up-2. pnp (a sister clade to all ups) contains both gram positive and gram negative species. the findings imply that the nucleoside phosphorylase superfamily 1 evolved through a series of three important duplications, leading to the separate, monophyletic enzyme families, coupled to individual lateral transfer events. extensive horizontal transfer explains the occurrence of unexpected uridine phosphorylases in some genomes. this study provides a basis for understanding the evolution of uridine and purine nucleoside phosphorylases with respect to dna/rna metabolism and with potential utility in the design of antimicrobial and anti-tumor drugs.

TI  == bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  == background: zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (zcl) is a polymorphic disease. it is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process.  however, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. material/methods: the aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected zcl and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate zcl from non-zcl lesions in a rural area north of isfahan, iran from july to december 2009. bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. results: the results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for zcl, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of zcl. the bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of zcl (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-zcl lesions. the most common species were staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and s. epidermidis (28%) followed by bacillus sp. streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus sp., enterobacter sp. and pseudomonas aeroginosa. ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, cefazolin and clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. conclusions: bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in zcl, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-zcl lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (acl). local  lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the  treatment of zcl.

TI  == developing vaccines in the era of genomics: a decade of reverse vaccinology.
AB  == vaccines have a significant impact on public health, and vaccinology in the era of genomics is taking advantage of new technologies to tackle diseases for which  vaccine development has so far been unsuccessful. almost all existing vaccines were developed based on traditional vaccinology methods, which relied on empirical screening of a few candidates at a time, based on known features of the pathogen. however, the ability to sequence a pathogen's genome provides access to its entire antigenic repertoire. as such, genomics has catalysed a shift in vaccine development towards sequence-based 'reverse vaccinology' approaches, which use high-throughput in silico screening of the entire genome of a pathogen  to identify genes that encode proteins with the attributes of good vaccine targets. furthermore, the increasing availability of genome sequences has led to  the development and application of additional technologies to vaccine discovery,  including comparative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, immunomics and structural genomics. vaccine candidates identified from a pathogen's genome or proteome can then be expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in appropriate  in vitro or in vivo models to assess immunogenicity and protection. the process of reverse vaccinology has been applied to several pathogens, including serogroup b neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and pathogenic escherichia coli, and has provided scores of new candidate antigens for preclinical and clinical investigation. as novel genome-based technologies continue to emerge, it is expected that new vaccines for unmet diseases will be within reach.

TI  == purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the adhesion domain of epf from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the extracellular protein epf from streptococcus pyogenes is important for streptococcal adhesion to human epithelial cells. however, epf has no sequence identity to any protein of known structure or function. thus, several predicted domains of the 205 kda protein epf were cloned separately and expressed in escherichia coli. the n-terminal domain of epf was crystallized in space groups p2(1) and p2(1)2(1)2(1) in the presence of the protease chymotrypsin. mass spectrometry showed that the species crystallized corresponded to a fragment comprising residues 52-357 of epf. complete data sets were collected to 2.0 and 1.6 a resolution, respectively, at the australian synchrotron.

TI  == standardizing an in vitro procedure for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of wound dressings and the assessment of three wound dressings.
AB  == objectives: a wide selection of wound dressings is available on the market with varying claims of antimicrobial efficacy. a valid standard method for evaluation  of their antimicrobial activity in vitro has not been established. in this study  we suggest a standardized time-kill assay procedure for antimicrobial activity evaluation of wound dressings in order to make studies more comparable and reproducible. we also tested two silver-containing dressings and one propolis-containing dressing against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa using our proposed procedure. methods: the following dressings were tested: the ionic silver-containing dressing (iscd), nanocrystalline silver coated dressing (nscd)  and a propolis-containing dressing (pcd) that is in development. a time-kill assay and the zone of inhibition test were used in the study. results: nscd exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity against all organisms. isdc also demonstrated good antibacterial activity although inferior to nscd. pcd did not show any bactericidal effect. conclusions: based on our findings we suggest that  a time-kill assay with a 1 cm(2) dressing is used for evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of wound dressings, and that the dressings should be exposed to a standardized inoculum of 1-1.5 x 10(6) cfu/ml with mueller-hinton broth as the most appropriate medium. pcd requires further research to establish  its clinical value.

TI  == heterologous co-expression of acca, fabd, and thioesterase genes for improving long-chain fatty acid production in pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli.
AB  == the goal of the present study was to increase the content of intracellular long-chain fatty acids in two bacterial strains, pseudomonas aeruginosa pa14 and  escherichia coli k-12 mg1655, by co-overexpressing essential enzymes that are involved in the fatty acid synthesis metabolic pathway. recently, microbial fatty acids and their derivatives have been receiving increasing attention as an alternative source of fuel. by introducing two genes (acca and fabd) of p. aeruginosa into the two bacterial strains and by co-expressing with them the fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase gene of streptococcus pyogenes (strain mgas10270), we have engineered recombinant strains that are efficient producers of long-chain fatty acids (c16 and c18). the recombinant strains exhibit a 1.3-1.7-fold increase in the production of long-chain fatty acids over  the wild-type strains. to enhance the production of total long-chain fatty acids, we researched the carbon sources for optimized culture conditions and results were used for post-culture incubation period. e. coli sgjs17 (containing the acca, fabd, and thioesterase genes) produced the highest content of intracellular total fatty acids; in particular, the unsaturated fatty acid content was about 20-fold higher than that in the wild-type e. coli.

TI  == an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  == preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose  (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p =  0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer  than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13  days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.

AB  == the aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) generation. we examined toll-like receptor (tlr)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (lta) staphylococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (lam) mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (pgn) staphylococcus aureus, as well as tlr4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (lps) klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, pophyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli. we also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-, interleukin (il)-6-, ccl5-, and il-10-priming on mast cell cyslt synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. we found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cyslt generation; however, the extent of cyslt release in response to stimulation varied. out of the examined antigens lps p. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cyslt generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/ml). other lpss affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. ltas were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/ml, while lam and pgn stimulated mast cells to maximal cyslt generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/ml. anti-tlr2 and anti-tlr4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) inhibitor significantly diminished cyslt generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. priming with tnf,  il-6 and ccl5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cyslt generation, while il-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cyslt synthesis by mast cells.  these observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cyslts strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.

TI  == visible light-responsive core-shell structured in(2)o(3)@cain(2)o(4) photocatalyst with superior bactericidal properties and biocompatibility.
AB  == antibacterial activity of photocatalytic substrates is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. visible light-responsive photocatalysts were recently discovered, offering greater opportunity to use photocatalysts as disinfectants in our living environment. the development of antibacterial photocatalysts, however, has mainly focused on titanium oxide (tio(2))-related materials with antibacterial properties not comparable with conventional chemical disinfectants. this study demonstrated that a core-shell structured in(2)o(3)@cain(2)o(4) substrate has superior visible light-induced bactericidal properties, as compared with several commercially available and laboratory-prepared visible light-responsive photocatalysts. the high performance is enhanced by more easily photoexcited electron transfer between the interfaces  of in(2)o(3) and cain(2)o(4) to minimize the electron-hole recombination during photocatalysis. additionally, when compared with tio(2)-based photocatalysts, in(2)o(3)@cain(2)o(4) treatments did not induce significant cell death and tissue damage, implying a superior biocompatibility. these findings suggest that in(2)o(3)@cain(2)o(4) may have potential application in the development of a safer and highly bactericidal photocatalyst. from the clinical editor: a photocatalytic susbstrate is described that functions in visible light, possesses bactericidal properties and better biocompatibility than the standard tio(2) based methods.

TI  == rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16s rdna sequences.
AB  == accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (hrma) of 16s rdna sequences. real-time pcr amplification of 16s rrna gene fragment, spanning the variable region v5 and v6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. first, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. six of the isolates, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus  uberis, staphylococcus aureus and mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, arcanobacterium pyogenes, corynebacterium bovis and streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. four of the type strains, e. coli, s. agalactiae, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of a. pyogenes, e. coli, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, k. pneumoniae, s. uberis and s. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the hrma. next, the hrma was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. the three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. overall accuracy of the validation assay was  95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity  observed in the pcr amplicons of s. uberis. the present study revealed that broad-range real-time pcr with hrma can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost  tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.

TI  == the effect of recurrent episodes of clinical mastitis caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and other organisms on mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of recurrent episodes of  different types of clinical mastitis (cm) caused by gram-positive (streptococcus  spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp.) and gram-negative (escherichia  coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, enterobacter, pseudomonas) bacteria, and other organisms (arcanobacterium pyogenes, mycoplasma, corynebacterium bovis, yeast, miscellaneous) on the probability of mortality and culling in holstein dairy cows. data from 30,233 lactations in cows of 7 dairy farms in new york state were analyzed. cows were followed for the first 10 mo in lactation, or until death or  culling occurred, or until the end of our study period. generalized linear mixed  models with a poisson error distribution were used to study the effects of recurrent cases of the different types of cm and several other factors (herd, parity, month of lactation, current year and season, profitability, net replacement cost, other diseases) on cows' probability of death (model 1) or being culled (model 2). primiparous and multiparous cows were modeled separately  because they had different risks of mortality and culling and potentially different cm effects on mortality and culling. approximately 30% of multiparous cows had at least one case of cm in lactation compared with 16.6% of primiparous  cows. multipara also had higher lactational incidence risks of second (10.7%) and third (4.4%) cases than primipara (3.7% and 1.1%, respectively). for primipara, cm increased the probability of death, with each successive case occurring in a month being increasingly lethal. in multipara, gram-negative cm increased the probability of death, especially when the gram-negative case was the first or second cm case in lactation. primiparous cows with cm were more likely to be culled after cm than if they did not have cm, particularly after a second or third case. in multipara, any type of cm increased the probability of being culled. gram-negative cm cases were associated with the numerically highest risk  of culling.

TI  == robustness assessment of whole bacterial genome segmentations.
AB  == comparison of closely related bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of highly conserved sequences forming a "backbone" that is interrupted by numerous,  less conserved, dna fragments. segmentation of bacterial genomes into backbone and variable regions is particularly useful to investigate, among other things, bacterial genome evolution. several software tools have been designed to compare  complete bacterial chromosomes and a few online databases store pre-computed genome comparisons. however, very few statistical methods are available to evaluate the reliability of these software tools and to compare the results obtained with them. to fill this gap, we have developed two local scores to measure the robustness of bacterial genome segmentations. our method uses a simulation procedure based on random perturbations of the compared genomes. the two scores described in this article provide useful information and are easy to implement, and their interpretation is intuitive. we show that they are suited to discriminate between robust and non-robust segmentations when genome aligners such as mauve and mga are used.

AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) indices of antibiotics predicted by a semimechanistic pkpd model: a step toward model-based dose optimization.
AB  == a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (pkpd) model that characterizes the full time course of in vitro time-kill curve experiments of antibacterial drugs was here evaluated in its capacity to predict the previously determined pk/pd indices. six drugs (benzylpenicillin, cefuroxime, erythromycin, gentamicin, moxifloxacin, and  vancomycin), representing a broad selection of mechanisms of action and pk and pd characteristics, were investigated. for each drug, a dose fractionation study was simulated, using a wide range of total daily doses given as intermittent doses (dosing intervals of 4, 8, 12, or 24 h) or as a constant drug exposure. the time  course of the drug concentration (pk model) as well as the bacterial response to  drug exposure (in vitro pkpd model) was predicted. nonlinear least-squares regression analyses determined the pk/pd index (the maximal unbound drug concentration [fc(max)]/mic, the area under the unbound drug concentration-time curve [fauc]/mic, or the percentage of a 24-h time period that the unbound drug concentration exceeds the mic [ft(>mic)]) that was most predictive of the effect. the in silico predictions based on the in vitro pkpd model identified the previously determined pk/pd indices, with ft(>mic) being the best predictor of the effect for beta-lactams and fauc/mic being the best predictor for the four remaining evaluated drugs. the selection and magnitude of the pk/pd index were, however, shown to be sensitive to differences in pk in subpopulations, uncertainty in mics, and investigated dosing intervals. in comparison with the use of the pk/pd indices, a model-based approach, where the full time course of effect can be predicted, has a lower sensitivity to study design and allows for pk differences in subpopulations to be considered directly. this study supports the use of pkpd models built from in vitro time-kill curves in the development of optimal dosing regimens for antibacterial drugs.

TI  == delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase as a new target for therapeutics: inhibition of the enzyme from streptococcus pyogenes and effects in vivo.
AB  == compounds able to interfere with amino acid biosynthesis have the potential to inhibit cell growth. in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, unless an ornithine cyclodeaminase is present, the activity of delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (p5c) reductase is mandatory to proline production, and the enzyme inhibition should result in amino acid starvation, blocking in turn protein synthesis. the ability of some substituted derivatives of aminomethylenebisphosphonic acid and its analogues to interfere with the activity of the enzyme from the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes was investigated. several compounds were able to suppress activity in the micromolar  range of concentrations, with a mechanism of uncompetitive type with respect to the substrate p5c and non-competitive with respect to the electron donor nad(p)h. the actual occurrence of enzyme inhibition in vivo was supported by the effects of the most active derivatives upon bacterial growth and free amino acid content.

TI  == antimicrobial effects of plasma-mediated bipolar radiofrequency ablation on bacteria and fungi relevant for wound infection.
AB  == infection constitutes an important part of wound pathology and impedes wound healing. plasma-mediated bipolar radiofrequency ablation (coblation((r))) is a tissue-removal technique suggested for use in wound treatment. the aims of this study were to determine the antimicrobial effect of ablation exposure on bacteria and fungi relevant to wound infection, and how exposure time, temperature and aerobic/anaerobic growth influence the effect. suspensions of 10(6) colony-forming units/ml of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and candida albicans were exposed to ablation or thermal control for 500, 1000 or 2000 ms, or left untreated, and incubated aerobically. e. coli was also incubated anaerobically. ablation was significantly (p < 0.0001) microbicidal on all strains compared with untreated and thermal control. the reductions compared with untreated control were 99.87-99.99% for all strains. in conclusion, plasma-mediated bipolar radio-frequency ablation has a general microbicidal effect in vitro on microbes relevant to wound infection independent of aerobic/anaerobic growth and thermal effect.

TI  == the crystal structure of streptococcus pyogenes uridine phosphorylase reveals a distinct subfamily of nucleoside phosphorylases.
AB  == uridine phosphorylase (up), a key enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway, catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine or 2'-deoxyuridine to uracil and ribose 1-phosphate or 2'-deoxyribose 1-phosphate. this enzyme belongs to the  nucleoside phosphorylase i superfamily whose members show diverse specificity for nucleoside substrates. phylogenetic analysis shows streptococcus pyogenes uridine phosphorylase (spup) is found in a distinct branch of the pyrimidine subfamily of nucleoside phosphorylases. to further characterize spup, we determined the crystal structure in complex with the products, ribose 1-phosphate and uracil, at 1.8 a resolution. like escherichia coli up (ecup), the biological unit of spup is a hexamer with an alpha/beta monomeric fold. a novel feature of the active site is the presence of his169, which structurally aligns with arg168 of the ecup structure. a second active site residue, lys162, is not present in previously determined up structures and interacts with o2 of uracil. biochemical studies of  wild-type spup showed that its substrate specificity is similar to that of ecup,  while ecup is approximately 7-fold more efficient than spup. biochemical studies  of spup mutants showed that mutations of his169 reduced activity, while mutation  of lys162 abolished all activity, suggesting that the negative charge in the transition state resides mostly on uracil o2. this is in contrast to ecup for which transition state stabilization occurs mostly at o4.

TI  == a microbial platform for rapid and low-cost virus-like particle and capsomere vaccines.
AB  == studies on a platform technology able to deliver low-cost viral capsomeres and virus-like particles are described. the technology involves expression of the vp1 structural protein from murine polyomavirus (mupyv) in escherichia coli, followed by purification using scaleable units and optional cell-free vlp assembly. two insertion sites on the surface of mupyv vp1 are exploited for the presentation of the m2e antigen from influenza and the j8 peptide from group a streptococcus (gas). results from testing on mice following subcutaneous administration demonstrate that vlps are self adjuvating, that adding adjuvant to vlps provides  no significant benefit in terms of antibody titre, and that adjuvanted capsomeres induce an antibody titre comparable to vlps but superior to unadjuvanted capsomere formulations. antibodies raised against gas j8 peptide following immunization with chimeric j8-vp1 vlps are bactericidal against a gas reference strain. e. coli is easily and widely cultivated, and well understood, and delivers unparalleled volumetric productivity in industrial bioreactors. indeed,  recent results demonstrate that mupyv vp1 can be produced in bioreactors at multi-gram-per-litre levels. the platform technology described here therefore has the potential to deliver safe and efficacious vaccine, quickly and cost effectively, at distributed manufacturing sites including those in less developed countries. additionally, the unique advantages of vlps including their stability  on freeze drying, and the potential for intradermal and intranasal administration, suggest this technology may be suited to numerous diseases where  adequate response requires large-scale and low-cost vaccine manufacture, in a way that is rapidly adaptable to temporal or geographical variation in pathogen molecular composition.

AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  == antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == to study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. the microbiological quality of  honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. the bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. all honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more  resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in  the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.

TI  == bacteriology and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of peritonsillar abscess.
AB  == introduction: peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute tonsillitis. its management consists of aspiration or surgical drainage followed  by appropriate antibiotics. appropriate antibiotic treatment depends on the common organisms associated with infection and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern in local scenario. methods: pus samples aspirated from diagnosed cases of peritonsillar abscess and submitted for culture and sensitivity in last two years were included in this study. identification of different microorganisms was made  on the basis of the microscopic findings, observation of their colony morphology  and standard biochemical reactions. susceptibility pattern to commonly used antibiotics were determined by clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: altogether 24 pus samples were included in the study. positive culture was obtained from 18 samples. among them one organism was isolated from 13 samples whereas from five samples multiple organisms were isolated. from six samples no organisms could be cultured. altogether streptococcus pyogenes was isolated from 12 samples and staphylococcus aureus from five samples. other isolated organisms included haemophlilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus species. penicillin was effective for streptococcus pyogenes whereas staphylococcus aureus was resistant  to it. cloxacillin was found to be effective for staphylococcus aureus. ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were found to be effective for both organisms. conclusions: streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus were more commonly  associated with peritonsillar abscess. streptococcus pyogenes were sensitive to penicillin but all staphylococcus aureus were resistant to it. this fact should be considered in clinical practice for management of peritonsillar abscess.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of stem bark extracts from phyllanthus muellerianus (kuntze) excell.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: the plants of the genus phyllanthus (euphorbiaceae) are widely distributed in most tropical and subtropical countries, and have long been used in folk medicine to treat several diseases. particularly, phyllanthus muellerianus (kuntze) excell, commonly called "mbolongo" in cameroon, is used by pygmies baka as a remedy for tetanus and wound infections. aim of the study: to investigate the antimicrobial properties of phyllanthus muellerianus (kuntze) excell (family euphorbiaceae) stem bark used in cameroon by baka pygmies as a remedy for wound healing and tetanus. materials and methods: aqueous and methanol extracts with and without defatting treatment, were prepared and their activity against clostridium sporogenes atcc 3584, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus pyogenes atcc 19615, escherichia coli atcc 10536, candida albicans atcc 10231, was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the  minimum bactericidal-fungicidal concentration (mbc-mfc) by the macrodilution method. results: water extract showed a weak activity against clostridium sporogenes (mic 900 mug/ml) and resulted inactive at the tested concentrations against all the other microorganisms. the defatted methanol extract, inactive against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, candida albicans, exhibited a very interesting activity against clostridium sporogenes and streptococcus pyogenes (mic 100 mug/ml and 300 mug/ml, respectively), which seems to validate the use of this plant in pygmies traditional medicine for the treatment of tetanus and wound infections. the activity found against streptococcus mutans (300 mug/ml), aetiological agent of caries, may suggest a possible use of this plant as natural remedy to prevent dental diseases. conclusions: the activity against streptococci and clostridium sporogenes atcc 3584, showed by stem bark extracts of phyllanthus muellerianus, traditionally used by baka pygmies to treat wound infections and tetanus, is reported for the first time.

TI  == crispr rna maturation by trans-encoded small rna and host factor rnase iii.
AB  == crispr/cas systems constitute a widespread class of immunity systems that protect bacteria and archaea against phages and plasmids, and commonly use repeat/spacer-derived short crrnas to silence foreign nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner. although the maturation of crrnas represents a key event in crispr activation, the responsible endoribonucleases (case, cas6, csy4)  are missing in many crispr/cas subtypes. here, differential rna sequencing of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes uncovered tracrrna, a trans-encoded small rna with 24-nucleotide complementarity to the repeat regions of crrna precursor transcripts. we show that tracrrna directs the maturation of crrnas by the activities of the widely conserved endogenous rnase iii and the crispr-associated csn1 protein; all these components are essential to protect s. pyogenes against prophage-derived dna. our study reveals a novel pathway of small guide rna maturation and the first example of a host factor (rnase iii) required for bacterial rna-mediated immunity against invaders.

TI  == dissecting a bacterial collagen domain from streptococcus pyogenes: sequence and  length-dependent variations in triple helix stability and folding.
AB  == to better investigate the relationship between sequence, stability, and folding,  the streptococcus pyogenes collagenous domain cl (gly-xaa-yaa)(79) was divided to create three recombinant triple helix subdomains a, b, and c of almost equal size with distinctive amino acid features: an a domain high in polar residues, a b domain containing the highest concentration of pro residues, and a very highly charged c domain. each segment was expressed as a monomer, a linear dimer, and a  linear trimer fused with the trimerization domain (v domain) in escherichia coli. all recombinant proteins studied formed stable triple helical structures, but the stability varied depending on the amino acid sequence in the a, b, and c segments and increased as the triple helix got longer. v-aaa was found to melt at a much lower temperature (31.0 degrees c) than v-abc (v-cl), whereas v-bbb melted at almost the same temperature ( approximately 36-37 degrees c). when heat-denatured, the v domain enhanced refolding for all of the constructs; however, the folding rate was affected by their amino acid sequences and became reduced for longer constructs. the folding rates of all the other constructs were lower than that of the natural v-abc protein. amino acid substitution mutations at all pro residues in the c fragment dramatically decreased stability but increased the folding rate. these results indicate that the thermostability of the bacterial collagen is dominated by the most stable domain in the same manner  as found with eukaryotic collagens.

TI  == strategy for microbiome analysis using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis on the illumina sequencing platform.
AB  == understanding the identity and changes of organisms in the urogenital and other microbiomes of the human body may be key to discovering causes and new treatments of many ailments, such as vaginosis. high-throughput sequencing technologies have recently enabled discovery of the great diversity of the human microbiome. the cost per base of many of these sequencing platforms remains high (thousands of dollars per sample); however, the illumina genome analyzer (iga) is estimated to  have a cost per base less than one-fifth of its nearest competitor. the main disadvantage of the iga for sequencing pcr-amplified 16s rrna genes is that the maximum read-length of the iga is only 100 bases; whereas, at least 300 bases are needed to obtain phylogenetically informative data down to the genus and species  level. in this paper we describe and conduct a pilot test of a multiplex sequencing strategy suitable for achieving total reads of > 300 bases per extracted dna molecule on the iga. results show that all proposed primers produce products of the expected size and that correct sequences can be obtained, with all proposed forward primers. various bioinformatic optimization of the illumina  bustard analysis pipeline proved necessary to extract the correct sequence from iga image data, and these modifications of the data files indicate that further optimization of the analysis pipeline may improve the quality rankings of the data and enable more sequence to be correctly analyzed. the successful application of this method could result in an unprecedentedly deep description (800,000 taxonomic identifications per sample) of the urogenital and other microbiomes in a large number of samples at a reasonable cost per sample.

TI  == comparative genome-wide analysis of small rnas of major gram-positive pathogens:  from identification to application.
AB  == in the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. the detection of small rnas (srnas) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. several experimental technologies to predict srna have been established for the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli. in many respects, srna screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of srnas for gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of srnas in colonization and pathogenicity for listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. here, we report  the current knowledge about the srnas of these socioeconomically relevant gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput srna screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide srna identification and target prediction. finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (pnas) as a novel tool to inactivate potential srna and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == novel bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligase inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity and antibacterial efficacy in vivo.
AB  == dna ligases are indispensable enzymes playing a critical role in dna replication, recombination, and repair in all living organisms. bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligase (liga) was evaluated for its potential as a broad-spectrum antibacterial target. a novel class of substituted adenosine analogs was discovered by target-based high-throughput screening (hts), and these compounds were optimized  to render them more effective and selective inhibitors of liga. the adenosine analogs inhibited the liga activities of escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, with inhibitory activities in the nanomolar range. they were selective for bacterial nad+-dependent dna ligases, showing no inhibitory activity against  atp-dependent human dna ligase 1 or bacteriophage t4 ligase. enzyme kinetic measurements demonstrated that the compounds bind competitively with nad+. x-ray  crystallography demonstrated that the adenosine analogs bind in the amp-binding pocket of the liga adenylation domain. antibacterial activity was observed against pathogenic gram-positive and atypical bacteria, such as s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and m. pneumoniae, as well as against gram-negative pathogens, such as h. influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. the mode of action was verified using recombinant strains with altered liga expression, an okazaki fragment accumulation assay, and the isolation of resistant strains with liga mutations. in vivo efficacy was demonstrated in a murine s. aureus thigh infection model and a murine s. pneumoniae lung infection  model. treatment with the adenosine analogs reduced the bacterial burden (expressed in cfu) in the corresponding infected organ tissue as much as 1,000-fold, thus validating liga as a target for antibacterial therapy.

TI  == streptococcal collagen-like surface protein 1 promotes adhesion to the respiratory epithelial cell.
AB  == background: collagen-like surface proteins scl1 and scl2 on streptococcus pyogenes contain contiguous gly-x-x triplet amino acid motifs, the characteristic structure of human collagen. although the potential role of scl1 in adhesion has  been studied, the conclusions may be affected by the use of different s. pyogenes strains and their carriages of various adhesins. to explore the bona fide nature  of scl1 in adherence to human epithelial cells without the potential interference of other streptococcal surface factors, we constructed a scl1 isogenic mutant from the scl2-defective s. pyogenes strain and a scl1-expressed escherichia coli. results: loss of scl1 in a scl2-defective s. pyogenes strain dramatically decreased the adhesion of bacteria to hep-2 human epithelial cells. expression of scl1 on the surface of the heterologous bacteria e. coli significantly increased  adhesion to hep-2. the increase in adhesion was nullified when scl1-expressed e.  coli was pre-incubated with proteases or antibodies against recombinant scl1 (rscl1) protein. treatment of hep-2 cells with rscl protein or pronase drastically reduced the binding capability of scl1-expressed e. coli. these findings suggest that the adhesion is mediated through scl1 on bacterial surface  and protein receptor(s) on epithelial cells. further blocking of potential integrins revealed significant contributions of alpha2 and beta1 integrins in scl1-mediated binding to epithelial cells. conclusions: together, these results underscore the importance of scl1 in the virulence of s. pyogenes and implicate scl1 as an adhesin during pathogenesis of streptococcal infection.

TI  == diagnosis of intramammary infection in samples yielding negative results or minor pathogens in conventional bacterial culturing.
AB  == up to half of quarter milk samples submitted for mastitis diagnosis are culture-negative results or lead to identification of coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacterium bovis in conventional culturing, the so-called minor pathogens. the interpretation and usefulness of these results in terms of udder and animal health management is limited, even though the amount of resources spent is relatively high. this work aimed to test two methods of analysis of milk samples with the goal of increasing detection of intramammary pathogens. in the first study, 783 milk samples were processed in duplicate: before and after freezing at -20 degrees c for 24 h, using standard bacteriological techniques. there was a significant difference between the two methods with samples frozen for 24 h yielding significantly fewer gram-positive catalase-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and significantly more samples leading to no growth, than samples before freezing. the number of samples yielding gram-positive catalase-negative cocci was not significantly affected by freezing. in the second study, a real-time pcr-based test was performed on milk samples with an individual quarter somatic cell count  above 500,000 cells/ml that were either negative (n=51 samples) or that led to the isolation of minor pathogens in culturing: corynebacterium bovis (n=79 samples) or non-aureus staphylococci (nas, n=32). a mastitis pathogen, beyond the result obtained with standard bacteriology, was detected on 47% of the no-growth  samples, on 35% of the samples from which c. bovis had been isolated and on 25% of the samples from which nas had been isolated. the most commonly detected major pathogen was escherichia coli, followed by streptococcus uberis, arcanobacterium  pyogenes/peptoniphilus indolicus and streptococcus dysgalactiae. these results suggest that simply freezing milk samples for 24 h does not increase the detection of intramammary bacteria in milk samples and therefore should not be recommended. however, use of the real-time pcr-based test may be useful in diagnosing intramammary infections when milk samples with high somatic cell counts are culture-negative or when culturing results in the detection of minor pathogens.

AB  == background: a prototype solid-state ultraviolet-c (uvc) led device may be useful  in the treatment of corneal microbial infections, as uvc is commonly used for eradicating bacteria, fungi and viruses in other settings. this study assessed the efficacy of 265 nm uvc from this led, on four different bacterial strains, and investigated the consequences of corresponding exposures on human corneal epithelial cells in vitro. methods: agar plate lawns of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes were exposed  to a 4.5 mm diameter 265 nm uvc beam at a fixed intensity and distance, for 30, 5, 4, 2 and 1 seconds. growth inhibition was assessed with a biorad gel imager, and the diameter of lucent areas of bacterial inhibition recorded. human corneal  epithelial cells cultured on glass cover-slips were exposed to corresponding doses of uvc from the same device. live/dead staining was performed and the results quantified. results: there was 100% inhibition of growth for all bacteria tested, at all exposure times. a 30-second exposure of human corneal epithelium to uvc gave no statistically significant decrease (p = 0.877) in the ratio of live to dead cells when compared to control cultures. conclusion: the results confirmed that a 1 second exposure to germicidal uvc from this led source was sufficient to inhibit microbial proliferation in the four bacterial strains tested in vitro. the literature suggests uvc at this dose could potentially be beneficial in treating corneal surface infections, without causing significant adverse effects, supported by our findings in human corneal epithelium exposed to uvc.

TI  == investigation of oral opportunistic pathogens in independent living elderly japanese.
AB  == objective: pneumonia is reported to be associated with high morbidity in elderly  and compromised individuals, with poor oral health demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. several opportunistic pathogens, such as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, have been detected in patients with pneumonia. we investigated the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity of healthy independent living japanese elderly subjects and analysed factors related to harbouring those pathogens. materials and methods: we studied 265 subjects, each of whom received a dental examination, during which specimens were collected with a tongue swab and examined for the presence of 10 oral opportunistic pathogens using single or multiple selective media. furthermore, the presence of  occult blood in saliva was examined using test paper strips. results: oral opportunistic pathogens were detected in 13.6% of the subjects. those positive for occult blood in saliva had a significantly higher rate of harbouring the pathogens (p < 0.05). in addition, age was a significant factor for the presence  of pathogenic microbes in the oral cavity (p = 0.033). conclusion: positive findings of occult blood in saliva and older age are suggested to be significant  factors for harbouring opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from respiratory tract of pigs in  poland between 2004 and 2008.
AB  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from nasal swabs and lungs of pigs, to 16 commonly used antibiotics, was determined by disc diffusion test. beta-lactams showed the best activity against streptococcus suis (s. suis) (> 99% of susceptible strains). the lowest sensitivity of s. suis was evidenced to: tylosin, tetracycline and neomycin (50%, 40% and 25%, respectively). isolates of  escherichia coli (e. coli) demonstrated the highest susceptibility to cephalosporin (85% strains), gentamicin and norfloxacin (over 74%). the lowest susceptibility of e. coli was demonstrated to tiamulin and penicillin (11.3% and  1.9%, respectively). over 80% of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (app) strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. the highest resistance of app, but demonstrated by below 20% of tested isolates only, was evidenced to neomycin and  lxs. isolates of pasteurella multocida (pm), haemophilus parasuis (hps) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (a. pyogenes) were highly susceptible to the most antibiotics included in the analysis. the comparison of the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to the chemotherapeutics used on polish farms for the therapy of bacterial infection of pigs within the last five years and the last 10 years, showed an increasing percent of e. coli and s. suis strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics. it is also shown that pm, hps, app and a. pyogenes isolates were continuously susceptible to the most chemotherapeutics applied.

TI  == screening of extracts of algae from baja california sur, mexico as reversers of the antibiotic resistance of some pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: sixty ethanol extracts of marine flora of baja california sur (mexico) were screened to evaluate the reversing effect of the bacterial resistance to antibiotics in combination with a sublethal concentration of ampicillin or erythromycin. materials and methods: the activity was assayed by using a modification of the classical agar-diffusion method against 3 resistant,  pathogenic bacteria; escherichia coil (atcc baa196), staphylococcus aureus (atcc  baa42), and streptococcus pyogenes (atcc baa946). results: from the 60 ethanolic  extracts, 12 (20%) of them in combination with ampicillin were able to reverse the resistance of staphylococcus aureus and 8 (13%) with erythromycin yielded the same reversal with streptococcus pyogenes. an extract from sargassum horridum was the only one that reversed the resistance to antibiotics against both staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. conclusions: our findings suggest that some algae may be source of compounds with the potential to reverse  the antibiotic resistance of some bacteria. in addition, of the assayed extracts, 35 (57%) showed inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus, 48 (78%) were  active against streptococcus pyogenes, but none was active against escherichia coil. the most active extracts were from laurencia spp., gelidium robustum, chnoospora implexa, padina mexicana, gracilaria subsecundata, and dictyopteris undulata.

TI  == identification and characterization of anti-microbial peptides from rabbit vaginal fluid.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) serve as a first line of host defense and represent an important, though poorly understood components of the innate immune system. the present study was an attempt to identify and characterize the major molecules having anti-bacterial activities from the vaginal fluid of rabbit, oryctologus cuniculus. amps from the rabbit vaginal fluid (rvf) were identified in the acid extracts of pooled rvf samples after rp-hplc purification. the protein, rvfamp was effective against gram negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram positive (staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) bacteria. the results of acid urea-page-gel overlay assay (au-page-goa) demonstrated clear  zone of growth inhibition of e. coli corresponding to 6 and 15 kda protein bands. lc-ms data of these proteins indicated that 15 kda protein consists of lysozyme,  lipopolysaccharide binding protein (lbp), hemoglobin-alpha and beta subunits (hb-alpha/beta), whereas 9 kda protein band consists of transthyretin and calcyclin while uteroglobulin and neutrophil antibacterial peptide-5 (namp-5) are present in the 6 kda protein band. of the eight proteins, hb-alpha derived protein was further characterized, as it showed the highest probability based mowse score (pbms) of 288. a 25mer peptide, rvfhbalphap was active against several clinical pathogens as demonstrated by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and radial diffusion assays (rda). the interaction of rvfhbalphap with bacterial liposome membrane was assessed by calcein dye leakage assay. rvfhbalphap did not show cytotoxicity against human endocervical cells (end1/e6e7) or erythrocytes. rt-pcr and immunofluorescence results revealed the expression of rvfhbalphap mrna and protein in rabbit vaginal tissue. to the best  our knowledge, this is the first report describing the detection of amps in rvfs. in conclusion, these studies indicated that vaginal epithelial cells (vec) derived rvfhbalphap may have therapeutic potential in the management of reproductive well being of rabbits. the major reason for undertaking this study in rabbits is that, it forms an excellent in vivo model system for human's studies.

TI  == structural determinants of inhibitor selectivity in prokaryotic imp dehydrogenases.
AB  == the protozoan parasite cryptosporidium parvum is a major cause of gastrointestinal disease; no effective drug therapy exists to treat this infection. curiously, c. parvum impdh (cpimpdh) is most closely related to prokaryotic impdhs, suggesting that the parasite obtained its impdh gene via horizontal transfer. we previously identified inhibitors of cpimpdh that do not inhibit human impdhs. here, we show that these compounds also inhibit impdhs from helicobacter pylori, borrelia burgdorferi, and streptococcus pyogenes, but not from escherichia coli. residues ala165 and tyr358 comprise a structural motif that defines susceptible enzymes. importantly, a second-generation cpimpdh inhibitor has bacteriocidal activity on h. pylori but not e. coli. we propose that cpimpdh-targeted inhibitors can be developed into a new class of antibiotics that will spare some commensal bacteria.

TI  == peroxide stress elicits adaptive changes in bacterial metal ion homeostasis.
AB  == exposure to hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) and other reactive oxygen species is a universal feature of life in an aerobic environment. bacteria express enzymes to  detoxify h(2)o(2) and to repair the resulting damage, and their synthesis is typically regulated by redox-sensing transcription factors. the best characterized bacterial peroxide-sensors are escherichia coli oxyr and bacillus subtilis perr. analysis of their regulons has revealed that, in addition to inducible detoxification enzymes, adaptation to h(2)o(2) is mediated by modifications of metal ion homeostasis. analogous adaptations appear to be present in other bacteria as here reviewed for deinococcus radiodurans, neisseria gonorrhoeae, streptococcus pyogenes, and bradyrhizobium japonicum. as a general theme, peroxide stress elicits changes in cytosolic metal distribution with the net effect of reducing the damage caused by reactive ferrous iron. iron levels are reduced by repression of uptake, sequestration in storage proteins, and incorporation into metalloenzymes. in addition, peroxide-inducible transporters elevate cytosolic levels of mn(ii) and/or zn(ii) that can displace ferrous iron from sensitive targets. although bacteria differ significantly in the detailed mechanisms employed to modulate cytosolic metal levels, a high mn:fe ratio has emerged as one key correlate of reactive oxygen species resistance.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == moonlighting glutamate formiminotransferases can functionally replace 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cycloligase.
AB  == 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-cho-thf) is formed by a side reaction of serine hydroxymethyltransferase. unlike other folates, it is not a one-carbon donor but  a potent inhibitor of folate enzymes and must therefore be metabolized. only 5-cho-thf cycloligase (5-fcl) is generally considered to do this. however, comparative genomic analysis indicated (i) that certain prokaryotes lack 5-fcl, implying that they have an alternative 5-cho-thf-metabolizing enzyme, and (ii) that the histidine breakdown enzyme glutamate formiminotransferase (ft) might moonlight in this role. a functional complementation assay for 5-cho-thf metabolism was developed in escherichia coli, based on deleting the gene encoding 5-fcl (ygfa). the deletion mutant accumulated 5-cho-thf and, with glycine as sole nitrogen source, showed a growth defect; both phenotypes were complemented by bacterial or archaeal genes encoding ft. furthermore, utilization of supplied 5-cho-thf by streptococcus pyogenes was shown to require expression of the native ft. recombinant bacterial and archaeal fts catalyzed formyl transfer from 5-cho-thf to glutamate, with k(cat) values of 0.1-1.2 min(-1) and k(m) values for 5-cho-thf and glutamate of 0.4-5 mum and 0.03-1 mm, respectively. although the formyltransferase activities of these proteins were far lower than their formiminotransferase activities, the k(m) values for both substrates relative to  their intracellular levels in prokaryotes are consistent with significant in vivo flux through the formyltransferase reaction. collectively, these data indicate that fts functionally replace 5-fcl in certain prokaryotes.

TI  == effective photoinactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  using an hiv-1 tat peptide-porphyrin conjugate.
AB  == given that cell-penetrating peptides (cpp) are cationic and often amphipathic, similar to membrane-active antimicrobial peptides, it may be possible to use cpp  conjugation to improve the delivery of photosensitisers for antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (antimicrobial pdt). we investigated the possibility of using a tat peptide to deliver the photosensitiser, tetrakis(phenyl)porphyrin (tpp) and kill bacteria. the tat peptide is a positively-charged mammalian cell-penetrating peptide with potent antimicrobial activity but no haemolytic activity. fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the bioconjugate can bind to and/or be incorporated into all bacterial species tested. all species were susceptible to the tat-porphyrin, with the bactericidal effect being dependent on both the concentration and the light dose. using the highest light dose, treatment with the tat-porphyrin achieved reductions of 6.6 log(10) and 6.37 log(10) in the viable counts of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and reductions of 5.74 log(10) and 6.6 log(10) in the viable counts of pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. moreover, the tat moiety appears to  confer antimicrobial properties to the conjugate, particularly for the gram positive strains, based on the observation of dark toxicity using 1 mum of tat-porphyrin. finally, the conjugate induced membrane destabilization by synergistic action of the peptide and pdt, resulting in carboxyfluorescein leakage from bacterial membrane-mimicking liposomes. these findings demonstrate that the use of cpp to deliver a photosensitiser is an effective way of improving the uptake and the treatment efficacy of antimicrobial pdt.

AB  == background: non-coding rnas gain more attention as their diverse roles in many cellular processes are discovered. at the same time, the need for efficient computational prediction of ncrnas increases with the pace of sequencing technology. existing tools are based on various approaches and techniques, but none of them provides a reliable ncrna detector yet. consequently, a natural approach is to combine existing tools. due to a lack of standard input and output formats combination and comparison of existing tools is difficult. also, for genomic scans they often need to be incorporated in detection workflows using custom scripts, which decreases transparency and reproducibility. results: we developed a java-based framework to integrate existing tools and methods for ncrna detection. this framework enables users to construct transparent detection  workflows and to combine and compare different methods efficiently. we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining detection methods in case studies with the small genomes of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and streptococcus pyogenes. with the combined method, we gained 10% to 20% precision for sensitivities from 30% to 80%. further, we investigated streptococcus pyogenes for novel ncrnas. using multiple methods--integrated by our framework--we determined four highly probable candidates. we verified all four candidates experimentally using rt-pcr. conclusions: we have created an extensible framework for practical, transparent and reproducible combination and comparison of ncrna detection methods. we have proven the effectiveness of this approach in tests and by guiding experiments to find new ncrnas. the software is freely available under the gnu general public license (gpl), version 3 at http://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/moses along with source code, screen shots, examples and tutorial material.

TI  == intrinsic nitric oxide-stimulatory activity of lipoteichoic acids from different  gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid (lta) is a structural component of the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. similar to lipopolysaccharide (lps) which is expressed in gram-negative bacteria, lta exhibits immunostimulatory properties. frequently observed positive response of lta in the limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay has been interpreted as a sign of lps contamination, raising doubts about the intrinsic immune activities of lta. regarding many similarities in immunobiological and physicochemical properties of lta and lps, we hypothesized that similar to lps, the lal reactivity of lta might be due to its ability to bind to lal. our data confirm the positivity of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes ltas in the lal test. the estimates of suspected lps content were 605, 10.3, 6.2 and 127 pg/mug lta, respectively. the effectiveness of ltas to induce the no production in rat peritoneal cells was remarkably higher than that of equivalent concentrations of  reference lps (escherichia coli). the lps-induced no was inhibited by polymyxin b (pmx), the ic(50) of pmx:lps concentration ratio (pg:pg) being 1050:1. many fold  higher concentrations of pmx were needed to partially suppress the no-augmenting  effects of ltas, applied at concentrations representing the equivalents of lps. transposed to the concentrations of ltas per se, the ic(50)s of the pmx:lta ratios (mug:mug) ranged from 0.3:1 (s. aureus) to 7.5:1 (b. subtilis). it is concluded that lta is not necessarily contaminated with lps. the results prove the intrinsic immunostimulatory properties of ltas of gram-positive bacteria. the positive response of lta in the lal assay results from its capacity to bind to lal. in addition, lta binds with high affinity to pmx.

TI  == bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  == non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. the purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. overall, gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than gram-positive bacteria. for the gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cenocepacia and escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. the susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the sa  78 and atcc 6538 strains, respectively. staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. a rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with p. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive staphylococcus aureus  strain sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. a 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. a 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated p. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. a statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated  animals after the third day of the course. wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.

TI  == a highly unusual thioester bond in a pilus adhesin is required for efficient host cell interaction.
AB  == many bacterial pathogens present adhesins at the tips of long macromolecular filaments known as pili that are often important virulence determinants. very little is known about how pili presented by gram-positive pathogens mediate host  cell binding. the crystal structure of a pilus adhesin from the important human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes reveals an internal thioester bond formed between the side chains of a cysteine and a glutamine residue. the presence of the thioester was verified using uv-visible spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. this  unusual bond has only previously been observed in thioester domains of complement and complement-like proteins where it is used to form covalent attachment to target molecules. the structure also reveals two intramolecular isopeptide bonds, one of these formed through a lys/asp residue pair, which are strategically positioned to confer protein stability. removal of the internal thioester by allele-replacement mutagenesis in s. pyogenes severely compromises bacterial adhesion to model host cells. although current paradigms of bacterial/host cell interaction envisage strong non-covalent interactions, the present study suggests cell adhesion could also involve covalent bonds.

AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi (1). the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their  structural differences: alpha-defensins, beta-defensins, and theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal epithelial cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated  from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins (human beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3) and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4))  have been identified. similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity toward the gram-negative bacteria (e.g., pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and yeasts. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues such as leukocytes, heart, and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelial cells and in neutrophils. a variety of radiolabeled compounds, including 67ga-citrate, 99mtc-ciprofloxacin, 18f-fdg, and 111in- or 99mtc-labeled antibodies that interact with specific receptors on the infiltrating leukocytes, and peptides have been evaluated for the detection of infections (2, 3). however, because they accumulate in both infected and inflamed areas of the body, these radiopharmaceuticals are nonspecific and cannot distinguish between infection and inflammation. in an effort to identify and develop radioactive compounds that are specific for the detection of infections, various investigators have evaluated the use of antimicrobial peptides that are found naturally in most multicellular  organisms (4). such peptides bind specifically to microbes, presumably through cationic domains that interact with anionic regions of the microbial membrane, and have been shown to distinguish infected tissue from inflamed tissue (5). liberatore et al.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes ser/thr kinase-regulated cell wall hydrolase is a cell division plane-recognizing and chain-forming virulence factor.
AB  == cell division and cell wall synthesis are closely linked complex phenomena and play a crucial role in the maintenance and regulation of bacterial virulence. eukaryotic-type ser/thr kinases reported in prokaryotes, including that in group  a streptococcus (gas) (streptococcus pyogenes ser/thr kinase (sp-stk)), regulate  cell division, growth, and virulence. the mechanism of this regulation is, however, unknown. in this study, we demonstrated that sp-stk-controlled cell division is mediated under the positive regulation of secretory protein that possesses a cysteine and histidine-dependent aminohydrolases/peptidases (chap) domain with functionally active cell wall hydrolase activity (henceforth named as cdha (chap-domain-containing and chain-forming cell wall hydrolase). deletion of  the cdha-encoding gene resulted in severe cell division and growth defects in gas mutants. the mutant expressing the truncated cdha (devoid of the chap domain), although displayed no such defects, it became attenuated for virulence in mice and highly susceptible to cell wall-acting antibiotics, as observed for the mutant lacking cdha. when cdha was overexpressed in the wild-type gas as well as  in heterologous strains, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, we observed  a distinct increase in bacterial chain length. our data reveal that cdha is a multifunctional protein with a major function of the n-terminal region as a cell  division plane-recognizing domain and that of the c-terminal chap domain as a virulence-regulating domain. cdha is thus an important therapeutic target.

AB  == the aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. the patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (cap), as defined by british thoracic society, from  december 1998 to dec 2000, at the sher- i-kashmir institute of medical sciences soura, srinagar, india. gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). in 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by staphylococcus aureus (7/29), escherichia coli (6/29), klebsiella spp. (3/29), streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and acinetobacter  spp. (1/29). sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation  (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). the commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), copd (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, pseudomonas in two, klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. the factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of copd or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. the overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. this emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of cap.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy: focus on cefditoren.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy to commonly used antibiotics including cefditoren. six clinical microbiological laboratories collected, between january and september 2009, a total of 2,510 respiratory pathogens from subjects with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (carti). ceftditoren, out of all the beta-lactams studied, had the lowest mic(90 )against  965 strains of streptococcus pneumoniae examined, followed by cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2% resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp)). against 470 haemophilus influenzae , independently of their production of beta-lactamases or ampicillin resistance, cefditoren was the oral cephalosporin with the best in  vitro activity, comparable to that of the injectable cephalosporins and levofloxacin. higher mic(90)s were found for the macrolides (4 - 16 mg/l) and cefaclor (4 - 32 mg/l). as was foreseeable, streptococcus pyogenes (225 strains)  was uniformly sensitive to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, but the elevated mic(90 )values reduced (<75%) susceptibility of this pathogen to macrolides. beta-lactamase-negative moraxella catarrhalis (100 strains) had reduced susceptibility only to the macrolides, while the 250 beta-lactamase-producing strains also had reduced susceptibility to cefuroxime. levofloxacin showed the lowest mic(50)/mic(90 )values in the producing strains, whereas cefditoren, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the non-producers. as regards the enterobacteriaceae, cefditoren and levofloxacin had the lowest mic(90)s against klebsiella pneumoniae. cefditoren and the third-generation injectable cephalosporins had the lowest mic(90)s against escherichia coli (100% susceptibility) while levofloxacin was less active (86% susceptibility).in conclusion, cefditoren's wide spectrum and high intrinsic activity, as well as its capacity to overcome most of the resistance that has become consolidated in some classes of antibiotics widely used as empiric therapy for carti, allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included in the european guidelines as one of the first-choice antibiotics in the treatment of carti.

TI  == a novel approach to the antimicrobial activity of maggot debridement therapy.
AB  == objectives: commercially produced sterile green bottle fly lucilia sericata maggots are successfully employed by practitioners worldwide to clean a multitude of chronic necrotic wounds and reduce wound bacterial burdens during maggot debridement therapy (mdt). secretions from the maggots exhibit antimicrobial activity along with other activities beneficial for wound healing. with the rise  of multidrug-resistant bacteria, new approaches to identifying the active compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity within this treatment are imperative. therefore, the aim of this study was to use a novel approach to investigate the output of secreted proteins from the maggots under conditions mimicking clinical treatments. methods: cdna libraries constructed from microdissected salivary glands and whole maggots, respectively, were treated with transposon-assisted signal trapping (tast), a technique selecting for the identification of secreted proteins. several putative secreted components of insect immunity were identified, including a defensin named lucifensin, which was produced recombinantly as a trx-fusion protein in escherichia coli, purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and reverse-phase hplc, and tested in vitro against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. results: lucifensin was active against staphylococcus carnosus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic 2 mg/l), as well as staphylococcus aureus (mic 16 mg/l). the peptide did not show antimicrobial activity towards gram-negative bacteria. the mic of lucifensin for the methicillin-resistant s. aureus and glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus isolates tested ranged from 8 to >128 mg/l. conclusions: the tast results did not reveal any highly secreted compounds with putative antimicrobial activity, implying an alternative antimicrobial activity of mdt. lucifensin showed antimicrobial activities comparable to other defensins and could have potential as a future drug candidate scaffold, for redesign for other applications besides the topical treatment of infected wounds.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of topical skin pharmaceuticals - an in vitro study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of currently  available topical skin pharmaceuticals against candida albicans, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pyogenes. the agar dilution assay was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration for cream formulations and their active substances. corticosteroid  formulations with the antiseptics clioquinol or halquinol were active against all microbes. the hydrogen peroxide formulation was primarily active against staphylococci. clotrimazole, miconazole and econazole showed an effect against staphylococci in addition to their effect on c. albicans. in contrast, terbinafine had no antibacterial effect. fusidic acid was active against staphylococci, with slightly weaker activity against s. pyogenes and no activity  against c. albicans or e. coli. in summary, some topical skin pharmaceuticals have broad antimicrobial activity in vitro, clioquinol and halquinol being the most diverse. in limited superficial skin infection topical treatment can be an alternative to systemic antibiotics and should be considered. with the global threat of multi-resistant bacteria there is a need for new, topical, non-resistance-promoting, antimicrobial preparations for the treatment of skin infections.

TI  == [immunization and bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx as risk factors for alopecia areata].
AB  == introduction: alopecia areata is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the hair follicles. researchers are currently interested in whether the presence of bacterial pathogens and/or a history of immunization can trigger an autoimmune response in patients who are genetically predisposed. objectives: this study aimed to determine whether there is an association between the development of alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or a history of immunization. material and methods: sixty-five men and women with alopecia areata and 65 control patients with other skin diseases were studied at the dr ladislao  de la pascua dermatology clinic between september 2008 and february 2009. the patients ranged in age from 18-59 years. patients with scalp diseases were excluded from the control group. in all cases, the patient was questioned about immunizations received in the previous 6 months, and a throat swab was cultured.  results: a history of immunization (odds ratio [or], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.6-6.7; p=.001), the presence of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx (or, 2.6; 95% ci, 1.1-6.2; p=.033), and being a carrier of streptococcus pyogenes (or, 2.1; 95% ci, 1.7-2.5; p=.042) were risk factors for alopecia areata. klebsiella pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli were isolated from cultures. conclusions: this is the first study to show an association between alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or history of immunization, as  risk factors for development of the disease. given the characteristics of our study population, the association appears valid for patients with less than 25% hair loss and a course of disease under 1 year.

TI  == antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of walsura robusta roxb.
AB  == walsura robusta roxb. (family: meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. in the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-d-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside a (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of w. robusta. biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and  antigiardial activities was performed. we investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (dpph), hydroxyl radical (oh), and superoxide anion (o(2)) scavenging assays. three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. they scavenged dpph(*) with ic(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microm. we also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with ic(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microm, respectively. other biological activities including  antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and s. pyogenes. aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit gram-positive and some gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and shigella sonnei. however, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of w. robusta on all tested bacterial strains  showed only weak activity, and their mbcs were greater than 25 mg ml(-1). for antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites ml(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg ml(-1) demonstrated no activity (mic > 1000 microg ml(-1)).

TI  == use of natural antimicrobials to increase antibiotic susceptibility of drug resistant bacteria.
AB  == plant-derived antibacterial compounds may be of value as a novel means for controlling antibiotic resistant zoonotic pathogens which contaminate food animals and their products. individual activity of natural antimicrobials (eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, allyl isothiocyanate (ait)) and activity when paired with an antibiotic was studied using broth microdilution and checkerboard methods. in the latter assays, fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) values were calculated to characterize interactions between the inhibitors. bacteria tested were chosen because of their resistance to at least one antibiotic which had a known genetic basis. substantial susceptibility of these bacteria toward the natural antimicrobials and a considerable reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of the antibiotics were noted when paired combinations of antimicrobial and antibiotic were used. in the interaction study, thymol and carvacrol were found to be highly effective in reducing the resistance of salmonella typhimurium sgi 1 (tet a) to ampicillin, tetracycline, penicillin, bacitracin, erythromycin and novobiocin (fic<0.4) and resistance of streptococcus pyogenes ermb to erythromycin (fic<0.5). with escherichia coli n00  666, thymol and cinnamaldehyde were found to have a similar effect (fic<0.4) in reducing the mic's of ampicillin, tetracycline, penicillin, erythromycin and novobiocin. carvacrol, thymol (fic<0.3) and cinnamaldehyde (fic<0.4) were effective against staphylococcus aureus blaz and in reducing the mic's of ampicillin, penicillin and bacitracin. allyl isothiocyanate (ait) was effective in reducing the mic of erythromycin (fic<0.3) when tested against s. pyogenes. fewer combinations were found to be synergistic when the decrease in viable population (log dp) was calculated. together, fractional inhibitory concentrations < or = 0.5 and log dp<-1 indicated synergistic action between four natural antimicrobials and as many as three antibiotics to which these bacteria were normally resistant.

TI  == bactericidal performance of visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst with silver nanostructures.
AB  == background: titania dioxide (tio(2)) photocatalyst is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. visible-light responsive anion-doped tio(2) photocatalysts contain higher quantum efficiency under sunlight and can be used safely in indoor settings without exposing to biohazardous ultraviolet light. the antibacterial efficiency, however, remains to be further improved. methodology/principal findings: using thermal reduction method, here we synthesized silver-nanostructures coated tio(2) thin films that contain a high visible-light responsive antibacterial property. among our tested titania substrates including tio(2), carbon-doped tio(2) [tio(2) (c)] and nitrogen-doped  tio(2) [tio(2) (n)], tio(2) (n) showed the best performance after silver coating. the synergistic antibacterial effect results approximately 5 log reductions of surviving bacteria of escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii. scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that crystalline silver formed unique wire-like nanostructures on tio(2) (n) substrates, while formed relatively straight and thicker rod-shaped precipitates on the other two titania materials. conclusion/significance: our results suggested that proper forms of silver on various titania materials could  further influence the bactericidal property.

TI  == small variable segments constitute a major type of diversity of bacterial genomes at the species level.
AB  == background: analysis of large scale diversity in bacterial genomes has mainly focused on elements such as pathogenicity islands, or more generally, genomic islands. these comprise numerous genes and confer important phenotypes, which are present or absent depending on strains. we report that despite this widely accepted notion, most diversity at the species level is composed of much smaller  dna segments, 20 to 500 bp in size, which we call microdiversity. results: we performed a systematic analysis of the variable segments detected by multiple whole genome alignments at the dna level on three species for which the greatest  number of genomes have been sequenced: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. among the numerous sites of variability, 62 to 73% were loci of microdiversity, many of which were located within genes. they contribute to phenotypic variations, as 3 to 6% of all genes harbor microdiversity, and 1 to 9% of total genes are located downstream from a microdiversity locus. microdiversity loci are particularly abundant in genes encoding membrane proteins. in-depth analysis of the e. coli alignments shows that most of the diversity does not correspond to known mobile or repeated elements, and it is likely that they were generated by illegitimate recombination. an intriguing class of microdiversity includes small blocks of highly diverged sequences, whose origin is discussed. conclusions: this analysis  uncovers the importance of this small-sized genome diversity, which we expect to  be present in a wide range of bacteria, and possibly also in many eukaryotic genomes.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes spycep: a chemokine-inactivating protease with unique structural and biochemical features.
AB  == spycep is a 170-kda multidomain serine protease expressed on the surface of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes, which plays an important role in infection by catalyzing cleavage and inactivation of the neutrophil chemoattractant interleukin-8. in this study, we investigated the biochemical features and maturation process of spycep, starting from a recombinant form of the protease expressed and purified from escherichia coli. we show that active recombinant spycep differs from other bacterial proteases in that it is constituted by 2 noncovalently linked fragments derived from autocatalytic processing, an n-terminal fragment of 210 aa bearing one of the 3 catalytic triad residues, and  a 1369-residue c-terminal polypeptide containing the remaining 2 catalytic amino  acids. the same type of organization is present in the enzyme obtained from s. pyogenes. furthermore, n-terminal spycep is not involved in the folding of the mature enzyme. the 2 protease fragments were separately expressed in e. coli as soluble polypeptides that, when combined, reconstituted a fully active enzyme complex. therefore, spycep appears to possess a completely new structural architecture that has not been described so far for other microbial proteases.

AB  == ag-coated cnts hybrid nanoparticles (ag/cnts) were prepared by ultrasonic irradiation of dimethylformamide (dmf) and silver (i) acetate precursors in the presence of cnts. the morphology of ag/cnts was characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (tem) techniques. the nylon-6 powder and 1 wt% ag/cnts mixture was dispersed uniformly using a noncontact spinning technique. the dried mixture was melted in a single screw extrusion machine and then extruded through an orifice. extruded filaments were later stretched and stabilized by sequentially passing them through a set of tension adjusters and a secondary heater. the nylon-6/ag/cnt hybrid polymer nanocomposite (hpnc) fibers, which were of approximately 80 microm size, were tested for their  tensile properties. the failure stress and modulus of the extruded hpnc fibers (doped with 1% ag/cnts) was about 72.19 % and 342.62% higher than the neat extruded nylon-6 fiber, respectively. dsc results indicated an increase in the thermal stability and crystallization for hpnc fibers. the antibacterial activity of the ag-coated cnts, commercial ag, neat nylon-6 and plain cnts were evaluated. ag-coated cnts at 25 microg demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against four common bacterial pathogens as tested by the kirby-bauer assay. the mean diameters of the zones of inhibition were 27.9 +/- 6.72 mm, 19.4 +/- 3.64 mm, 21.9 +/- 4.33 mm, and 24.1 +/- 4.14 mm, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus  pyogenes, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. by comparison, those obtained using the broad spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 37.7 +/- 2.13 mm, 28.6 +/- 4.27 mm, 22.6 +/- 1.27 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.41 mm, respectively, for the same strains. the zones of inhibition obtained for nylon-6 ag-coated cnt powder at 25 microg were also high, ranging from 15.2 to 25.3 mm in contrast to commercial silver or neat nylon-6, which did not inhibit the bacterial strains tested. further, the nylon-6 nanocomposite fibers infused with ag/cnts inhibited bacterial growth by 11-20%. our results suggest that nylon nanocomposite fibers infused with ag-coated cnts have significant antimicrobial activity.

TI  == contribution of each of four superantigens to streptococcus equi-induced mitogenicity, gamma interferon synthesis, and immunity.
AB  == streptococcus equi is the causative agent of strangles, the most frequently diagnosed infectious disease of horses worldwide. the disease is characterized by abscessation and swelling of the lymph nodes of the head and neck, which can literally strangle the horse to death. s. equi produces four recently acquired phage-associated bacterial superantigens (sags; seeh, seei, seel, and seem) that  share homology with the mitogenic toxins of streptococcus pyogenes. the aim of this study was to characterize the contribution of each of these s. equi sags to  mitogenic activity in vitro and quantify the sag-neutralizing capacity of sera from naturally infected horses in order to better understand their role in pathogenicity. each of the sags was successfully cloned, and soluble proteins were produced in escherichia coli. seei, seel, and seem induced a dose-dependent  proliferative response in equine cd4 t lymphocytes and synthesis of gamma interferon (ifn-gamma). seeh did not stimulate equine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) but induced proliferation of asinine pbmc. allelic replacement mutants of s. equi strain 4047 with sequential deletion of the superantigen genes were generated. deletion of seei, seel, and seem completely abrogated the mitogenic activity and synthesis of ifn-gamma, in equine pbmc, of the strain 4047 culture supernatant. sera from naturally infected convalescent horses had only limited sag-neutralizing activities. we propose that s. equi sags play an important role in s. equi pathogenicity by stimulating an overzealous and inappropriate th1 response that may interfere with the development of an effective immune response.

TI  == a foreign protein incorporated on the tip of t3 pili in lactococcus lactis elicits systemic and mucosal immunity.
AB  == the use of lactococcus lactis to deliver a chosen antigen to the mucosal surface  has been shown to elicit an immune response in mice and is a possible method of vaccination in humans. the recent discovery on gram-positive bacteria of pili that are covalently attached to the bacterial surface and the elucidation of the  residues linking the major and minor subunits of such pili suggests that the presentation of an antigen on the tip of pili external to the surface of l. lactis might constitute a successful vaccine strategy. as a proof of principle, we have fused a foreign protein (the escherichia coli maltose-binding protein) to the c-terminal region of the native tip protein (cpa) of the t3 pilus derived from streptococcus pyogenes and expressed this fusion protein (mbp*) in l. lactis. we find that mbp* is incorporated into pili in this foreign host, as shown by western blot analyses of cell wall proteins and by immunogold electron microscopy. furthermore, since the mbp* on these pili retains its native biological activity, it appears to retain its native structure. mucosal immunization of mice with this l. lactis strain expressing pilus-linked mbp* results in production of both a systemic and a mucosal response (igg and iga antibodies) against the mbp antigen. we suggest that this type of mucosal vaccine delivery system, which we term uptop (for unhindered presentation on tips of pili), may provide an inexpensive and stable alternative to current mechanisms of immunization for many serious human pathogens.

TI  == protein c inhibitor--a novel antimicrobial agent.
AB  == protein c inhibitor (pci) is a heparin-binding serine proteinase inhibitor belonging to the family of serpin proteins. here we describe that pci exerts broad antimicrobial activity against bacterial pathogens. this ability is mediated by the interaction of pci with lipid membranes, which subsequently leads to their permeabilization. as shown by negative staining electron microscopy, treatment of escherichia coli or streptococcus pyogenes bacteria with pci triggers membrane disruption followed by the efflux of bacterial cytosolic contents and bacterial killing. the antimicrobial activity of pci is located to the heparin-binding site of the protein and a peptide spanning this region was found to mimic the antimicrobial activity of pci, without causing lysis or membrane destruction of eukaryotic cells. finally, we show that platelets can assemble pci on their surface upon activation. as platelets are recruited to the  site of a bacterial infection, these results may explain our finding that pci levels are increased in tissue biopsies from patients suffering from necrotizing  fasciitis caused by s. pyogenes. taken together, our data describe a new function for pci in innate immunity.

AB  == lysins are murein hydrolases produced by bacteriophage that act on the cell wall  of host bacteria to release progeny phages. research indicated that lysins could  kill bacteria effectively and specifically in vitro. to prepare recombinant bacteriophage lysin of streptococcus (plyc) and analyze its biological activity,  we obtained two genes of plyc named plyca and plycb by pcr amplification and inserted them into pet-32a(+), then transformed the recombinant expression vectors pet-32a(+)-plyca and pet-32a(+)-plycb into e. coli bl21(de3) respectively. after induction with 0.7 mmol/l iptg at 30 degrees c for 7 h, plyca and plycb were successfully expressed, sds-page analysis determined that they all constituted above 30% of the total cell proteins. after ni(2+)-nta affinity chromatography, the purity was more than 95%. with the denaturation and protein refolding, we gained the recombinant plyc. to determine its biological activity,  we adopted turbidimetry and plate count method. before and after lysin treatment, the cell morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results showed that the recombinant plyc could specifically cleavage streptococcus pyogenes (group a beta-hemolytic streptococci). under the incubation time of 60 min with 4 microg/ml plyc in streptococcus pyogenes dilution which od600 was 0.56, the germicidal effect was up to 99.6%, while sem observations showed that cell wall cracked and presented cell debris. this finding laid the foundation for the further study and achieving an effective treatment for streptococcal infection.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

TI  == characterization of a virulence-associated and cell-wall-located dnase of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == we investigated culture supernatant proteins from the m1 serotype of streptococcus pyogenes by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide mass mapping analysis, and characterized the single protein spots. among them, we analysed the spy0747 protein. this protein is homologous to the ssna protein, a cell-wall-located dnase expressed in streptococcus suis serotype 2. we designated the spy0747 protein as spna. spna protein was also detected in the insoluble fraction of whole-cell lysates using shotgun proteomic analysis, suggesting that  spna is also located in the cell wall. spna was expressed as a glutathione s-transferase-fusion protein in escherichia coli. we confirmed that the recombinant protein had dnase activity that was dependent on ca(2+) and mg(2+), like ssna. blood bactericidal assays and mouse infection model experiments showed that the spna knockout strain was less virulent than the parental strain, thus suggesting that spna could play an important role in virulence. using pcr, we found that the spna gene was present in all clinical s. pyogenes strains we examined. our results, together with a previous report identifying spy0747 as a surface-associated protein, suggest that spna is an important cell-wall-located dnase that is generally produced in s. pyogenes and is involved in virulence.

TI  == rapid exchange of bound adp on the staphylococcus aureus replication initiation protein dnaa.
AB  == in escherichia coli, regulatory inactivation of the replication initiator dnaa occurs after initiation as a result of hydrolysis of bound atp to adp, but it has been unknown how dnaa is controlled to coordinate cell growth and chromosomal replication in gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus. this study examined the roles of atp binding and its hydrolysis in the regulation of the s.  aureus dnaa activity. in vitro, s. aureus dnaa melted s. aureus oric in the presence of atp but not adp by a mechanism independent of atp hydrolysis. unlike  e. coli dnaa, binding of adp to s. aureus dnaa was unstable. as a result, at physiological concentrations of atp, adp bound to s. aureus dnaa was rapidly exchanged for atp, thereby regenerating the ability of dnaa to form the open complex in vitro. therefore, we examined whether formation of adp-dnaa participates in suppression of replication initiation in vivo. induction of the r318h mutant of the aaa+ sensor 2 protein, which has decreased intrinsic atpase activity, caused over-initiation of chromosome replication in s. aureus, suggesting that formation of adp-dnaa suppresses the initiation step in s. aureus. together with the biochemical features of s. aureus dnaa, the weak ability to convert atp-dnaa into adp-dnaa and the instability of adp-dnaa, these  results suggest that there may be unidentified system(s) for reducing the cellular ratio of atp-dnaa to adp-dnaa in s. aureus and thereby delaying the re-initiation of dna replication.

TI  == a toxin-antitoxin module as a target for antimicrobial development.
AB  == the emergence and spread of pathogenic bacteria that have become resistant to multiple antibiotics through lateral gene transfer have created the need of novel antimicrobials. toxin-antitoxin (ta) modules, which have been implicated in plasmid maintenance and stress management, are ubiquitous among plasmids from vancomycin or methicillin resistant bacteria. in the streptococcus pyogenes psm19035-encoded ta loci, the labile epsilon antitoxin binds to free zeta toxin and neutralizes it. when the zeta toxin is freed from the epsilon antitoxin, it induces a reversible state of growth arrest with a drastic reduction on the rate  of replication, transcription and translation. however, upon prolonged zeta toxin action, the cells can no longer be rescued from their stasis state. a compound that disrupts the epsilon.zeta interaction can be considered as an attractive antimicrobial agent. gene epsilon was fused to luc (luc-epsilon antitoxin) and zeta to the gfp gene (zeta-gfp). luc-epsilon or epsilon antitoxin neutralizes the toxic effect of the zeta or zeta-gfp toxin. in the absence of the antitoxin, free zeta or zeta-gfp triggers a reversible loss of cell proliferation, but the zetak46a-gfp variant fails to block growth. bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (bret) assay was developed for high-throughput screening (hts). to develop the proper controls, molecular dynamics studies were used to predict that the asp18 and/or glu22 residues might be relevant for epsilon.zeta interaction. luc-epsilon efficiently transfers the excited energy to the fluorescent acceptor  molecule (zeta-gfp or zetak46a-gfp) and rendered high bioluminescence bret signals. the exchange of asp18 to ala from zeta (d18a) affects luc-epsilon.zetad18a k46a-gfp interaction. in this study, we validate the hypothesis that it is possible to disrupt a ta module and offer a novel and unexploited targets to fight against antibiotic-resistant strains.

TI  == [investigation of bactericidal effect and nitric oxide responses of caco-2 epithelial cells and thp-1 macrophage cells against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli].
AB  == epithelial cells and macrophages contribute to innate immune responses by cell to cell interactions and releasing proinflammatory mediators. in this study, we aimed to illuminate the underlying mechanisms of contribution of macrophages and  epithelial cells in the struggle against pathogens. therefore, streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli activated caco-2 cells and thp-1 macrophage-like cells were investigated for their bactericidal activities and nitric oxide (no) production when they were alone, in contact with eachother and when their contact was blocked by continuing exposure of soluble mediators. caco-2 epithelial cells  and thp-1 macrophage cells were used as effector cells and s. pyogenes or e. coli as target cells and were incubated at an effector cell/target cell ratio of 1/1 in duplication in 24-well plates. after 5 hours incubation, supernatants were collected from each well for growth inhibition assay and were inoculated onto blood agar plates for s. pyogenes and eosin methylene blue agar plates for e. coli. following overnight incubation at 37 degrees c, bactericidal effect rate was calculated by counting the colony forming units. the supernatants were also collected after 5 and 24 hours incubation for measurement of no production by using griess reagent. bactericidal effect of caco-2 cells alone against s. pyogenes and e. coli were found 21.9% and 36.2%, when seperated from thp-1 cells  via an insert was 31.8% and 30.5%, and when cell-cell contact was established with thp-1 cells was 24.4% and 55.7%, respectively. bactericidal effect of thp-1  cells alone against s. pyogenes and e. coli was 27.7% and 63.9%, when seperated from caco-2 cells via an insert was %27.5 and 43.6%, and when cell-cell contact was established with caco-2 cells was 24.4% and 55.7%, respectively. as a result, we found that caco-2 epithelial cells and thp-1 macrophage cells had an antibacterial effect against s. pyogenes and e. coli (p < 0.05), and this effect  was higher in macrophage cells than epithelial cells. no levels in epithelial and/or macrophage cell culture supernatants collected after exposure to s. pyogenes and e. coli were significantly higher for s. pyogenes at 5 hours incubation and for e. coli at 24 hours incubation (p < 0.05). morever, it can be  concluded that macrophages played a more active role than epithelial cells in bactericidal effect and no response. besides, epithelial cells and macrophages activated each other more when they were in contact than when they were alone or  when their contact was blocked.

TI  == identification and characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase in streptococcus suis type 2.
AB  == streptococcus suis type 2 is a swine pathogen responsible for diverse diseases. although many virulent factors have been identified and studied, relatively little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of type 2. the aim of the study was to identify and understand the characterization of inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh). a 957-bp gene, impdh, was identified in the virulent s. suis serotype 2 (ss2), and analysis of the predicted impdh sequence revealed imp  dehydrogenase/gmp reductase domain. the gene encoding for the impdh of s. suis was cloned and sequenced. the dna sequence contained an open reading frame encoding for a 318 amino acid polypeptide exhibiting 23% sequence identity with the impdh from streptococcus pyogenes (yp281355) and streptococcus pneumoniae (zp00404150). using the pet(32) expression plasmid, the impdh gene was inducibly  overexpressed in escherichia coli to produce impdh with a hexahistidyl n-terminus to permit its purification. the (his)6 impdh protein was found to possess functional impdh enzymatic activity after the purification. the impdh-knockout ss2 mutant ( delta impdh) constructed in this study was slower in growth and one  ph unit higher than ss2-h after 6 h of culturing, and found to be attenuated in mouse models of infection for 2.5 times and not be capable of causing death in porcine models of infection in contrast with the parent ss2-h.

TI  == real-time polymerase chain reaction-based identification of bacteria in milk samples from bovine clinical mastitis with no growth in conventional culturing.
AB  == in more than 30% of milk samples from clinical and subclinical bovine mastitis, bacteria fail to grow even after 48 h of conventional culture. the "no-growth" samples are problematic for mastitis laboratories, veterinarians, and dairy producers. this study provides the first investigation of the bacteriological etiology of such samples, using a real-time pcr-based commercial reagent kit. the assay targets the dna of the 11 most common bacterial species or groups in mastitis and the staphylococcal blaz gene (responsible for penicillin resistance) and can identify and quantify bacterial cells even if dead or growth-inhibited. a study was made of 79 mastitic milk samples with no-growth bacteria in conventional culture, originating from cows with clinical mastitis. of the 79 samples, 34 (43%) were positive for 1 (32 samples) or 2 (2 samples) of the target bacteria. the positive findings included 11 staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci other than staphylococcus aureus), 10 streptococcus uberis, 2 streptococcus dysgalactiae, 6 corynebacterium bovis, 3 staph. aureus, 1 escherichia coli, 1 enterococcus, and 1 arcanobacterium pyogenes. the positive samples contained as many as 10(3) to 10(7) bacterial genome copies per milliliter of milk. this study demonstrates that in nearly half of the clinical mastitis cases in which conventional culture failed to detect bacteria, mastitis pathogens were still present, often in substantial quantities. the clearly elevated n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase activity values of the milk samples, together with clinical signs of the infected cows and quarters, confirmed the diagnosis of clinical mastitis and indicated that real-time, pcr-based bacterial findings are  able to reveal bacteriological etiology. we conclude that all common mastitis bacteria can occur in large quantities in clinical mastitis samples that exhibit  no growth in conventional culture, and that the real-time pcr assay is a useful tool for bacteriological diagnosis of such milk samples. low bacterial concentration is commonly speculated to explain the no-growth milk samples. this  hypothesis is not supported by the results of the current study.

TI  == combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in e. coli.
AB  == the increased synthesis of building blocks of ipp (isopentenyl diphosphate) and dmapp (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. using e. coli as a host, ipp and dmapp supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign mva (mevalonate) pathway into it. the mva pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-coa, and ipp and dmapp from mevalonate, respectively. the bottom portions of mva pathway from streptococcus pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous  mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. the e. coli harboring the bottom mva pathway of s. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. the top portions of mva pathway were also compared and the top mva pathway of e. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in e. coli. the whole mva pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of mva pathway of s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis, respectively. the recombinant e. coli harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without  exogenous mevalonate supplementation. when comparing various e. coli strains - mg1655, dh5alpha, s17-1, xl1-blue and bl21 - the dh5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. the recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/l at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).

TI  == substrate specificity of streptococcal unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolases for sulfated glycosaminoglycan.
AB  == unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (ugl) categorized into the glycoside hydrolase family 88 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of an unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan disaccharides, which are produced from mammalian extracellular  matrices through the beta-elimination reaction of polysaccharide lyases. here, we show enzyme characteristics of pathogenic streptococcal ugls and structural determinants for the enzyme substrate specificity. the putative genes for ugl and phosphotransferase system for amino sugar, a component of glycosaminoglycans, are assembled into a cluster in the genome of pyogenic and hemolytic streptococci such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, which produce extracellular hyaluronate lyase as a virulent factor. the ugls of these three streptococci were overexpressed in escherichia coli cells, purified, and characterized. streptococcal ugls degraded unsaturated hyaluronate  and chondroitin disaccharides most efficiently at approximately ph 5.5 and 37 degrees c. distinct from bacillus sp. gl1 ugl, streptococcal ugls preferred sulfated substrates. dna microarray and western blotting indicated that the enzyme was constitutively expressed in s. agalactiae cells, although the expression level increased in the presence of glycosaminoglycan. the crystal structure of s. agalactiae ugl (sagugl) was determined at 1.75 a resolution by x-ray crystallography. sagugl adopts alpha(6)/alpha(6)-barrel structure as a basic scaffold similar to bacillus ugl, but the arrangement of amino acid residues in the active site differs between the two. sagugl arg-236 was found to  be one of the residues involved in its activity for the sulfated substrate through structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis. this is the first report on the structure and function of streptococcal ugls.

AB  == background: iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous and evolutionarily ancient inorganic prosthetic groups, the biosynthesis of which depends on complex protein machineries. three distinct assembly systems involved in the maturation of cellular fe-s proteins have been determined, designated the nif, isc and suf systems. although well described in several organisms, these machineries are poorly understood in gram-positive bacteria. within the firmicutes phylum, the enterococcus spp. genus have recently assumed importance in clinical microbiology being considered as emerging pathogens for humans, wherein enterococcus faecalis  represents the major species associated with nosocomial infections. the aim of this study was to carry out a phylogenetic analysis in enterococcus faecalis v583 and a structural and conformational characterisation of it sufu protein. results: blast searches of the enterococcus genome revealed a series of genes with sequence similarity to the escherichia coli suf machinery of [fe-s] cluster biosynthesis, namely sufb, sufc, sufd and sufs. in addition, the e. coli iscu ortholog sufu was found to be the scaffold protein of enterococcus spp., containing all features considered essential for its biological activity, including conserved amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding (cys50,76,138 and asp52) and, phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship with orthologues from other gram-positive bacteria. molecular dynamics for structural determinations and molecular modeling using e. faecalis sufu primary sequence protein over the pdb:1su0 crystallographic model from streptococcus pyogenes were carried out with a subsequent 50 ns molecular dynamic trajectory. this presented a stable model, showing secondary structure modifications near the active site and conserved cysteine residues. molecular modeling using haemophilus influenzae iscu primary sequence over the pdb:1su0 crystal followed by a md trajectory was performed to analyse differences in the c-terminus region of gram-positive sufu and gram-negative orthologous proteins, in which several modifications in secondary structure were observed. conclusion:  the data describe the identification of the suf machinery for [fe-s] cluster biosynthesis present in the firmicutes genome, showing conserved sufb, sufc, sufd and sufs genes and the presence of the sufu gene coding for scaffold protein, instead of sufa; neither sufe nor sufr are present. primary sequences and structural analysis of the sufu protein demonstrated its structural-like pattern  to the scaffold protein iscu nearby on the isc machinery. e. faecalis sufu molecular modeling showed high flexibility over the active site regions, and demonstrated the existence of a specific region in firmicutes denoting the gram positive region (gpr), suggested as a possible candidate for interaction with other factors and/or regulators.

TI  == a fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  == it is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. these structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the  bacteria from the mature biofilm. in the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have  identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. when added exogenously to p. aeruginosa pao1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nm, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies.  this molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast candida albicans. active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefditoren against major community-acquired respiratory pathogens recently isolated in italy.
AB  == in this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren--a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin--and other comparator agents against 2,396 fresh isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections, collected from 6 clinical italian microbiology laboratories. on penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and streptococcus pyogenes, cefditoren demonstrated to be the most active antibiotic (mic(90)values of 0.03 and 0.06 mg/l respectively), showing only a slight decrease in potency on penicillin-intermediate and resistant pneumococci (mic(90)value 0.5 mg/l, 1.0 mg/l respectively). all the other comparators displayed mic(90 )values of 4 - 8 mg/l for penicillins and of 4 to >64 mg/l for the oral cephalosporins. cefditoren and levofloxacin were the most active against mssa (mic(90)0.5 mg/ml). cefditoren displayed a uniformly potent inhibitory activity (mic(90)of 0.03 mg/l) against all strains of haemophilus influenzae, regardless of their ampicillin resistance (mediated or not by beta-lactamase production), while against moraxella catarrhalis mic(90)values were higher against beta-lactamase-positive (0.25 mg/l). cefditoren was active also against klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli : in this case its activity was comparable with that of levofloxacin. in conclusion, cefditoren, due to its potent activity, is a new effective therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == [nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  == we conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout japan according to the special survey plan  to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral cpfx. results of the first special survey  (2001) were already reported in this journal. the current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout japan to determine susceptibility to cpfx and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between january and june 2005. the results of cpfx in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. the minimum inhibitory concentration of cpfx at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (mic90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. however, the cpfx-susceptibility rate of escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. for morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of cpfx tended to increase with time. the cpfx-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for p. aeruginosa and 67.9% for stenotrophomonas maltophilia. with the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of  respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for cpfx, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. these susceptibility rates for cpfx were similar to the rates for cefozopran and  imipenem. these values generally indicated favorable cpfx susceptibility testing  results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of cpfx particularly against gram-negative bacteria. further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of e. coli, m. morganii, and p. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.

TI  == the bicarbonate transporter is essential for bacillus anthracis lethality.
AB  == in the pathogenic bacterium bacillus anthracis, virulence requires induced expression of the anthrax toxin and capsule genes. elevated co2/bicarbonate levels, an indicator of the host environment, provide a signal ex vivo to increase expression of virulence factors, but the mechanism underlying induction  and its relevance in vivo are unknown. we identified a previously uncharacterized abc transporter (bas2714-12) similar to bicarbonate transporters in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, which is essential to the bicarbonate induction of  virulence gene expression. deletion of the genes for the transporter abolished induction of toxin gene expression and strongly decreased the rate of bicarbonate uptake ex vivo, demonstrating that the bas2714-12 locus encodes a bicarbonate abc transporter. the bicarbonate transporter deletion strain was avirulent in the a/j mouse model of infection. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, which prevent the interconversion of co2 and bicarbonate, significantly affected toxin expression only in the absence of bicarbonate or the bicarbonate transporter, suggesting that carbonic anhydrase activity is not essential to virulence factor induction and that bicarbonate, and not co2, is the signal essential for virulence induction. the identification of this novel bicarbonate transporter essential to  virulence of b. anthracis may be of relevance to other pathogens, such as streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, borrelia burgdorferi, and vibrio cholera that regulate virulence factor expression in response to co2/bicarbonate, and suggests it may be a target for antibacterial intervention.

TI  == experiences in prevention and control of antibiotic resistance in slovenia.
AB  == during 1991-1999 a significant increase of consumption of macrolides and fluoroquinolones was observed in slovenia,and this was associated with significant increase of resistance of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus  pyogenes to macrolides and escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones, respectively.between 1999 and 2007 the prevalence of s. pneumoniae resistant to erythromycin increased from 3.7% to 16.8% even though the use of macrolides in the same period decreased from 3.81 to 2.43 defined daily doses (ddd) per 1,000 inhabitants and per day. the co-resistance and the spread of resistant clones were the reason for constant increase in macrolide resistance. slovenia is one of the few european countries with decreasing prevalence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in hospital care during the last years. as a result  of control measures introduced in 1999,the mrsa prevalence rates decreased from 21.4% in 2000 to 8.3% in 2007.

TI  == inferring genomic flux in bacteria.
AB  == acquisition and loss of genetic material are essential forces in bacterial microevolution. they have been repeatedly linked with adaptation of lineages to new lifestyles, and in particular, pathogenicity. comparative genomics has the potential to elucidate this genetic flux, but there are many methodological challenges involved in inferring evolutionary events from collections of genome sequences. here we describe a model-based method for using whole-genome sequences to infer the patterns of genome content evolution. a fundamental property of our  model is that it allows the rates at which genetic elements are gained or lost to vary in time and from one lineage to another. our approach is purely sequence based, and does not rely on gene identification. we show how inference can be performed under our model and illustrate its use on three datasets from francisella tularensis, streptococcus pyogenes, and escherichia coli. in all three examples, we found interesting variations in the rates of genetic material  gain and loss, which strongly correlate with their lifestyle. the algorithms we describe are implemented in a computer software named genoplast.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == enumeration of mycobacterium leprae using real-time pcr.
AB  == mycobacterium leprae is not cultivable in axenic media, and direct microscopic enumeration of the bacilli is complex, labor intensive, and suffers from limited  sensitivity and specificity. we have developed a real-time pcr assay for quantifying m. leprae dna in biological samples. primers were identified to amplify a shared region of the multicopy repeat sequence (rlep) specific to m. leprae and tested for sensitivity and specificity in the taqman format. the assay was specific for m. leprae and able to detect 10 fg of purified m. leprae dna, or approximately 300 bacteria in infected tissues. we used the rlep taqman pcr to assess the short and long-term growth results of m. leprae in foot pad tissues obtained from conventional mice, a gene knock-out mouse strain, athymic nude mice, as well as from reticuloendothelial tissues of m. leprae-infected nine-banded armadillos. we found excellent correlative results between estimates  from rlep taqman pcr and direct microscopic counting (combined r = 0.98). the rlep taqman pcr permitted rapid analysis of batch samples with high reproducibility and is especially valuable for detection of low numbers of bacilli. molecular enumeration is a rapid, objective and highly reproducible means to estimate the numbers of m. leprae in tissues, and application of the technique can facilitate work with this agent in many laboratories.

TI  == unusual resistance patterns in macrolide-resistant streptococcus pyogenes harbouring erm(a).
AB  == background: we identified erm(a)-harbouring streptococcus pyogenes that expressed three variant phenotypes: (1) low-level resistance to erythromycin (mics 1-4 mg/l) but high azithromycin mics in absolute terms (16-64 mg/l; n=6); (2) same as (1) but with a high clindamycin mic (256 mg/l; n=1); and (3) high-level constitutive mls (cmls) resistance (n=1). here we analysed the genetic basis of these novel phenotypes. methods: the presence of erm(a) and the absence of macrolide/lincosamide resistance genes erm(b), mef and cfr were confirmed by pcr. erm(a), 23s rrna, l4 and l22 genes were sequenced. mutant erm(a) genes were cloned and electrotransformed into the macrolide-susceptible escherichia coli ag100a. clonality was determined by emm typing and pfge. effects of the identified mutations on free energy changes (deltag) and putative configurations  of the leader sequence were studied in silico. results: point mutations (g98a, a137c, c140t and g205a) were observed in the erm(a) regulatory region of all eight erm(a)-harbouring s. pyogenes. five and two isolates belonged to emm77 and  emm89 clones, respectively, and one isolate was an emm1. e. coli transformed with mutant erm(a) harbouring g98a, a137c or c140t mutations (phenotypes 1 and 2) did  not express high-level azithromycin or clindamycin resistance. however, cmls resistance was clearly observed in transformants with erm(a) harbouring both a137c and g205a mutations (phenotype 3). in silico analysis showed that deltag was minor except for the g205a mutation. secondary structure predictions further  showed that the a137c and g205a mutations together abolished the hairpin sequestering the ribosome-binding and initiation sites of the erm(a) gene, explaining the cmls phenotype 3. conclusions: we report point mutations in the erm(a) regulatory region leading to constitutive methylase expression and the presence of additional, as yet unidentified mechanisms mediating high-level azithromycin and clindamycin resistance in erm(a)-harbouring s. pyogenes.

TI  == beta-defensin antibiotic peptides in the innate immunity of the buffalo: in vivo  and in vitro studies.
AB  == beta-defensin antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional biomolecules, which are  a major component of the oxygen-independent microbicidal system of buffalo polymorphonuclear (pmn) cells. they have great potential for use as proteomic biomarkers of host cell responses in the presence of microbial agents. on purifying these peptides by rp-hplc, four defensin peptides were revealed. the results from testing against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, candida albicans, rinderpest virus (rpv) and newcastle disease virus (ndv), showed that the peptides possessed antimicrobial and antiviral activities. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values varied according to the peptide amounts and the exposure time. furthermore, an increase  in the levels of these cationic antimicrobial peptides was apparent in milk obtained from natural cases of mastitis, as compared to the levels in normal milk. maldi-tof-based amino acid sequencing confirmed the expression of two beta-defensins (lap and bnbd-2) in mastitis milk. a comparison of peptide sequences revealed that buffalo lap and bnbd-2 share 98.6% and 100% sequence identity, respectively, with those of cattle. in vitro, bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bvdv) infection was shown to induce the expression of the beta-defensin gene, as evidenced by the pcr amplification of cdna with specific primers. the determination of the enhanced expression of beta-defensin peptides in mastitis milk and in pmn cells, can be considered as an advanced approach to the assessment of cellular and molecular responses to cell injury. it is hoped that in vitro studies on phagocytes such as pmn cells and other cell lines, will eventually replace the use of animals in elucidating the roles of these cytokines in response to microbe-derived cell damage. it will also be possible to use defensins as biomarkers to correlate failure in host cell defence systems with peptide heterogeneity.

TI  == prolonged exposure to bacterial toxins downregulated expression of toll-like receptors in mesenchymal stromal cell-derived osteoprogenitors.
AB  == background: human mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs, also known as mesenchymal stem cells) are multipotent cells with potential therapeutic value. owing to their osteogenic capability, mscs may be clinically applied for facilitating osseointegration in dental implants or orthopedic repair of bony defect. however, whether wound infection or oral microflora may interfere with the growth and osteogenic differentiation of human mscs remains unknown. this study investigated whether proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mscs would be affected by potent gram-positive and gram-negative derived bacterial toxins commonly found in human settings. results: we selected lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from streptococcus pyogenes as our toxins of choice. our findings showed both lps and lta did not affect msc proliferation, but prolonged lps challenge upregulated the osteogenic differentiation of mscs, as assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition. because toll-like receptors (tlrs), in particularly tlr4 and tlr2, are important for the  cellular responsiveness to lps and lta respectively, we evaluated their expression profiles serially from mscs to osteoblasts by quantitative pcr. we found that during osteogenic differentiation, msc-derived osteoprogenitors gradually expressed tlr2 and tlr4 by day 12. but under prolonged incubation with  lps, msc-derived osteoprogenitors had reduced tlr2 and tlr4 gene expression. this peculiar response to lps suggests a possible adaptive mechanism when mscs are subjected to continuous exposure with bacteria. conclusion: in conclusion, our findings support the potential of using human mscs as a biological graft, even under a bacterial toxin-rich environment.

AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus [pnc]) is a causative agent of many infectious diseases, including pneumonia, septicemia, otitis media, and conjunctivitis. there have been documented conjunctivitis outbreaks in which nontypeable (nt), nonencapsulated pnc has been identified as the etiological agent. the use of mass spectrometry to comparatively and differentially analyze protein and peptide profiles of whole-cell microorganisms remains somewhat uncharted. in this report, we discuss a comparative proteomic analysis between nt s. pneumoniae conjunctivitis outbreak strains (cpnc) and other known typeable or  nt pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates (including pnc tigr4 and r6, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes) and nonstreptococcal isolates (including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) as controls. cpnc cells and controls were grown to mid-log phase, harvested, and subsequently treated with a 10% trifluoroacetic acid-sinapinic acid matrix mixture. protein and peptide fragments of the whole-cell bacterial isolate-matrix combinations ranging in size from 2 to 14 kda were evaluated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. additionally random forest analytical tools and dendrogramic representations (genesis) suggested similarities and clustered the isolates into distinct clonal groups, respectively. also, a peak list of protein and peptide masses was obtained and compared to a known pnc protein mass library, in which a peptide common and unique to cpnc isolates was tentatively identified. information gained from this  study will lead to the identification and validation of proteins that are commonly and exclusively expressed in cpnc strains which could potentially be used as a biomarker in the rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal conjunctivitis.

AB  == enzymes that share the (beta/alpha) 8-barrel fold catalyze a diverse range of reactions. many utilize phosphorylated substrates and share a conserved c-terminal (beta/alpha) 2-quarter barrel subdomain that provides a binding motif  for the dianionic phosphate group. we recently reported functional and structural studies of d-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase (rpe) from streptococcus pyogenes that catalyzes the equilibration of the pentulose 5-phosphates d-ribulose 5-phosphate and d-xylulose 5-phosphate in the pentose phosphate pathway [j. akana, a. a. fedorov, e. fedorov, w. r. p. novack, p. c. babbitt, s. c. almo, and j. a. gerlt (2006) biochemistry 45, 2493-2503]. we now report functional and structural studies of d-allulose 6-phosphate 3-epimerase (alse) from escherichia  coli k-12 that catalyzes the equilibration of the hexulose 6-phosphates d-allulose 6-phosphate and d-fructose 6-phosphate in a catabolic pathway for d-allose. alse and rpe prefer their physiological substrates but are promiscuous  for each other's substrate. the active sites (rpe complexed with d-xylitol 5-phosphate and alse complexed with d-glucitol 6-phosphate) are superimposable (as expected from their 39% sequence identity), with the exception of the phosphate binding motif. the loop following the eighth beta-strand in alse is one residue longer than the homologous loop in rpe, so the binding site for the hexulose 6-phosphate substrate/product in alse is elongated relative to that for  the pentulose 5-phosphate substrate/product in rpe. we constructed three single-residue deletion mutants of the loop in alse, deltat196, deltas197 and deltag198, to investigate the structural bases for the differing substrate specificities; for each, the promiscuity is altered so that d-ribulose 5-phosphate is the preferred substrate. the changes in k cat/ k m are dominated by changes in k cat, suggesting that substrate discrimination results from differential transition state stabilization. in both alse and rpe, the phosphate  group hydrogen bonds not only with the conserved motif but also with an active site loop following the sixth beta-strand, providing a potential structural mechanism for coupling substrate binding with catalysis.

TI  == determination of antibacterial activity of polyenzyme preparations gumseb using in vitro methods.
AB  == a novel polyenzyme formulation gumseb developed by advanced enzyme technologies ltd, thane and speciality biochemicals co., usa, was tested for antibacterial properties using atcc strains and clinical isolates of salmonella typhi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. a modified antibiotic susceptibility test  was used for the purpose. s. aureus, s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were found to  be sensitive to the formulation at the chosen concentration. next, to study the interaction between gumseb and currently used antibiotic, a checkerboard minimum  inhibitory concentrations (mic) was carried out for each organism. the assay was  carried out with the aim of establishing whether the polyenzyme formulation had any potentiating effect on the antibiotic of choice. synergistic effect was established when gumseb was used in conjunction with penicillin against s. pyogenes. partial synergy was established when it was used in conduction with ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa and with ciprofloxacin against methicillin sensitive, coagulase positive s. aureus. antagonism was established when it was used in conjunction with ampicillin against e. coli, with ciprofloxacin against s. typhi and coagulase negative staphylococcal strain. the results indicate that  gumseb can be used in conjunction with those antibiotics with which a synergistic or a partially synergistic effect could be shown, as in the case of p. aerugionosa and s. aureus. these findings have particular importance since these  organisms are responsible for hospital based infections and are notorious for antibiotic resistance. in cases where antagonism was established, it should not be used in combination with that particular antibiotic. however, it can be used individually since it has proved to have antibacterial activity and mic could be  determined for all five commonly encountered pathogens. therefore, it has the potential of being a novel broad range antibacterial drug. these findings are significant given the alarming rise in incidence of antibiotic resistance in most clinically important pathogens.

TI  == lambdasa2 prophage endolysin requires cpl-7-binding domains and amidase-5 domain  for antimicrobial lysis of streptococci.
AB  == streptococcal pathogens contribute to a wide variety of human and livestock diseases. the routine use of antibiotics to battle these pathogens has produced a new class of multidrug-resistant streptococci. thus, there is a need for new antimicrobials. bacteriophage endolysins (peptidoglycan hydrolases) comprise one  group of new antimicrobials that are reportedly refractory to resistance development. the lambdasa2 prophage endolysin gene was recently isolated from a group b streptococcal genome, expressed on an escherichia coli plasmid, and shown by homology screening and biochemical analysis to harbor an amidase-5 (endopeptidase) domain, an amidase-4 (glycosidase) domain, and two cpl-7 cell wall-binding domains. in this study, turbidity reduction and plate lysis assays indicate that this hydrolase shows strong lytic activity toward streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus equi, ges, and ggs. deletion analysis indicates that the n-terminal endopeptidase domain with both cpl-7 domains can lyse with a higher specific activity than the  full-length protein (against some strains). this dual cpl-7 domain truncated version also shows weak lytic activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and the coagulase negative staphylococci, staphylococcus xylosus. the truncated constructs harboring the glycosidase domain are virtually inactive, showing only minimal activity on plate lysis assays.

AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  == background: the antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. objective: to investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. methods: the activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. the validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. the inhibition zones of the discs were measured. results: mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on e. coli, whereas they had no effects on p. aeruginosa. lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, s. pyogenes and e. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5%  showed no activity on e. faecalis and inhibited s. pyogenes only at double doses. it was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. conclusion: in the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.

TI  == single-chain variable fragment antibodies selected by phage display against the sporozoite surface antigen p23 of cryptosporidium parvum.
AB  == cryptosporidium parvum, an apicomplexan parasite transmitted via animal fecal wastes, is the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis. clones were selected from 2  synthetic naive human single-chain variable fragment (scfv) phagemid libraries that bound to the recombinant p23 protein of c. parvum. panning the tomlinson i and j phagemid libraries resulted in 6 distinct clones. two clones had full-length scfv sequences, while the remaining clones were either truncated or missing a section of the heavy chain. despite these differences, all clones were  able to detect both native c. parvum proteins and recombinant p23. none of the selected clones cross-reacted with escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, giardia lamblia (cysts or trophozoites), or with s16, another dominant surface antigen on c. parvum sporozoites. clones expressed as the scfv-giiip fusion construct in soluble form detected c. parvum.  panning from naive libraries is a useful method for isolation and identification  of recombinant antibodies that have the potential for use in pathogen detection and immunotherapy.

TI  == in vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  == background: antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. in this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. methods: the antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, entecoccus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes,  pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. ciprofloxacine discs (cip, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. minimal inhibition concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. results: no inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of e. coli. the inhibition rates of ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of cip. whereas mic and mbc  values of ketamine for s. aureus and s. pyogenes were 500 microg ml(-1), mic and  mbc values for p. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg ml(-1). for other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. conclusions: ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. we thought that it will be proper to use ketamine  hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.

TI  == nrdi essentiality for class ib ribonucleotide reduction in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the streptococcus pyogenes genome harbors two clusters of class ib ribonucleotide reductase genes, nrdhef and nrdf*i*e*, and a second stand-alone nrdi gene, designated nrdi2. we show that both clusters are expressed simultaneously as two  independent operons. the nrdef enzyme is functionally active in vitro, while the  nrde*f* enzyme is not. the nrdf* protein lacks three of the six highly conserved  iron-liganding side chains and cannot form a dinuclear iron site or a tyrosyl radical. in vivo, on the other hand, both operons are functional in heterologous  complementation in escherichia coli. the nrdf*i*e* operon requires the presence of the nrdi* gene, and the nrdhef operon gained activity upon cotranscription of  the heterologous nrdi gene from streptococcus pneumoniae, while neither nrdi* nor nrdi2 from s. pyogenes rendered it active. our results highlight the essential role of the flavodoxin nrdi protein in vivo, and we suggest that it is needed to  reduce met-nrdf, thereby enabling the spontaneous reformation of the tyrosyl radical. the nrdi* flavodoxin may play a more direct role in ribonucleotide reduction by the nrdf*i*e* system. we discuss the possibility that the nrdf*i*e*  operon has been horizontally transferred to s. pyogenes from mycoplasma spp.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == the human cxc chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2)/cxcl6 possesses membrane-disrupting properties and is antibacterial.
AB  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2)/cxcl6 is a cxc chemokine expressed by macrophages and epithelial and mesenchymal cells during inflammation. through binding and activation of its receptors (cxcr1 and cxcr2), it exerts neutrophil-activating and angiogenic activities. here we show that gcp-2/cxcl6 itself is antibacterial. antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria of relevance to mucosal infections was seen at  submicromolar concentrations (minimal bactericidal concentration at which 50% of  strains tested were killed, 0.063 +/- 0.01 to 0.37 +/- 0.03 mum). in killed bacteria, gcp-2/cxcl6 associated with bacterial surfaces, which showed membrane disruption and leakage. a structural prediction indicated the presence of three antiparallel nh(2)-terminal beta-sheets and a short amphipathic cooh-terminal alpha-helix; the latter feature is typical of antimicrobial peptides. however, when the synthetic derivatives corresponding to the nh(2)-terminal (50 amino acids) and cooh-terminal (19 amino acids, corresponding to the putative alpha-helix) regions were compared, higher antibacterial activity was observed for the nh(2)-terminus-derived peptide, indicating that the holopeptide is necessary for full antibacterial activity. an artificial model of bacterial membranes confirmed these findings. the helical content of gcp-2/cxcl6 in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide or negatively charged membranes was studied by circular dichroism. as with many antibacterial peptides, membrane disruption by gcp-2/cxcl6 was dose-dependently reduced in the presence of nacl, which, we here demonstrate, inhibited the binding of the peptide to the bacterial surface. compared with cxc chemokines ena-78/cxcl5 and nap-2/cxcl7, gcp-2/cxcl6 showed a 90-fold-higher antibacterial activity. taken together, gcp/cxcl6, in addition to its chemotactic and angiogenic properties, is likely to contribute to direct antibacterial activity during localized infection.

TI  == the cbs subdomain of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase regulates purine nucleotide turnover.
AB  == inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh) catalyses the rate-limiting step in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. impdh has an evolutionary conserved cbs subdomain of unknown function. the subdomain can be deleted without impairing the in vitro impdh catalytic activity and is the site for mutations associated with human retinitis pigmentosa. a guanine-prototrophic escherichia coli strain, mp101, was constructed with the subdomain sequence deleted from the chromosomal gene for impdh. the atp content was substantially elevated in mp101 whereas the gtp content was slighty reduced. the activities of impdh, adenylosuccinate synthetase and gmp reductase were two to threefold lower in mp101 crude extracts  compared with the bw25113 wild-type strain. guanine induced a threefold reduction in the mp101 atp pool and a fourfold increase in the gtp pool within 10 min of addition to growing cells; this response does not result from the reduced impdh activity or starvation for guanylates. in vivo kinetic analysis using 14-c tracers and 33-p pulse-chasing revealed mutation-associated changes in purine nucleotide fluxes and turnover rates. we conclude that the cbs subdomain of impdh may coordinate the activities of the enzymes of purine nucleotide metabolism and  is essential for maintaining the normal atp and gtp pool sizes in e. coli.

TI  == secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB  == objectives: the intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. antibacterial protection is provided in part by paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. the mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with crohn's ileitis. in the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small  intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying  mucus and the luminal content. methods: preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by n-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. results: the secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. the extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). a spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. conclusion: these findings show that secreted antimicrobial  peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. this distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriophage lysin (ply700) from streptococcus uberis.
AB  == the antibacterial properties of bacteriophage lytic enzymes may be of importance  in future mastitis control programs. a prophage was isolated from a strain of streptococcus uberis (atcc 700407) following exposure to mitomycin c. partial sequencing of the phage dna revealed a putative lysin based on sequence similarity to other streptococcal phage lysins. the putative lysin (ply700) was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli, and chromatographically purified. addition of the purified ply700 to bacterial suspensions of s. uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus dysgalactiae caused a rapid, calcium-dependent lysis while there was little activity against streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, or e. coli. killing of s. uberis in milk by ply700 (50 microg/ml) was confirmed by plate count assay. activity was related to the initial concentration of bacteria in that 31% killing (p<0.05) was observed with an inoculating dose of approximately 4500 cfu/ml, while 81% killing (p<0.01) was observed when the inoculum was reduced to approximately 600 cfu/ml. in contrast, complete sterilization was observed in parallel cultures suspended in assay buffer indicating that factors in milk are able to neutralize the lysin. functional characterization of the c-terminal domain, as a component of a gfp fusion protein, revealed its calcium-dependent ability to bind to s. uberis. the  c-terminal domain may have utility in targeting s. uberis while it remains to be  determined if the lysin by itself has sufficient potency in milk for effective use in the control of s. uberis mastitis.

TI  == the surface protein shr of streptococcus pyogenes binds heme and transfers it to  the streptococcal heme-binding protein shp.
AB  == background: the heme acquisition machinery in streptococcus pyogenes is believed  to consist of the surface proteins, shr and shp, and heme-specific atp-binding cassette transporter htsabc. shp has been shown to rapidly transfer its heme to the lipoprotein component, htsa, of htsabc. the function of shr and the heme source of shp have not been established. results: the objective of this study was to determine whether shr binds heme and is a heme source of shp. to achieve the objective, recombinant shr protein was prepared. the purified shr displays a spectrum typical of hemoproteins, indicating that shr binds heme and acquires heme from escherichia coli hemoproteins in vivo. spectral analysis of shr and shp isolated from a mixture of shr and heme-free shp (aposhp) indicates that shr and  aposhp lost and gained heme, respectively; whereas shr did not efficiently lose its heme in incubation with apohtsa under the identical conditions. these results suggest that shr directly transfers its heme to shp. in addition, the rates of heme transfer from human hemoglobin to aposhp are close to those of simple ferric heme dissociation from hemoglobin, suggesting that methemoglobin does not directly transfer its heme to aposhp. conclusion: we have demonstrated that recombinant shr can acquire heme from e. coli hemoproteins in vivo and appears to directly transfer its heme to shp and that shp appears not to directly acquire heme from human methemoglobin. these results suggest the possibility that shr is  a source of heme for shp and that the shr-to-shp heme transfer is a step of the heme acquisition process in s. pyogenes. further characterization of the shr/shp/htsa system would advance our understanding of the mechanism of heme acquisition in s. pyogenes.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of peptides derived from human beta-2 glycoprotein i is inhibited by protein h and m1 protein from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == during the last years, the importance of antibacterial peptides has attracted considerable attention. we report here that peptides derived from the fifth domain of beta-2 glycoprotein i (beta(2)gpi), a human heparin binding plasma protein, have antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen that can survive and grow in human blood, has developed mechanisms to escape the attack by these peptides. thus, protein h and m1 protein, two surface proteins of the highly pathogenic s. pyogenes ap1 strain, bind full-length beta(2)gpi and thereby prevent the processing of beta(2)gpi by proteases from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) into antibacterial peptides. in addition, protein h and m1 protein, released from the bacterial cell wall by pmn-derived proteases, bind to, and inhibit the activity of, beta(2)gpi-derived antibacterial peptides. taken together, the data suggest that the interaction between the streptococcal proteins and beta(2)gpi or beta(2)gpi-derived peptides presents a novel mechanism to resist an antibacterial attack by beta(2)gpi-cleavage products.

AB  == screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 turkish plants was conducted. antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. extracts of tussilago farfara leaves, helichyrsum plicatum flowers,  solanum dulcamara aerial parts and urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory  activity against s. pyogenes, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (lc50 was <1000 mg l(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. for radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg l(-1) and 10,000 mg l(-1)). at low concentration (10,000 mg l(-1)), s. dulcamara aerial parts and primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with s. dulcamara aerial parts.

TI  == dental implants with locking taper connection versus screwed connection: microbiologic and scanning electron microscope study.
AB  == the aim of this study is to carry out an analysis of the fixture-abutment interfaces (fai), comparing different connection systems, to evaluate the role of geometric discrepancy, which is present between the abutment and the fixture, in  favoring the permeability to bacterial colonization. two types of commercially available fai were studied, 16 screwed fai (sweden-martina italia) (4 of o 3.8 mm diameter, 4 of o 4.7 mm diameter, 4 of o 5.7 mm diameter and 4 of o 6.7 mm diameter) and 4 fai (bicon) (o 3.5mm diameter). the assays were carried out in vitro, placing the different dental implants in contact with broth culture of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes to test the infiltration inside the fai. furthermore, scanning electron  microscope (sem) analysis was carried out to evaluate the gap at the fixture-abutment interface. in all the locking taper fai and in the screwed fai with a diameter of 3.8 mm there was no trace of bacterial infiltration of the species examined. in the screwed fai with a diameter of 4.7 mm, 5.7 mm and 6.7 mm there was an increasing level of bacterial infiltration in relationship to the diameter. therefore, this paper shows that there exists an important correlation  between the diameter of the screwed implant and the permeability to microbic infiltration that is directly proportional to the diameter of the implant.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == sipa is required for pilus formation in streptococcus pyogenes serotype m3.
AB  == pili are a major surface feature of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]). the t3 pilus is composed of a covalently linked polymer of protein t3 (formerly orf100 or fct3) with an ancillary protein, cpa, attached. a putative signal peptidase, sipa (also called lepa), has been identified in several pilus gene clusters of gas. we demonstrate that the sipa2 allele of a gas serotype m3 strain is required for synthesis of t3 pili. heterologous expression in escherichia coli showed that sipa2, along with the pilus backbone protein t3 and the sortase srtc2, is required for polymerization of the t3 protein. in addition, we found that sipa2 is also required for linkage  of the ancillary pilin protein cpa to polymerized t3. despite partial conservation of motifs of the type i signal peptidase family proteins, sipa lacks the highly conserved and catalytically important serine and lysine residues of these enzymes. substitution of alanine for either of the two serine residues closest to the expected location of an active site serine demonstrated that these serine residues are both dispensable for t3 polymerization. therefore, it seems unlikely that sipa functions as a signal peptidase. however, a t3 protein mutated at the p-1 position of the signal peptide cleavage site (alanine to arginine) was unstable in the presence of sipa2, suggesting that there is an interaction between sipa and t3. a possible chaperone-like function of sipa2 in t3 pilus formation is discussed.

TI  == inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  == among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. we have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, max1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. in experiments where max1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (cfus)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) cfus/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. results show that the hydrogel surface is  active against gram-positive (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus pyogenes) and gram-negative (klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. live-dead assays  employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. in addition, the surface of max1 hydrogels was shown to  cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient e. coli ml-35. these data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human  erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. these material attributes make max1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for biosynthesis of hyaluronic acid.
AB  == engineering of hyaluronic acid (ha) biosynthetic pathway in recombinant escherichia coli as production host is reported in this work. a hyaluronic acid synthase (has) gene, sphasa, from sreptococcus pyogenes with the start codon gtg  to atg mutant, was expressed in recombinant e. coli with or without the genes ugd, galf and glmu, which are analogs of hasb, hasc and hasd from streptococcus,  respectively, encoding udp-glucose 6-dehygrogenase, glucose-1-p uridyltransferase, and n-acetyl glucosamine uridyltransferase enzymes in the ha biosynthetic pathway. the single, double and triple organized artificial operons  of sphasa, ugd, galf and glmu were designed and constructed using the inducible plasmid backbone of pmbad. only the triple expression recombinant, top10/pmbad-spabc, generated a relatively high titer of ha (approximately 48 mg/l at 48 h), indicating that both of the enzymes encoded by ugd and galf are essential for ha biosynthesis. a new gene of ssehasa with identical protein sequence of sehas from streptococcus equisimilis, was artificially synthesized after substituting all of the rare codons in the natural sehasa. the ha titer at  24 h flask culture increased to approximately 190 mg/l in sseab and 160 mg/l in sseabc, respectively. sorbitol could be used as another carbon source for ha accumulation, and the metabolic pathway for ha synthesis in a recombinant e. coli was presented. the concentration of mg(2+) cofactor of ha synthase was optimized  and a cell growth inhibition phenomenon was observed during ha accumulation. molecular weight (mw) measurements revealed that the mean mw of ha produced from  the recombinant e. coli under different conditions ranges from approximately 3.5x10(5) to 1.9x10(6)da, indicating that the recombinant e. coli can be used as  a potential host candidate for industrial production of ha.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of a novel propolis formulation (actichelated propolis).
AB  == aims: this study compared in vitro activities of actichelated propolis (a multicomposite material obtained with mechano-chemichal activation) and of a hydroalcoholic extract of propolis. methods and results: minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), determined by means of microdilution broth method, against five strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa, showed a greater  potency of actichelated propolis (mic range: 0.016-4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)) in respect to the hydroalcoholic extract (mic range: 0.08-21.4 mg flavonoids ml(-1)). concentrations of actichelated propolis active against adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and herpes virus type 1 were at least 10 times lower than those of the hydroalcoholic extract. preincubation of strep. pyogenes and h. influenzae with subinhibitory concentrations of actichelated propolis (1/4 and 1/8 x mic) significantly reduced the number of bacteria that adhered to human buccal cells. conclusions: actichelated propolis has proven to possess antibacterial and antiviral activity higher than a hydroalcoholic extract, being also able to interfere on bacterial adhesion to human oral cells.  significance and impact of the study: this new formulation of propolis showing better antimicrobial and physical characteristics could improve the application of propolis in respiratory tract infections.

TI  == the catabolite control protein ccpa binds to pmga and influences expression of the virulence regulator mga in the group a streptococcus.
AB  == carbon catabolite repression (ccr) allows bacteria to alter metabolism in response to the availability of specific sugar sources, and increasing evidence suggests that ccr is involved in regulating virulence gene expression in many pathogens. a scan of the m1 sf370 group a streptococcus (gas) genome using a bacillus subtilis consensus identified a number of potential catabolite-responsive elements (cre) important for binding by the catabolite control protein a (ccpa), a mediator of ccr in gram-positive bacteria. intriguingly, a putative cre was identified in the promoter region of mga upstream of its distal p1 start of transcription. electrophoretic mobility shift  assays showed that a his-ccpa fusion protein was capable of binding specifically  to the cre in pmga in vitro. deletion analysis of pmga using single-copy pmga-gusa reporter strains found that pmga p1 and its upstream cre were not required for normal autoregulated mga expression from pmga p2 as long as mga was  produced from its native locus. in fact, the pmga p1 region appeared to show a negative influence on pmga p2 in these studies. however, deletion of the cre at the native pmga resulted in a reduction of total mga transcripts as determined by real-time reverse transcription-pcr, supporting a role for ccpa in initial expression. furthermore, normal transcriptional initiation from the pmga p1 start site alone was dependent on the presence of the cre. importantly, inactivation of ccpa in the m6 gas strain jrs4 resulted in a reduction in pmga expression and mga protein levels in late-logarithmic-phase cell growth. these data support a role for ccpa in the early activation of the mga promoter and establish a link between ccr and mga regulation in the gas.

TI  == qsar studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii.
AB  == fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. fabh, beta-ketoacyl-acp  synthase iii, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. quantitative structure-activity relationship (qsar) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of fabh and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli, which demonstrate fabh inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. the qsar studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of oh group (on x position of the nucleus). on the other side presence of hetero-atoms like n, o, or s at r(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. the comparison of qsar between the fabh inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, n. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of oh group (on x  position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.

TI  == deoxyribonucleoside kinases activate nucleoside antibiotics in severely pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == common bacterial pathogens are becoming progressively more resistant to traditional antibiotics, representing a major public-health crisis. therefore, there is a need for a variety of antibiotics with alternative modes of action. in our study, several nucleoside analogs were tested against pathogenic staphylococci and streptococci. we show that pyrimidine-based nucleoside analogs, like 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (azt) and 2',2'-difluoro-2'deoxycytidine (gemcitabine), are specifically activated by the endogenous bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases, leading to cell death. deoxyribonucleoside kinase-deficient escherichia coli strains become highly susceptible to nucleoside analogs when they express recombinant kinases from staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. we further demonstrate that recombinant s. aureus deoxyadenosine kinase efficiently phosphorylates the anticancer drug gemcitabine  in vitro and is therefore the key enzyme in the activation pathway. when adult mice were infected intraperitoneally with a fatal dose of s. pyogenes strain ap1  and afterwards received gemcitabine, they failed to develop a systemic infection. nucleoside analogs may therefore represent a promising alternative for combating  pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == molecular and structural characterization of the pezat chromosomal toxin-antitoxin system of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the chromosomal pezt gene of the gram-positive pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae  encodes a protein that is homologous to the zeta toxin of the streptococcus pyogenes plasmid psm19035-encoded epsilon-zeta toxin-antitoxin system. overexpression of pezt in escherichia coli led to severe growth inhibition from which the bacteria recovered approximately 3 h after induction of expression. the toxicity of pezt was counteracted by peza, which is encoded immediately upstream  of pezt and shares weak sequence similarities in the c-terminal region with the epsilon antitoxin. the pezat genes form a bicistronic operon that is co-transcribed from a sigma(70)-like promoter upstream of peza and is negatively  autoregulated with peza functioning as a transcriptional repressor and pezt as a  co-repressor. both peza and the non-toxic peza(2)pezt(2) protein complex bind to  a palindrome sequence that overlaps the promoter. this differs from the epsilon-zeta system in which epsilon functions solely as the antitoxin and transcriptional regulation is carried out by another protein designated omega. results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that the toxicity of pezt is dependent on a highly conserved phosphoryltransferase active site and  an atp/gtp nucleotide binding site. in the peza(2)pezt(2) complex, peza neutralizes the toxicity of pezt by blocking the nucleotide binding site through  steric hindrance.

TI  == modification of chicken avian beta-defensin-8 at positively selected amino acid sites enhances specific antimicrobial activity.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps), essential components of innate immunity, are found in a range of phylogenetically diverse species and are thought to act by disrupting the membrane integrity of microbes. in this paper, we used evolutionary signatures to identify sites that are most relevant during the functional evolution of these molecules and introduced amino acid substitutions to improve activity. we first demonstrate that the anti-microbial activity of chicken avian beta-defensin-8, previously known as gallinacin-12, can be significantly increased against escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella typhimurium phop- mutant and streptococcus pyogenes through targeted amino acid substitutions, which confer increased peptide charge. however, by increasing the amp charge through amino acid substitutions at sites predicted to be subject to positive selection, antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli was further increased. in contrast, no further increase in activity was observed against the remaining pathogens. this result suggests that charge-increasing modifications confer increased broad-spectrum activity to an amp, whilst positive selection at particular sites is involved in directing the antimicrobial response against specific pathogens. thus, there is potential for the rational design of novel therapeutics based on specifically targeted and modified amps.

(2 cases) were the most commonly isolated bacteria from the lung in the cases of pneumonia. fungal organisms, consistent with aspergillus sp. were present histologically within the pulmonary lesions in 5 cases. bacterial agents associated with enterocolitis included clostridium perfringens (2 cases), e. coli (1 case), salmonella newport  (1 case) and salmonella thompson (1 case). the majority (56.3%) of the death loss in elk of known ages occurred in animals 1 year of age or less, with 71.4% of the gastrointestinal parasitism, 60.0% of the malnutrition, 60.0% of the enterocolitis, and 57.1% of the pneumonia cases occurring in animals within this  age range. in conclusion, gastrointestinal parasitism, pneumonia, malnutrition, enterocolitis and rumenitis/acidosis were considered the most common causes of death in captive elk in this study.

TI  == targeted drug-carrying bacteriophages as antibacterial nanomedicines.
AB  == while the resistance of bacteria to traditional antibiotics is a major public health concern, the use of extremely potent antibacterial agents is limited by their lack of selectivity. as in cancer therapy, antibacterial targeted therapy could provide an opportunity to reintroduce toxic substances to the antibacterial arsenal. a desirable targeted antibacterial agent should combine binding specificity, a large drug payload per binding event, and a programmed drug release mechanism. recently, we presented a novel application of filamentous bacteriophages as targeted drug carriers that could partially inhibit the growth  of staphylococcus aureus bacteria. this partial success was due to limitations of drug-loading capacity that resulted from the hydrophobicity of the drug. here we  present a novel drug conjugation chemistry which is based on connecting hydrophobic drugs to the phage via aminoglycoside antibiotics that serve as solubility-enhancing branched linkers. this new formulation allowed a significantly larger drug-carrying capacity of the phages, resulting in a drastic improvement in their performance as targeted drug-carrying nanoparticles. as an example for a potential systemic use for potent agents that are limited for topical use, we present antibody-targeted phage nanoparticles that carry a large  payload of the hemolytic antibiotic chloramphenicol connected through the aminoglycoside neomycin. we demonstrate complete growth inhibition toward the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and escherichia coli with an improvement in potency by a factor of approximately 20,000 compared to the free drug.

TI  == tbk1 protects vacuolar integrity during intracellular bacterial infection.
AB  == tank-binding kinase-1 (tbk1) is an integral component of type i interferon induction by microbial infection. the importance of tbk1 and type i interferon in antiviral immunity is well established, but the function of tbk1 in bacterial infection is unclear. upon infection of murine embryonic fibroblasts with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (salmonella), more extensive bacterial proliferation was observed in tbk1(-/-) than tbk1(+/+) cells. tbk1 kinase activity was required for restriction of bacterial infection, but interferon regulatory factor-3 or type i interferon did not contribute to this tbk1-dependent function. in tbk1(-/-)cells, salmonella, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and streptococcus pyogenes escaped from vacuoles into the cytosol where increased replication occurred, which suggests that tbk1 regulates  the integrity of pathogen-containing vacuoles. knockdown of tbk1 in macrophages and epithelial cells also resulted in increased bacterial localization in the cytosol, indicating that the role of tbk1 in maintaining vacuolar integrity is relevant in different cell types. taken together, these data demonstrate a requirement for tbk1 in control of bacterial infection distinct from its established role in antiviral immunity.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the in-vitro antimicrobial properties of a commercialized  preparation (angocin anti-infekt n) containing a combination of the haulm of nasturtium (tropaeoli majoris herba; n) and of the roots of horseradish (armoraciae rusticanae radix; h). this preparation can be used to treat upper respiratory tract (urti) and urinary tract infections (uti). the active ingredients are volatile mustard oils, which are activated in the gastrointestinal tract after oral intake. previous research has shown mustard oils derived from either n or h to possess antibacterial activity. methods: in order to assess the antimicrobial capacity of phytotherapeutic compounds containing volatile mustard oils, a modified gas-test was used. native preparations of n and h were applied to the lids of columbia agar plates (ratio n:h = 2.5:1) and mixed with sterile h20. thirteen different bacterial species including haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa, mrsa) were tested (20 isolates each). the  test organisms were plated onto the blood agar plates and placed above the native preparations. the plates were sealed with adhesive tape and incubated at 37 degrees c. following incubation of 24 h and 92 h, colony forming units (cfu) were counted and the minimal inhibitory concentrationg (mic90) was determined for each bacterial species. results: relevant antimicrobial activities of the combined native preparations were found against h. influenzae (mic90 50 mg n / 20 mg h), m. catarrhalis (100 mg n / 40 mg h), e. coli (400 mg n / 160 mg h), p aeruginosa  (400 mg n / 160 mg h), mssa (400 mg n 1 160 mg h), mrsa (400 mg n / 160 mg h), and s. pyogenes (400 mg n / 160 mg h). conclusion: antimicrobial testing of a combination of n and h revealed broad antibacterial activities against clinically relevant pathogens covering both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, thus  confirming previous reports of the antibacterial properties of mustard oils. additionally, this study demonstrated that the combination of n and h leads to synergistic activity in terms of improved pseudomonas-susceptibility compared to  the previous reported activities of the single compounds. thus, these results prove that there is a rational basis for treatment of urti and uti with a combination of n and h.

TI  == male of group a streptococcus participates in the rapid transport of maltotriose  and longer maltodextrins.
AB  == study of the maltose/maltodextrin binding protein male in escherichia coli has resulted in fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms of microbial transport. whether gram-positive bacteria employ a similar pathway for maltodextrin transport is unclear. the maltodextrin binding protein male has previously been shown to be key to the ability of group a streptococcus (gas) to  colonize the oropharynx, the major site of gas infection in humans. here we used  a multifaceted approach to elucidate the function and binding characteristics of  gas male. we found that gas male is a central part of a highly efficient maltodextrin transport system capable of transporting linear maltodextrins that are up to at least seven glucose molecules long. of the carbohydrates tested, gas male had the highest affinity for maltotriose, a major breakdown product of starch in the human oropharynx. the thermodynamics and fluorescence changes induced by gas male-maltodextrin binding were essentially opposite those reported for e. coli male. moreover, unlike e. coli male, gas male exhibited no specific binding of maltose or cyclic maltodextrins. our data show that gas developed a transport system optimized for linear maltodextrins longer than two glucose molecules that has several key differences from its well-studied e. coli counterpart.

TI  == proteomic analysis and identification of streptococcus pyogenes surface-associated proteins.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a gram-positive human pathogen that causes a wide spectrum of disease, placing a significant burden on public health. bacterial surface-associated proteins play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions and  pathogenesis and are important targets for the immune system. the identification  of these proteins for vaccine development is an important goal of bacterial proteomics. here we describe a method of proteolytic digestion of surface-exposed proteins to identify surface antigens of s. pyogenes. peptides generated by trypsin digestion were analyzed by multidimensional tandem mass spectrometry. this approach allowed the identification of 79 proteins on the bacterial surface, including 14 proteins containing cell wall-anchoring motifs, 12 lipoproteins, 9 secreted proteins, 22 membrane-associated proteins, 1 bacteriophage-associated protein, and 21 proteins commonly identified as cytoplasmic. thirty-three of these proteins have not been previously identified as cell surface associated in  s. pyogenes. several proteins were expressed in escherichia coli, and the purified proteins were used to generate specific mouse antisera for use in a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the immunoreactivity of specific antisera to some of these antigens confirmed their surface localization. the data reported here will provide guidance in the development of a novel vaccine to prevent infections caused by s. pyogenes.

TI  == characterization of the arginine deiminase of streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus.
AB  == streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus is an important cause of infectious diseases in horses and rarely humans. little is known about the virulence factors or protective antigens of s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. in the present study, i designed original primers based on an alignment of the gene sagp(arca) from streptococcus pyogenes encoding streptococcal acid glycoprotein-arginine deiminase (sagp/ad) to amplify the s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus counterpart sequence by polymerase chain reaction, and i analyzed the sagp(arca) gene of the  organism. using chromosomal walking steps, i identified a contiguous eight-gene locus involved in sagp/ad production. their open reading frames were found to share significant homologies and to correspond closely in molecular mass to previously sequenced arc genes of s. pyogenes, thus they were designated ahrc.2 (arginine repressor), arcr (crp/fnr transcription regulator), sagp(arca) (streptococcal acid glycoprotein-arginine deiminase), putative acetyltransferase  gene, arcb (ornithine carbamyl transferase), arcd (arginine-ornithine antiporter), arct (xaa-his peptidase), and arcc (carbamate kinase). the sagp homologue of s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (szsagp), encoded by arca gene of the bacteria (arca(sz)), was successfully expressed in escherichia coli and purified  to homogeneity. when in vitro growth inhibitory activity of the recombinant szsagp was tested against molt-3 cells, it inhibited the growth of the cells during the 3 days of culture in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by the induction of apoptotic cell death. the recombinant protein also possessed ad activity. by immunoblot analysis using both anti-szsagp-sfbi(h8) and anti-sfbi(h8) sera, i was able to demonstrate that the szsagp protein is expressed on the streptococcal surface.

TI  == the functional molecular mass of the pasteurella hyaluronan synthase is a monomer.
AB  == hyaluronan (ha), a linear polysaccharide composed of beta1,3-glcnac-beta1,4-glcua repeats, is found in the extracellular matrix of vertebrate tissues as well as the capsule of several pathogenic bacteria. all known ha synthases (hass) are dual-action glycosyltransferases that catalyze the addition of two different sugars from udp-linked precursors to the growing ha chain. the bacterial hyaluronan synthase, pmhas from gram-negative pasteurella multocida, is a 972-residue membrane-associated protein. previously, the gram-positive streptococcus pyogenes enzyme, sphas (419 residues), and the vertebrate enzyme, xlhas1 (588 residues), were found to function as monomers of protein, but the pmhas is not similar at the protein sequence level and has quite different enzymological properties. we have utilized radiation inactivation to measure the  target size of recombinant full-length and truncated pmhas. the target size of has activity was confirmed using internal enzyme standards of known molecular weight. we found that the pasteurella ha synthase protein functions catalytically as a monomer. functional truncated soluble pmhas also behaves as a polypeptide monomer as assessed by gel filtration chromatography and light scattering.

TI  == metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  == the synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [co (ii), cu (ii), ni (ii) and zn (ii)] is described. the nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. in all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-o and endocyclic-n of the beta-lactam ring. the new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (a), klebsiella pneumonae (b), proteus mirabilis (c), pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), salmonella typhi (e), shigella dysentriae (f), bacillus cereus (g), corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), staphylococcus aureus (j) and streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. all compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.

TI  == etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of poland.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of poland in years 2003-2005. bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from california mastitis test (cmt) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of api tests (analytical profile index). it was found that 32.7% of samples that were cmt positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) (14.6%), staph. aureus (8.6%), gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among gram-negative bacilli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), serratia marcescens (3.1%), pasteurella multocida (3.1%), acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria  species. stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), staph. hyicus (12.2%), staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), staph. sciuri (11.6%), staph. chromogenes (8.8%), staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent cns. streptococcus uberis (50%), str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), str. acidominimus (6.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among camp-negative streptococci. an increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, staph. aureus, a. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.

TI  == the rgg regulator of streptococcus pyogenes influences utilization of nonglucose  carbohydrates, prophage induction, and expression of the nad-glycohydrolase virulence operon.
AB  == the expression of many virulence-associated genes in streptococcus pyogenes is controlled in a growth phase-dependent manner. unlike the model organisms escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, such regulation is apparently not dependent upon alternative sigma factors but appears to rely on complex interactions among several transcriptional regulators, including rgg. the purpose of this study was to identify changes in gene expression associated with inactivation of the rgg gene in s. pyogenes strain nz131 (serotype m49). to this  end, the transcriptomes of wild-type and rgg mutant strains were analyzed during  both the exponential and postexponential phases of growth using affymetrix nimbleexpress gene chips. genomewide differences in transcript levels were identified in both phases of growth. inactivation of rgg disrupted coordinate expression of genes associated with the metabolism of nonglucose carbon sources,  such as fructose, mannose, and sucrose. the changes were associated with an inability of the mutant strain to grow using these compounds as the primary carbon source. bacteriophage transcript levels were also altered in the mutant strain and were associated with decreased induction of at least one prophage. finally, transcripts encoding virulence factors involved in cytolysin-mediated translocation of nad-glycohydrolase, including the immunity factor ifs and the cytolysin (streptolysin o [slo]), were more abundant in the mutant strain, which  correlated with the amount of nadase and slo activities in culture supernatant fluids. the results provide further evidence that rgg contributes to growth phase-dependent gene regulation in strain nz131.

TI  == antibacterial properties of emla and lidocaine in wound tissue biopsies for culturing.
AB  == if a tissue biopsy from a chronic wound is sampled for culture, the antibacterial properties of local anesthetics may pose a problem in producing false-negative results. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of emla (astrazeneca) and lidocaine on common wound pathogenic bacteria. an in vitro study of a total of 25 clinical isolates and atcc reference strains of staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes was conducted. the isolates were exposed to the local anesthetic drugs (and some of their contents separately) at 35 degrees c over a 24-hour period and time-kill curves were recorded. no culture media were used and saline was used for controls. emla was found to have a rapid acting and powerful antibacterial effect and should not be  used before culturing tissue samples. lidocaine 1% was found not to inhibit the bacterial strains when exposure time was held below 2 hours. we conclude that culturing tissue from a wound biopsy is safe within 2 hours when a pure, preservative-free lidocaine 1% solution is used.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract.

TI  == visible-light-induced bactericidal activity of a nitrogen-doped titanium photocatalyst against human pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (tio(2)) substrates is induced primarily by uv light irradiation. recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. their antibacterial activity, however, remains  to be quantified. in this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against escherichia coli compared to pure tio(2) and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates. we also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. in the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including shigella flexneri, listeria  monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates than by pure tio(2) substrates. these findings suggest that nitrogen-doped tio(2) has potential application in the development of alternative disinfectants for environmental and medical usages.

TI  == dna methylase activity as a marker for the presence of a family of phage-like elements conferring efflux-mediated macrolide resistance in streptococci.
AB  == recently, two related chimeric genetic elements (tn1207.3 and phi10394.4) were shown to carry the macrolide efflux gene mef in streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci [gas]). the dissemination of elements belonging to the tn1207.3/phi10394.4 family in recent isolates of gas, streptococcus dysgalactiae  subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus agalactiae recovered in portugal was surveyed. in total, 149 gas, 18 s. pneumoniae, 4 s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, and 5 s. agalactiae isolates from infections, presenting the m phenotype of macrolide resistance and containing the mef gene, were screened for the presence of tn1207.3/phi10394.4 by pcr targeting open reading frames (orfs) specific for these related elements. all the gas isolates tested and one of the s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates carried tn1207.3. however, neither of these elements was found in the isolates of the other streptococcal species. it was also noted that the dnas of the isolates carrying tn1207.3 were resistant to cleavage by the endonuclease smai. cloning and expression of orf12 of tn1207.3 in escherichia coli showed that it encoded a  methyltransferase that rendered dna refractory to cleavage by smai (m.spy10394i). using this characteristic as a marker for the presence of the tn1207.3/phi10394.4 family, we reviewed the literature and concluded that these genetic elements are  widely distributed among tetracycline-susceptible gas isolates presenting the m phenotype from diverse geographic origins and may have played an important role in the dissemination of macrolide resistance in this species.

TI  == how long do nosocomial pathogens persist on inanimate surfaces? a systematic review.
AB  == background: inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. the aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. methods: the literature was systematically reviewed in medline without language restrictions. in addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard  textbooks on the topic were reviewed. all reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were  included. results: most gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. (including vre), staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), or streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. many gram-negative species, such as acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, or shigella spp., can also survive for months. a few others, such as bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, proteus vulgaris, or vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. mycobacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. persistence of other yeasts, such as torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (candida parapsilosis, 14 days). most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, sars or rhino virus, can persist on  surfaces for a few days. viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, hav, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. blood-borne viruses, such as hbv or hiv, can persist for more than one week. herpes viruses, such as cmv or hsv type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from  only a few hours up to 7 days. conclusion: the most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.

AB  == the effect of topical application of phytoconstituents (fraction i, ii and iii) fractionated from a hydroalcohol extract of the bark of the plant, terminalia arjuna, was assessed on the healing of rat dermal wounds using in vivo models. the results indicated a statistically significant increase in the tensile strength of the incision wounds and the percent epithelialization of excision wounds compared with control (p < 0.05). however, topical treatment with fraction i, consisting mainly of tannins, was found to demonstrate a maximum increase in the tensile strength of incision wounds. even with respect to excision wounds, the fastest rate of epithelialization was seen with fraction i. hexosamine estimation of granulation tissue obtained from excision wounds revealed an increase in the hexosamine content with fraction i compared with the control. in  addition, fraction i from the hydroalcohol extract of arjuna bark possessed antimicrobial activity against tested microorganisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes but not candida albicans. these results strongly document the beneficial effects of fraction i, consisting mainly of tannins, of terminalia arjuna in the acceleration of the healing process. thus, the present study validates the claim  made with respect to the plant as well as corroborating the astringent effect of  tannins by drawing the tissues closer together.

TI  == functional analysis of a group a streptococcal glycoside hydrolase spy1600 from family 84 reveals it is a beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase and not a hyaluronidase.
AB  == group a streptococcus (streptococcus pyogenes) is the causative agent of severe invasive infections such as necrotizing fasciitis (the so-called 'flesh eating disease') and toxic-shock syndrome. spy1600, a glycoside hydrolase from family 84 of the large superfamily of glycoside hydrolases, has been proposed to be a virulence factor. in the present study we show that spy1600 has no activity toward galactosaminides or hyaluronan, but does remove beta-o-linked n-acetylglucosamine from mammalian glycoproteins--an observation consistent with  the inclusion of eukaryotic o-glycoprotein 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-d-glucopyranosidases within glycoside hydrolase family 84. proton nmr studies, structure-reactivity studies for a series of fluorinated  analogues and analysis of 1,2-dideoxy-2'-methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-delta2'-thiazoline as a competitive inhibitor reveals that spy1600 uses a double-displacement mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis. family 84 glycoside hydrolases are therefore comprised of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic beta-n-acetylglucosaminidases using a conserved catalytic mechanism involving substrate-assisted catalysis. since these enzymes do not have detectable hyaluronidase activity, many family 84 glycoside hydrolases are most likely incorrectly annotated as hyaluronidases.

TI  == coenzyme q10 production in recombinant escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  == in the present work, escherichia coli dh5alpha was metabolically engineered for coq(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsa) from agrobacterium tumefaciens. grown in 2ytg medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% nacl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial ph of 7, the recombinant e. coli was capable of coq(10) production up to 470 microg/gdcw (dry  cell weight). this value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gdcw simply by increasing the initial culture ph from 7 to 9. supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. however, engineering of a  lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the coq(10) production. lower mevalonate semi-pathways of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. among these, the pathway of streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding coq(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gdcw when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mm. in order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. in a recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as ddsa enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-coa to ipp, resulting in coq(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gdcw, without mevalonate supplementation. in contrast, a whole  mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. however, it provided coq(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gdcw, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsa alone.

TI  == dysgalacticin: a novel, plasmid-encoded antimicrobial protein (bacteriocin) produced by streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis.
AB  == dysgalacticin is a novel bacteriocin produced by streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strain w2580 that has a narrow spectrum of antimicrobial activity directed primarily against the principal human streptococcal pathogen streptococcus pyogenes. unlike many previously described bacteriocins of gram-positive bacteria, dysgalacticin is a heat-labile 21.5 kda anionic protein that kills its target without inducing lysis. the n-terminal amino acid sequence  of dysgalacticin [asn-glu-thr-asn-asn-phe-ala-glu-thr-gln-lys-glu-ile-thr-thr-asn-(asn)-glu-ala] has no known homologue in publicly available sequence databases. the dysgalacticin structural gene, dysa, is located on the indigenous plasmid pw2580  of strain w2580 and encodes a 220 aa preprotein which is probably exported via a  sec-dependent transport system. natural dysa variants containing conservative amino acid substitutions were also detected by sequence analyses of dysa elements from s. dysgalactiae strains displaying w2580-like inhibitory profiles. production of recombinant dysgalacticin by escherichia coli confirmed that this protein is solely responsible for the inhibitory activity exhibited by strain w2580. a combination of in silico secondary structure prediction and reductive alkylation was employed to demonstrate that dysgalacticin has a novel structure containing a disulphide bond essential for its biological activity. moreover, dysgalacticin displays similarity in predicted secondary structure (but not primary amino acid sequence or inhibitory spectrum) with another plasmid-encoded  streptococcal bacteriocin, streptococcin a-m57 from s. pyogenes, indicating that  dysgalacticin represents a prototype of a new class of antimicrobial proteins.

TI  == construction of transposition insertion libraries and specific gene inactivation  in the pathogen lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == this paper reports the development of genetic tools in lactococcus garvieae, an important gram-positive bacterial pathogen affecting both fish and mammals. the vector pgkv210, a broad host range vector, was introduced by electroporation into l. garvieae uniud074. the maximal frequency obtained was 3.2 x 10(5) transformants/mug of dna. moreover, this effect is highly reproducible and appears to be constant, since all l. garvieae strains tested were transformed. once the optimal transformation procedure was established, it was used to generate isogenic and transposition mutants. insertional mutagenesis of the l. garvieae sa9h10l gene, similar to a streptococcus pyogenes gene encoding the m protein (emm64), was carried out using the conditional replication plasmid pori19. transposition mutagenesis using the streptococcal temperature-sensitive suicide vector ptv408 to deliver tn917 into the chromosome of l. garvieae was also achieved at a frequency of ca. 10(-4). transposon flanking dna sequences were obtained by plasmid rescue in escherichia coli and their sequencing analysis demonstrated that the transposon was inserted at different chromosomal loci. tn917 also made it possible to select a mutant in the operon involved in mannitol fermentation in this microorganism. the results obtained in the present study lay the foundation for future research on the virulence mechanisms of l. garvieae.

AB  == objective: it has been postulated that geographical locations of the herbs affect the constituents of their essential oils and thus the degree of their antimicrobial action. this study examine two samples of clove obtained from sri lanka and zanzibar and two samples of thyme from iran and oman to determine the antimicrobial potential of their extracted oils. method: the active agents in each plant were extracted by steam distillation and by boiling. the antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined at neat and by two-fold dilutions in well agar diffusion technique using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium species, salmonella species, bacteroides fragilis and candida albicans. results: all oil extracts possessed antimicrobial activity against all bacteria and yeast tested.  their water extracts exhibited lower antimicrobial activity, though thyme aqueous extract was active only against s. aureus. the lowest concentration of antimicrobial activity (0.1% i.e., 1:1024) was obtained with thyme oil extract using candida albicans. there was no significant difference in antimicrobial activity between clove obtained from sri lanka or zanzibar or thyme obtained from iran or oman. conclusion: our experiment showed that the country of origin of the herbs has no effect on their antimicrobial activity. however, further work is necessary to ascertain why candida albicans displayed remarkable degree of sensitivity with the extracts than all the other organisms test.

TI  == dna microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  == a dna microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. a database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available dna sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with dna templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, and bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected dna templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(sa) in b. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == the mechanism of direct heme transfer from the streptococcal cell surface protein shp to htsa of the htsabc transporter.
AB  == the heme-binding proteins shp and htsa are part of the heme acquisition machinery found in streptococcus pyogenes. the hexacoordinate heme (fe(ii)-protoporphyrin ix) or hemochrome form of holoshp (hemoshp) is stable in air in tris-hcl buffer,  ph 8.0, binds to apohtsa with a k(d) of 120 +/- 18 microm, and transfers its heme to apohtsa with a rate constant of 28 +/- 6s(-1) at 25 degrees c, ph 8.0. the hemohtsa product then autoxidizes to the hexacoordinate hemin (fe(iii)-protoporphyrin ix) or hemichrome form (hemihtsa) with an apparent rate constant of 0.017 +/- 0.002 s(-1). hemishp also rapidly transfers hemin to apohtsa through a hemishp.apohtsa complex (k(d) = 48 +/- 7 microm) at a rate approximately 40,000 times greater than the rate of simple hemin dissociation from hemishp into solvent (k(transfer) = 43 +/- 3s(-1) versus k(-hemin) = 0.0003  +/- 0.00006 s(-1)). the rate constants for hemin binding to and dissociation from htsa (k'(hemin) approximately 80 microm(-1) s(-1), k(-hemin) = 0.0026 +/- 0.0002  s(-1)) are 50- and 10-fold greater than the corresponding rate constants for shp  (k(hemin) approximately 1.6 microm(-1) s(-1), k(-hemin) = 0.0003 s(-1)), which implies that htsa has a more accessible active site. however, the affinity of apohtsa for hemin (k(hemin) approximately 31,000 microm(-1)) is roughly 5-fold greater than that of aposhp (k(hemin) approximately 5,300 microm(-1)), accounting for the net transfer from shp to hsta. these results support a direct, rapid, and affinity-driven mechanism of heme and hemin transfer from the cell surface receptor shp to the atp-binding cassette transporter system.

TI  == [aetiology and antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent outpatient infections].
AB  == the diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. during the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. one point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of klebsiella pneumoniae were  producers of this type of b-lactamases. ninety-six point five percent of the 797  isolations of salmonella serotipo enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive  to amoxyline. the gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin b. twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == antibiotic consumption and generation of resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae:  the paradoxical impact of quinolones in a complex selective landscape.
AB  == the development of resistance to the different antibiotics by the majority of bacterial species of clinical importance seems unavoidable. however, not all drugs have the same efficiency to select for resistance. large differences in the qualitative and quantitative consumption of antibiotics among countries are known to exist and several authors have consistently reported the direct relationship between consumption and selection of resistance for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli and beta-lactams and macrolides use. in spain, extensive surveillance started in 1996, and the willow (sauce) project, to monitor and update resistance in respiratory pathogens and to couple those data with data concerning national antibiotic consumption (ims) from both a temporal and geographical approach. temporally, despite a continuous increase of 16% in quinolone consumption from 1997 to 2001, basically due to the arrival of respiratory quinolones, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, a continuous linear increase in the resistance rates to ciprofloxacin in s. pneumoniae was not observed. there also was an inverse correlation between provincial consumption of quinolones and resistance to ciprofloxacin. several hypotheses are proposed and discussed to explain these  apparent paradoxical observations, such as the replacement of ciprofloxacin by more potent antipneumococcal quinolones, the possibility of an antibiotic pressure threshold, the influence of other nonquinolone drugs on the expression of ciprofloxacin-resistance biological costs, and the influence of changes in temporal or spatial prevalence of particular clones.

TI  == protease-stable polycationic photosensitizer conjugates between polyethyleneimine and chlorin(e6) for broad-spectrum antimicrobial photoinactivation.
AB  == we previously showed that covalent conjugates between poly-l-lysine and chlorin(e6) were efficient photosensitizers (ps) of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the polycationic molecular constructs increased binding and penetration of the ps into impermeable gram-negative cells. we have now prepared a novel set of second-generation polycationic conjugates between chlorin(e6) and three molecular forms of polyethyleneimine (pei): a small linear, a small cross-linked, and a large cross-linked molecule. the conjugates were characterized by high-pressure liquid chromatography and tested for their ability to kill a panel of pathogenic microorganisms, the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, the gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the yeast candida albicans, after exposure to low levels of red light. the large cross-linked molecule efficiently killed all organisms, while the linear conjugate killed gram-positive bacteria and c. albicans. the small cross-linked conjugate was the least efficient antimicrobial  ps and its remarkably low activity could not be explained by reduced photochemical quantum yield or reduced cellular uptake. in contrast to polylysine conjugates, the pei conjugates were resistant to degradation by proteases such as trypsin that hydrolyze lysine-lysine peptide bonds, the advantage of protease stability combined with the ready availability of pei suggests these molecules may be superior to polylysine-ps conjugates for photodynamic therapy of localized infections.

TI  == changing epidemiology of outpatient bacteremia in 3- to 36-month-old children after the introduction of the heptavalent-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine.
AB  == background: the introduction of routine vaccination with heptavalent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine has changed the overall incidence of bacteremia in children  3 months-3 years old. objective: to describe the changing incidence and etiology  of bacteremia in previously healthy toddlers presenting to outpatient clinical settings. methods: retrospective case series of all blood cultures obtained between september 1998 and august 2003 in kaiser permanente northern california outpatient clinics and emergency departments from previously healthy children 3 months-3 years old. results: implementation of routine vaccination with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine resulted in an 84% reduction of streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia (1.3-0.2%) and a 67% reduction in overall bacteremia (1.6-0.7%) in the study population. the rate of blood culture isolation of contaminating organisms remained unchanged at 1.8%; therefore, by the end of the  study, >70% of organisms identified in blood cultures were contaminants. during the 5 study years, total blood cultures drawn decreased by 35% in outpatient pediatric clinics but remained unchanged in emergency departments. by 2003, one-third of all pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures were escherichia coli, one-third were non-vaccine serotype s. pneumoniae, the majority of the remaining one-third were staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., neisseria meningitidis and streptococcus pyogenes. in our population of children routinely  immunized with the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine, a white blood cell count >15,000 by itself is a poor predictor of bacteremia in the febrile toddler (sensitivity, 74.0%; specificity, 54.5%; positive predictive value, 1.5%; negative predictive value, 99.5%). conclusion: in the united states, routine vaccinations with haemophilus influenzae type b and s. pneumoniae vaccines have made bacteremia in the previously healthy toddler a rare event. as the incidence  of pneumococcal bacteremia has decreased, e. coli, salmonella spp. and staphylococcus aureus have increased in relative importance. the use of the white blood cell count alone to guide the empiric use of antibiotics is not indicated.  new guidelines are needed to approach the previously healthy febrile toddler in the outpatient setting.

TI  == d-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase: functional and structural relationships to members of the ribulose-phosphate binding (beta/alpha)8-barrel superfamily.
AB  == the "ribulose phosphate binding" superfamily defined by the structural classification of proteins (scop) database is considered the result of divergent  evolution from a common (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel ancestor. the superfamily includes d-ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase (rpe), orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ompdc), and 3-keto-l-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase (kgpdc), members of the ompdc suprafamily, as well as enzymes involved in histidine and tryptophan biosynthesis that utilize phosphorylated metabolites as substrates. we now report studies of the functional and structural relationships of rpe to the members of the superfamily. as suggested by the results of crystallographic studies of the rpes from rice [jelakovic, s., kopriva, s., suss, k. h., and schulz, g. e. (2003) j. mol. biol. 326, 127-35] and plasmodium falciparum [caruthers, j., bosch, j., bucker, f., van voorhis, w., myler, p., worthey, e., mehlin, c., boni, e., de titta, g., luft, j., kalyuzhniy, o., anderson, l., zucker, f., soltis, m., and hol, w. g. j. (2006) proteins 62, 338-42], the rpe from streptococcus pyogenes is activated by zn(2+) which binds with a stoichiometry of one ion per polypeptide. although wild type rpe has a high affinity for zn(2+) and inactive apoenzyme cannot be prepared, the affinity for zn(2+) is decreased by alanine substitutions for the two histidine residues that  coordinate the zn(2+) ion (h34a and h67a); these mutant proteins can be prepared  in an inactive, metal-free form and activated by exogenous zn(2+). the crystal structure of the rpe was solved at 1.8 a resolution in the presence of d-xylitol  5-phosphate, an inert analogue of the d-xylulose 5-phosphate substrate. this structure suggests that the 2,3-enediolate intermediate in the 1,1-proton transfer reaction is stabilized by bidentate coordination to the zn(2+) that also is liganded to his 34, asp 36, his 67, and asp 176; the carboxylate groups of the asp residues are positioned also to function as the acid/base catalysts. although the conformation of the bound analogue resembles those of ligands bound in the active sites of ompdc and kgpdc, the identities of the active site residues that  coordinate the essential zn(2+) and participate as acid/base catalysts are not conserved. we conclude that only the phosphate binding motif located at the ends  of the seventh and eighth beta-strands of the (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel is functionally conserved among rpe, ompdc, and kgpdc, consistent with the hypothesis that the members of the "ribulose phosphate binding" (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel "superfamily" as defined by scop have not evolved by evolutionary processes involving the intact (beta/alpha)(8)-barrel. instead, this "superfamily" may result from assembly from smaller modules, including the conserved phosphate binding motif associated with the c-terminal (beta/alpha)(2)-quarter barrel.

TI  == enhancement of streptolysin o activity and intrinsic cytotoxic effects of the group a streptococcal toxin, nad-glycohydrolase.
AB  == streptolysin o (slo) is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by the important human pathogen, group a streptococcus (streptococcus pyogenes or gas).  in addition to its cytolytic activity, slo mediates the translocation of gas nad-glycohydrolase (nadase) into human epithelial cells in vitro. production of both nadase and slo is associated with augmented host cell injury beyond that produced by slo alone, but the mechanism of enhanced cytotoxicity is not known. we have now shown that expression of nadase together with slo dramatically enhanced the lytic activity of gas culture supernatants for erythrocytes but had  no effect on slo-mediated poration of synthetic cholesterol-rich liposomes. this  result revealed a previously unknown contribution of nadase to the cytolytic activity associated with gas production of slo. purified recombinant slo bound nadase in vitro, supporting a specific, physical interaction of the two proteins. exposure of human keratinocytes to wild-type gas, but not to a nadase-deficient mutant strain, resulted in profound depletion of cellular nad+ and atp. furthermore, expression of recombinant gas nadase in yeast, in the absence of slo, induced growth arrest, depletion of nad+ and atp, and cell death. these findings have provided evidence that the augmentation of slo-mediated cytotoxicity by nadase is a consequence of depletion of host cell energy stores through the enzymatic action of nadase. together, the results have provided mechanistic insight into the cytotoxic effects of a unique bipartite bacterial toxin.

TI  == unusual structural features of the bacteriophage-associated hyaluronate lyase (hylp2).
AB  == hyaluronate lyases are a class of endoglycosaminidase enzymes, which are of considerable complexity and heterogeneity. their primary function is to degrade hyaluronan and certain other glycosaminoglycans and facilitate the spread of disease. among hyaluronate lyases, the bacteriophage-associated enzymes are unique as they have the lowest molecular mass, very low amino acid sequence homology with bacterial hyaluronate lyases, and exhibit absolute specificity for  one type of glycosaminoglycan, i.e. hyaluronan. despite such unique characteristics significant details on structural features of these lyases are not available. the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage 10403 contains a gene, hylp2, which encodes for hyaluronate lyase (hylp2) in this organism. hylp2 was cloned, overexpressed, and purified to homogeneity. the recombinant hylp2 exists  as a homotrimer of molecular mass about 110 kda, under physiological conditions.  limited proteolysis and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation studies demonstrated that the n-terminal region of the protein is flexible, whereas the c-terminal portion has a compact conformation. the enzyme shows sequential unfolding, with the n-terminal unfolding first followed by the simultaneous unfolding and dissociation of the stabilized trimeric c-terminal domain. we isolated a functionally active c-terminal fragment (ser(128)-lys(337)) of the protein that was stabilized in a trimeric configuration. comparative functional studies with full-length protein, n:c complex, and isolated c-terminal domain demonstrated that the active site of hylp2 is present in the c-terminal portion of the enzyme, and the n-terminal portion modulates the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of the c-terminal domain.

TI  == crystal structure of a dna polymerase sliding clamp from a gram-positive bacterium.
AB  == background: sliding dna clamps are processivity factors that are required for efficient dna replication. dna polymerases maintain proximity to nucleic acid templates by interacting with sliding clamps that encircle dna and thereby link the polymerase enzyme to the dna substrate. although the structures of sliding clamps from gram-negative bacteria (e. coli), eukaryotes, archaea, and t4-like bacteriophages are well-known, the structure of a sliding clamp from gram-positive bacteria has not been reported previously. results: we have determined the crystal structure of the dimeric beta subunit of the dna polymerase iii holoenzyme of streptococcus pyogenes. the sliding clamp from this  gram-positive organism forms a ring-shaped dimeric assembly that is similar in overall structure to that of the sliding clamps from gram-negative bacteria, bacteriophage t4, eukaryotes and archaea. the dimer has overall dimensions of approximately 90 a x approximately 70 a x approximately 25 a with a central chamber that is large enough to accommodate duplex dna. in comparison to the circular shape of other assemblies, the s. pyogenes clamp adopts a more elliptical structure. conclusion: the sequences of sliding clamps from s. pyogenes and e. coli are only 23% identical, making the generation of structural  models for the s. pyogenes clamp difficult in the absence of direct experimental  information. our structure of the s. pyogenes beta subunit completes the catalog  of clamp structures from all the major sequence grouping of sliding clamps. the more elliptical rather than circular structure of the s. pyogenes clamp implies that the topological nature of encircling dna, rather than a precise geometric shape, is the most conserved aspect for this family of proteins.

TI  == a novel endogenous inhibitor of the secreted streptococcal nad-glycohydrolase.
AB  == the streptococcus pyogenes nad-glycohydrolase (spn) is a toxic enzyme that is introduced into infected host cells by the cytolysin-mediated translocation pathway. however, how s. pyogenes protects itself from the self-toxicity of spn had been unknown. in this report, we describe immunity factor for spn (ifs), a novel endogenous inhibitor that is essential for spn expression. a small protein  of 161 amino acids, ifs is localized in the bacterial cytoplasmic compartment. ifs forms a stable complex with spn at a 1:1 molar ratio and inhibits spn's nad-glycohydrolase activity by acting as a competitive inhibitor of its beta-nad+ substrate. mutational studies revealed that the gene for ifs is essential for viability in those s. pyogenes strains that express an nad-glycohydrolase activity. however, numerous strains contain a truncated allele of ifs that is linked to an nad-glycohydrolase-deficient variant allele of spn. of practical concern, ifs allowed the normally toxic spn to be produced in the heterologous host escherichia coli to facilitate its purification. to our knowledge, ifs is the first molecularly characterized endogenous inhibitor of a bacterial beta-nad(+)-consuming toxin and may contribute protective functions in the streptococci to afford spn-mediated pathogenesis.

AB  == structural genomics (sg) initiatives are expanding the universe of protein fold space by rapidly determining structures of proteins that were intentionally selected on the basis of low sequence similarity to proteins of known structure.  often these proteins have no associated biochemical or cellular functions. the sg success has resulted in an accelerated deposition of novel structures. in some cases the structural bioinformatics analysis applied to these novel structures has provided specific functional assignment. however, this approach has also uncovered limitations in the functional analysis of uncharacterized proteins using traditional sequence and backbone structure methodologies. a novel method,  named pvsoar (pocket and void surface of amino acid residues), of comparing the protein surfaces of geometrically defined pockets and voids was developed. pvsoar was able to detect previously unrecognized and novel functional relationships between surface features of proteins. in this study, pvsoar is applied to several structural genomics proteins. we examined the surfaces of yecm, bioh, and rpib from escherichia coli as well as the cbs domains from inosine-5'-monosphate dehydrogenase from streptococcus pyogenes, conserved hypothetical protein ta549 from thermoplasm acidophilum, and cbs domain protein mt1622 from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum with the goal to infer information about their biochemical function.

TI  == the antimicrobial potential of honey from united arab emirates on some microbial  isolates.
AB  == background: the study investigated activity of honey towards pathogens when grown in media contained honey, or when honey was added to cultures after inoculation.  material/methods: 1--staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes), e.coli and candida albicans (c. albicans) were cultured into broth containing 10-100% (wt/v) honey concentrations. 2--honey was added to broth inoculated with isolates after inoculation. 3--optimum growth of isolates, therapeutic period of honey, and time after addition of honey that showed optimum effect was measured. results: the optimum growth of e. coli and c. albicans was 10 hrs and s. aureus was 12 hrs. honey (30-70%) prevents growth of all isolates.  honey (80%) inhibited growth of small (1 microl) and large size of inoculum (10 microl) of e. coli and s. aureus when added to their cultures during 24 hrs after inoculation. honey inhibited growth of c. albicans when added during 2 to 6 hrs after inoculation. honey delayed the appearance of microbial growth on the plates. reculturing of specimens collected from media that showed no growth after addition of honey yielded recovery growth for e.coli and c. albicans, and therapeutic period of honey for e.coli and s. aureus was 2-24 hrs and for c. albicans was 2-6 hrs. conclusions: honey prevents growth of the isolates and inhibits their growth when honey was added to growing culture. the therapeutic period of honey and recovery growth of inhibited isolates necessitates adjustment of honey doses according to type of isolate and grade of growth.

TI  == bullous erysipelas: clinical presentation, staphylococcal involvement and methicillin resistance.
AB  == background: erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the dermis and hypodermis, mostly of streptococcal origin. bullous erysipelas represents a severe form of the disease. objective: to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics and treatment of bullous erysipelas. methods: patients with a diagnosis of bullous erysipelas who were treated at the department of dermatology, university hospital of heraklion, crete, greece, between the years 1996 and 2001 were retrospectively studied. results: fourteen patients (11 women, 3 men) with bullous erysipelas were evaluated. the lesions were located on the legs and face in 9 and 4 patients, respectively. the median duration of disease before hospital admission was 4 days. eight patients had fever at presentation. local trauma and various lesions were common causes for pathogen entry. the initial empirical antibiotic treatment included intravenous beta-lactams and was  modified according to the sensitivities of the isolated strains. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 7 (50%), while s. warneri, streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli grew from the lesions of 3 other patients. six out of 7 s. aureus strains were methicillin resistant (mrsa) but susceptible to several other non-beta-lactam antibiotics such as quinolones, vancomycin, rifampicin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. conclusion: our findings suggest that s. aureus is frequently involved in and probably contributes in synergy with beta-hemolytic streptococci to the complicated course of bullous erysipelas. the frequency of mrsa isolation suggests that beta-lactam antibiotics may not be sufficient for the treatment of bullous erysipelas anymore, at least in areas with a high incidence of mrsa strains. the role of other classes of antibiotics providing adequate coverage for mrsa has to be evaluated in prospective clinical trials.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == structure of a group a streptococcal phage-encoded virulence factor reveals a catalytically active triple-stranded beta-helix.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) causes severe invasive infections  including scarlet fever, pharyngitis (streptococcal sore throat), skin infections, necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease), septicemia, erysipelas, cellulitis, acute rheumatic fever, and toxic shock. the conversion from nonpathogenic to toxigenic strains of s. pyogenes is frequently mediated by bacteriophage infection. one of the key bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors is a putative "hyaluronidase," hylp1, a phage tail-fiber protein responsible for  the digestion of the s. pyogenes hyaluronan capsule during phage infection. here  we demonstrate that hylp1 is a hyaluronate lyase. the 3d structure, at 1.8-angstroms resolution, reveals an unusual triple-stranded beta-helical structure and provides insight into the structural basis for phage tail assembly  and the role of phage tail proteins in virulence. unlike the triple-stranded beta-helix assemblies of the bacteriophage t4 injection machinery and the tailspike endosialidase of the escherichia coli k1 bacteriophage k1f, hylp1 possesses three copies of the active center on the triple-helical fiber itself without the need for an accessory catalytic domain. the triple-stranded beta-helix is not simply a structural scaffold, as previously envisaged; it is harnessed to provide a 200-angstroms-long substrate-binding groove for the optimal reduction in hyaluronan viscosity to aid phage penetration of the capsule.

AB  == twenty-one rejected kidneys from 2426 slaughtered dairy cows (0.87 per cent) had  gross signs of pyelonephritis that were confirmed by histopathology. in all the kidneys the findings were consistent with a chronic rather than an acute infection. one species of bacteria was cultured from 12 of the kidneys and two species of bacteria were cultured from six. the most commonly isolated bacteria were escherichia coli, from eight kidneys, arcanobacterium pyogenes, from seven kidneys and corynebacterium renale, from five kidneys. the other bacteria cultured were corynebacterium cystitidis, corynebacterium species, streptococcus  species group g and enterococcus faecalis. e. coli was cultured from all the kidneys from which two species were isolated; the accompanying bacteria were a. pyogenes in three kidneys, c. renale in two and c. cystitidis in one. no bacteria were cultured from two of the kidneys and no significant bacteria were cultured from another. the kidneys with pyelonephritis were slightly larger than a comparison group of 72 kidneys without nephritis.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

AB  == the data of 1692 susceptibility tests acquired from april 2003 through march 2004 in the mastitis laboratory of the institute for food quality and safety were summarized in order to help veterinarians confronted with acute mastitis in choosing the appropriate antibiotic. two thirds of the milk samples were infected with gram-positive cocci. one third of these were identified as streptococcus (s.) uberis, one fourth as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. all isolates (100%) of s.  uberis, s. dysgalactiae, s. agalactiae and arcanobacterium pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. concering s. aureus, nearly 100% of the isolates were susceptible to oxacillin, cephalothin, cefacetril, cefquinom and neomycin, but only 88% of the isolates were sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefoperazon. the gram-negative rods (escherichia (e.) coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas spp.) displayed an irregular resistance pattern. more than 93% of all examined isolates including pseudomonas spp. were susceptible to colistin. the sensitivity of e. coli and klebsiella spp.to marbofloxacin, enrofloxacin and  cefquinom exceeded 96%. thus, the susceptibility of gram-positive mastitis pathogens to common antibiotics is favourable. because the highly effective colistin is no longer approved for local therapy, the situation for gram-negative bacteria is more difficult.

AB  == objective: to determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. design: laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. setting: a four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in turkey. results: overall 621 pathogens were identified from january 1999 to january 2004. of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as candida albicans. the most common organism was staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by escherichia coli (8%), streptococcus pyogenes (7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), enterococcus faecalis (4%), enterobacter spp. (4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), acinetobacter spp. (3%), proteus spp. (3%), group b. b-haemolytic streptococci (2%), candida albicans (2%), and citrobacter spp. (1%). the rate of  resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in s. aureus  were 31% and 12%, respectively. there was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. the rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production  in k. pneumoniae and e. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. conclusion: methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. we concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for mrsa. the surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for  these infections.

TI  == cloning, characterization and expression of escapin, a broadly antimicrobial fad-containing l-amino acid oxidase from ink of the sea hare aplysia californica.
AB  == a 60 kda monomeric protein isolated from the defensive purple ink secretion of the sea hare aplysia californica was cloned and sequenced, and is the first sea hare antimicrobial protein to be functionally expressed in e. coli. sequence analysis suggested that this protein is a flavin-containing l-amino acid oxidase  (laao), with one predicted potential glycosylation site, although the glycosylation could not be experimentally confirmed. this protein, which we call  ;escapin', has high sequence similarity to several other gastropod proteins. escapin was verified by nmr, mass spectroscopy and hplc to have fad as its flavin cofactor. escapin's antimicrobial effects, bacteriostasis and bactericidal, were  determined using a combination of two assays: (1) incubation of bacteria on solid media followed by assessment of inhibition by direct observation of zones of inhibition or by turbidity measurements; and (2) incubation of bacteria in liquid media followed by counting viable colonies after growing on agar plates. native escapin inhibited the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including marine bacteria (vibrio harveyii and staphylococcus aureus) and pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa). escapin also inhibited the growth of yeast and fungi, with different efficacies. escapin's antimicrobial activity was concentration dependent and did not decrease when stored for more than 5 months at room temperature. escapin was bacteriostatic and not bactericidal in minimal media (e.g. salt media) with glucose, yeast extract, and a mixture of 20 amino acids each at 50 micromol l(-1), but was bactericidal in media enriched with tryptone peptone. escapin was also strongly bactericidal in media with l-lysine at concentrations as low as 3 mmol l(-1) and slightly bactericidal in 50 mmol l(-1)  l-arginine, but not in most other amino acids even at 50 mmol l(-1). escapin had  high oxidase activity (producing hydrogen peroxide) with either l-arginine or l-lysine as a substrate and little to no oxidase activity with other l-amino acids. hydrogen peroxide alone (without escapin or amino acids) was strongly bacteriostatic but poorly bactericidal, similar in this respect to l-arginine but different from l-lysine in the presence of escapin. together these results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms to escapin's antimicrobial effects, with bacteriostasis resulting largely or entirely from the effects of hydrogen peroxide produced by escapin's laao activity, but bactericidal effects resulting  from lysine-dependent mechanisms not directly involving hydrogen peroxide. recombinant escapin expressed in bacteria was also active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, suggesting that glycosylation is not essential for antimicrobial activity.

AB  == objective: yale-new haven hospital (y-nhh) has maintained the longest running, single-center longitudinal database of neonatal sepsis, started in 1928. the objective of this study was to update this database with review of neonatal sepsis cases at y-nhh to identify longitudinal trends in demographics, pathogens, and outcome. methods: records of infants with positive blood cultures obtained while they were inpatients in the nicu at y-nhh from 1989 to 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. records of infants who were < or =30 days of age, had positive blood cultures, and were hospitalized at y-nhh outside the nicu from the same period were also reviewed, and all findings were compared with 60 years of preexisting data. results: a total of 862 organisms were identified in 755 episodes of sepsis from 647 infants. the percentage of cases of early-onset sepsis decreased and late-onset sepsis increased compared with the previous 10-year study period. a marked increase in cases as a result of commensal species was observed, particularly in preterm infants who had indwelling central vascular catheters, were receiving parenteral nutrition, and required prolonged mechanical ventilation. the overall percentage of sepsis caused by group b streptococcus and escherichia coli decreased. no episodes of sepsis from streptococcus pneumoniae or s pyogenes, common in the early years of the survey, were observed. the sepsis-related mortality rate steadily decreased, from 87% in 1928 to 3% in 2003. conclusions: the demographics, pathogens, and outcome associated with neonatal sepsis continue to change. the increase in late-onset sepsis in preterm infants who required prolonged intensive care indicates that strategies to prevent infection are urgently needed for this population of infants.

TI  == structure-function characterization and optimization of a plant-derived antibacterial peptide.
AB  == crushed seeds of the moringa oleifera tree have been used traditionally as natural flocculants to clarify drinking water. we previously showed that one of the seed peptides mediates both the sedimentation of suspended particles such as  bacterial cells and a direct bactericidal activity, raising the possibility that  the two activities might be related. in this study, the conformational modeling of the peptide was coupled to a functional analysis of synthetic derivatives. this indicated that partly overlapping structural determinants mediate the sedimentation and antibacterial activities. sedimentation requires a positively charged, glutamine-rich portion of the peptide that aggregates bacterial cells. the bactericidal activity was localized to a sequence prone to form a helix-loop-helix structural motif. amino acid substitution showed that the bactericidal activity requires hydrophobic proline residues within the protruding loop. vital dye staining indicated that treatment with peptides containing this motif results in bacterial membrane damage. assembly of multiple copies of this structural motif into a branched peptide enhanced antibacterial activity, since low concentrations effectively kill bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pyogenes without displaying a toxic effect on human red blood cells. this study thus identifies a synthetic peptide with potent antibacterial activity against specific human pathogens. it also suggests partly distinct molecular mechanisms for each activity. sedimentation may result from coupled flocculation and coagulation effects, while the bactericidal activity would require bacterial membrane destabilization by a hydrophobic loop.

TI  == effect of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on herd life in two new york state  dairy herds.
AB  == the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of clinical mastitis (cm) (both with and without specific pathogen identification) occurring in different stages of lactation on length of herd life in two new york state dairy farms. the 2,697 cows in the study were followed for one lactation (the first-occurring one  on or after 1 october 1999), until it ended because of a new lactation, culling,  or end of study (31 march 2001 in one farm; 31 july 2001 in the other). a cox proportional hazards model with time-dependent covariates, in sas((r)), was used  to measure, within a lactation, the effect of the first occurrence of cm (without specific pathogen identification) occurring 1--7, 8--66, 67--100, 101--225, or >or=226 days in milk (dim), on how long cows remained in the herd. for the first  occurrence of cm due to streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., and 'no pathogen isolated', the intervals were before and after the median dim of first occurrence of each pathogen. there were too few cases due to arcanobacterium pyogenes, and 'other pathogens grouped together' to split into intervals, so they were modeled as binary variables, i.e. as they occurred. cm was modeled using time-dependent covariates, to account for its differing effects throughout lactation on culling. other variables controlled for were herd, parity, calving season, and other significant diseases. in the dataset, the lactational incidence risk of the first occurrence of cm was 18.2%; 20.0% of the cows did not survive the lactation that  was studied. the overall annual culling percentage for both herds during the study period (including all cows, whether eligible for the study or not) was 35.6%. for cows with cm without pathogen identification, their highest hazard ratio (hr) of culling occurred from 67 to 100 dim. all of the pathogens modeled markedly reduced herd life. on average over the entire lactation, cows with staphylococcus spp. cm had the highest hrs for culling, although there were no significant differences among pathogens (at p=0.0018 (reflecting 28 pairwise comparisons)). for early-occurring (before median dim of first occurrence) s. aureus cm, the daily rate of change of the hr of culling increased over time. the hrs for culling were particularly high for late-occurring (after median dim of first occurrence) e. coli and klebsiella spp. cm early in the interval, but the daily rate of change of the hazard of culling for these two pathogens decreased sharply over time. treating cm as time-dependent therefore allowed us to measure  in greater detail, its varying effects (of when it occurred) on herd life.

AB  == aims: to compare growth and survival of selected bacteria implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (sids) on cot mattress polyurethane (pu) inner-foams and on different types of cot mattress cover materials. methods and results: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes were inoculated onto swatches of new-unused cot mattress pu inner-foam and onto three types of cot mattress covers (polyvinyl chloride, cotton and polyester). the influence of inoculation cell density, relative humidity (rh) and temperature of incubation on survival was assessed by recovery of cells in 0.85% nacl, with viable cell enumeration by plate counting on selective and differential media. utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources within cot mattress pu was assessed by following growth on aqueous leachate from pu, and by colorimetric determination of aromatic amines. good survival capability (>206 d) was shown by all three test species on  pu inner-foam and on polyester mattress cover at high rh (75%), but only by staph. aureus on pu at low rh (25%). aqueous soluble material from pu foam supports bacterial growth; removal of aromatic amines from aqueous leachate from  pu accompanies growth of staph. aureus. conclusions: staphylococcus aureus has good survival capability on cot mattress pu foam, even at low rh. soluble material within pu can serve as carbon and nitrogen sources for bacterial growth. significance and impact of the study: prolonged survival of staph. aureus on pu at low rh could explain, in the context of the common bacterial toxins hypothesis, an increased risk of sids associated with used infant mattresses.

AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. the trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (mics, < or =2 microg/ml for most  pathogens). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides  fragilis. a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. the susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. for most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. the excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of  tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bulgaria--a synopsis from bulstar 2003.
AB  == we introduce bulgarian surveillance tracking antimicrobial resistance (bulstar) and make the first report on surveillance data for 2003. this longitudinal surveillance programme monitors the isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinically significant microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, upper and lower respiratory tract, urine and wound samples in the participating microbiology laboratories. twenty eight public, 45 hospital  and 6 private laboratories from all 28 counties of the republic of bulgaria participated in bulstar 2003. the total number of isolates from monitored sources during the surveillance period was 98 929. seven microorganisms represented 72% of all isolated bacteria in bulstar 2003: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, proteus-providencia-morganella group, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes. generally the resistance of  clinically significant gram positive and gram negative bacteria in bulgaria was estimated to be at a medium level when compared with many other surveillance sources worldwide. a unique 32-year experiment on the population by treating all  severe infections with an ampicillin/gentamicin combination resulted in twofold higher levels of resistance to amynoglycosides compared with other countries worldwide. this is due to the extremely conservative treatment schemes used in the former socialist countries, based on national directives and cheap domestic production of gentamicin and ampicillin. the forthcoming introduction of a computer network and improvements in detecting mistakes are expected to increase  the sensitivity and the significance of bulstar surveillance system - an indispensable tool in the combat against increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance.

AB  == the overall composition upstream of start codons in escherichia coli was evaluated and viewed in connection with global transcriptome data. genes starting with aug as initiation codon tended to be expressed at higher levels than the non-aug genes, and the upstream region of the non-aug genes showed negligible signs of shine-dalgarno sequences. the latter is in sharp contrast to the aug genes. viewing these findings in connection with the current literature, it is proposed that a distinct mechanism for initiation of translation might exist for  non-aug genes that are not preceded by a shine-dalgarno sequence. a survey covering a range of other eubacteria (firmicutes, proteoacteria, and actinobacteria) reveals that it is mainly among the proteobacteria that non-aug genes do not display clear signs of shine-dalgarno regions.

TI  == gross abnormalities, bacteriology and histological lesions of uteri of dairy cows failing to conceive or maintain pregnancy.
AB  == aim: to describe the gross pathology, bacteriology and histopathology of the reproductive tracts of dairy cows that failed to conceive or maintain pregnancy.  methods: the reproductive tracts of 105 cows that were not pregnant at the end of the seasonal breeding programme were retrieved following slaughter. the tracts were examined grossly, both horns of the uterine lumen were swabbed for bacteriology, and tissue was collected from each horn and the body of the uterus  for histopathology. grossly enlarged uteri and tracts containing purulent vaginal content were excluded. histopathology was performed on three sections of uterine  tissue from each of three cows in which no gross pathological changes were detected and from which no bacteria were isolated, from three cows in which no gross pathology was detected but from which bacteria were isolated, and from three cows in which gross pathological changes were detected but from which no bacteria were isolated. results: thirty-six (34%) cows had one or more gross lesions which involved the ovary, uterine tube, uterus or vagina. bacteria were isolated from the uteri of 22 (21%) cows. isolates included arcanobacterium pyogenes (n = 1), escherichia coli (n = 1), fusobacterium spp (n = 1), haemophilus somnus (n = 5), streptococcus acidominimus (n = 12), s. bovis (n = 2), s. uberis (n = 1) and s. salivarious (n = 1). in only five cows were both gross pathology and bacteria detected. there was no relationship between the isolation of bacteria and the diagnosis of gross pathology of the uterus. there were no differences in the degree of histopathological changes in the uteri from  the three groups of cows examined, and lesions present were minor. conclusions: gross pathological changes and intra-uterine bacteria were found in 34% and 20% of cows, respectively, but the correlation between the two was poor. histopathological changes were unremarkable, suggesting the bacteriological findings were coincidental, that causative agents of infertility were not present at the time of examination, or that unrelated causes such as nutritional anoestrus may have been responsible for the failure of some cows to conceive.

AB  == a series of new antibacterial and antifungal schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) were synthesized, characterized and  screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and shigella dysentriae) and four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureous and streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifusus, candida albicans, aspergillus flavus, microsporum canis, fusarium solani, candida glaberata. the results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed schiffs' bases. the brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.

AB  == the susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (fqs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in japan during 2002. methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, the family of enterobactericeae, haemophilus influenzae and acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to fqs. the rate of fqs-resistant mrsa was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of fqs-resistant mssa. the fqs-resistance rate of mrcns was also higher than that of mscns, however, it was lower than that of mrsa. no fqs-resistant clinical isolates of salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. thirteen of escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of  proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl),  furthermore 6 of 13 in e. coli, 1 of 8 in k. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 esbl-producing isolates, and in p. mirabilis were fqs resistant. attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of esbl in relation to fqs resistance.  the rate of fqs-resistant p. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (uti) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (rti) were resistant. imp-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of p. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of s. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or s. aureus was not found.

TI  == human defensins.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. the eukaryotic  antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. the mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human  beta-defensin-3 (hbd-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (hbd-4) have been discovered.  similar to hbd-1 and hbd-2, hbd-3 has microbicidal activity towards the gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli) and the yeasts  candida albicans and malassezia furfur. in addition, hbd-3 kills gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus pyogenes or staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant s. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. in contrast to hbd-1 and hbd-2, significant expression of hbd-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. hbd-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. its bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.

TI  == the pro-sequence domain of streptopain directs the folding of the mature enzyme.
AB  == the cysteine endopeptidase streptopain, an extracellular enzyme from pathogenic streptococcus pyogenes, is synthesized as a precursor containing an nh2-terminal  pro-sequence. the pro-sequence of streptopain was expressed in escherichia coli and subjected to structural and functional investigation. heat-induced denaturation of the pro-sequence studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that it forms a compact structure and represents an independently folded domain. the isolated pro-sequence exhibits high affinity towards mature streptopain and associates with its cognate enzyme by forming an equimolar complex. refolding of denatured streptopain in the presence of pro-sequence in vitro facilitated recovery of active enzyme. expression of the mature streptopain in e. coli either alone, or in trans with its pro-sequence as an independent polypeptide, led to the formation of insoluble protein aggregates or functionally active enzyme, respectively. these results demonstrate that the pro-sequence domain acts as an intramolecular chaperone that directs the correct folding of the mature streptopain.

TI  == intervening sequences of regularly spaced prokaryotic repeats derive from foreign genetic elements.
AB  == prokaryotes contain short dn repeats known as crispr, recognizable by the regular spacing existing between the recurring units. they represent the most widely distributed family of repeats among prokaryotic genomes suggesting a biological function. the origin of the intervening sequences, at present unknown, could provide clues about their biological activities. here we show that crispr spacers derive from preexisting sequences, either chromosomal or within transmissible genetic elements such as bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids. remarkably, these extrachromosomal elements fail to infect the specific spacer-carrier strain, implying a relationship between crispr and immunity against targeted dna. bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids are involved in prokaryotic population control, evolution, and pathogenicity. all these biological traits could be influenced by the presence of specific spacers. crispr loci can be visualized as  mosaics of a repeated unit, separated by sequences at some time present elsewhere in the cell.

TI  == development of plex, a plasmid-based expression system for production of heterologous gene products by the gram-positive bacteria streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == while escherichia coli expression systems have been widely utilized for the production of heterologous proteins, these systems have limitations with regard to the production of particular protein products, including poor expression, expression of insoluble proteins into inclusion bodies, and/or expression of a truncated product. using the surface protein expression (spex) system, chromosomally integrated heterologous genes are expressed and secreted into media by the naturally competent gram-positive organism streptococcus gordonii. after e. coli turned out to be an inappropriate expression system to produce sufficient quantities of intact product, we successfully utilized spex to produce the heterologous antigen bh4xcrr that is designed from sequences homologous to the s. pyogenes m-protein c-repeat region. to further enhance production of this product by s. gordonii, we sought to develop a novel system for the production and secretion of heterologous proteins. we observed that under various growth conditions, s. gordonii secreted high levels of a 172 kda protein, which was identified by n-terminal sequence analysis as the glucosyltransferase gtf. here we report on the development of a plasmid-based expression system, designated as  plex, which we used to enhance production of bh4xcrr by s. gordonii. a region from the s. gordonii chromosome that contains the positive regulatory gene rgg, putative gtfg promoter, and gtfg secretion-signal sequence was cloned into the e. coli/streptococcus shuttle plasmid pva838. additionally, the bh4xcrr structural gene was cloned into the same plasmid downstream and in-frame with rgg and gtfg.  this plasmid construct was transformed into s. gordonii and bh4xcrr was detected  in culture supernatants from transformants at greater concentrations than in supernatants from a spex strain expressing the same product. bh4xcrr was easily purified from culture supernatant using a scalable two-step purification process  involving hydrophobic-interaction and gel-filtration chromatography.

TI  == chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  == objectives: although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely  clarified. using n-chlorotaurine (nct), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. it was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. methods: pathogens were incubated in nct, which was subsequently washed off. the oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. results: superficial chlorination in the form of covalent n-cl bonds to staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. for s. aureus, 3 min incubation with nct produced a cover of  3.3 x 10(-16) mol cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. the kind of microorganism, coating time, ph, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. the relative cover strength on  s. aureus by nct, chloramine t, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or n,n-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees c (>8 h at 1 degrees c), even  without a reduction of cfu. however, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal nh(2)cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. conclusions: the chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. furthermore, it may be a decisive  step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.

TI  == augmentation of the bactericidal activities of human cathelicidin cap18/ll-37-derived antimicrobial peptides by amino acid substitutions.
AB  == objective: mammalian myeloid and epithelial cells express various peptide antibiotics (such as defensins and cathelicidins) that contribute to the innate host defense against invading micro-organisms. among these, human cathelicidin cap18/ll-37 (l1-s37) possesses potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, to develop peptide derivatives with improved bactericidal actions, we utilized the amphipathic 18-mer peptide (k15-v32) of ll-37 as a template, and evaluated the activities of  modified peptides. methods: antibacterial activities of the peptides (0.022 approximately 4.4 microm corresponding to 0.1 approximately 10 microg/ml) were assessed by alamarblue assay using staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as target organisms. furthermore, the membrane-permeabilization activities of the peptides were examined by using e. coli ml-35p as a target. results: by substituting e16 and k25 with two l residues, the hydrophobicity of the peptide (18-mer ll) was increased, and by further substituting q22, d26 and n30 with three k residues, the cationicity of the peptide (18-mer llkkk) was enhanced. among peptide derivatives, 18-mer llkkk exhibited the most potent antibacterial actions against s. aureus (methicillin-resistant and -sensitive), s. pneumoniae,  s. pyogenes, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, and possessed the most powerful membrane-permeabilizing activities against e. coli ml-35p at the effective concentrations (p <0.05, 18-mer llkkk vs. 18-mer ll, 18-mer k15-v32 and ll-37). conclusions: bactericidal activities of the amphipathic human cap18/ll-37-derived 18-mer peptide can be augmented by modifying its hydrophobicity and cationicity,  and 18-mer llkkk is the most potent among peptide derivatives with therapeutic potential for gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.

TI  == hyaluronan biosynthesis by class i streptococcal hyaluronan synthases occurs at the reducing end.
AB  == previous studies reached different conclusions about whether class i hyaluronan synthases (hass) elongate hyaluronic acid (ha) by addition to the reducing or the nonreducing end. here we used two strategies to determine the direction of ha synthesis by purified class i hass from streptococcus equisimilis and streptococcus pyogenes. in the first strategy we used each of the two udp-sugar substrates separately to pulse label either the beginning or the end of ha chains. we then quantified the relative rates of radioactive ha degradation by treatment with beta-glycosidases that act at the nonreducing end. the results with both purified hass demonstrated that ha elongation occurred at the reducing  end. in the second strategy, we used purified s. equisimilis has, udp-glucuronic  acid, and udp[beta-32p]-glc-nac to radiolabel nascent ha chains. under conditions of limiting substrate, the 32p-labeled products were separated from the substrates by paper chromatography and identified as ha-[32p]udp saccharides based on their degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase or hyaluronidase and  by their binding to a specific ha-binding protein. the 32p radioactivity was chased (released) by incubation with unlabeled udp-sugars, showing that the ha-udp linkages turn over during ha biosynthesis. in contrast, ha-[32p]udp products made by the purified class ii pasteurella multocida has were not released by adding unlabeled udp-sugars, consistent with growth at the nonreducing end for this enzyme. the results demonstrate that the streptococcal class i has enzymes polymerize ha chains at the reducing end.

TI  == conserved interactions in the staphylococcus aureus dna polc chromosome replication machine.
AB  == the polc holoenzyme replicase of the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus pathogen has been reconstituted from pure subunits. we compared individual s. aureus replicase subunits with subunits from the gram-negative escherichia coli polymerase iii holoenzyme for activity and interchangeability. the central organizing subunit, tau, is smaller than its gram-negative homolog, yet retains the ability to bind single-stranded dna and contains dna-stimulated atpase activity comparable with e. coli tau. s. aureus tau also stimulates polc, although they do not form as stabile a complex as e. coli polymerase iii.tau. we  demonstrate that the extreme c-terminal residues of polc bind to and function with beta clamps from different bacteria. hence, this polymerase-clamp interaction is highly conserved. additionally, the s. aureus delta wrench of the  clamp loader binds to e. coli beta. the s. aureus clamp loader is even capable of loading e. coli and streptococcus pyogenes beta clamps onto dna. interestingly, s. aureus polc lacks functionality with heterologous beta clamps when they are loaded onto dna by the s. aureus clamp loader, suggesting that the s. aureus clamp loader may have difficulty ejecting from heterologous clamps. nevertheless, these overall findings underscore the conservation in structure and function of gram-positive and gram-negative replicases despite >1 billion years of evolutionary distance between them.

TI  == clinical challenges and unmet needs in the management of complicated skin and skin structure, and soft tissue infections.
AB  == background: skin and soft tissue infections remain among the most frequently encountered infections in surgery, and their severity ranges from mild cellulitis to severe, necrotizing infections with high incidences of morbidity and mortality. most commonly, these disorders result from skin lesions in a susceptible host, but sometimes develop following hematogenous spread from a previously unknown focus. methods: the current literature was reviewed to provide an up-to-date summary of the microbiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and therapy of complicated skin and soft tissue infections. special conditions are also described, such as cellulitis, bite wounds and diabetic foot infections. the potential roles of several new drugs that have become available recently, or are  currently in phase iii clinical trials, are discussed. results: the causative pathogens are mostly gram-positive cocci from a patient's endogenous skin flora,  but complicated infections often involve gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria related to the site and source of infection. classifications are numerous and often confusing, occasionally leading to a prolonged diagnostic workup. therapy should be initiated immediately following clinical diagnosis, including empiric antimicrobial chemotherapy and surgical debridement, if necessary. hospitalization is mandatory for those patients with constitutional symptoms of sepsis, failed outpatient therapy, or deeper infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis. the number and variety of resistant organisms in the community continues to increase steadily, with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) currently the most common. several new drugs that are active against mrsa  are becoming available, and include those active broadly against gram-positive cocci, such as quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, and daptomycin. tigecycline, a new antibiotic of the glycylcycline class, has extended broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including anaerobes and multi-resistant organisms. conclusions: new, promising agents, with activity against multi-drug resistant gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, are aimed at filling the gap in the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.

TI  == clinical evaluation of postpartum vaginal mucus reflects uterine bacterial infection and the immune response in cattle.
AB  == bacteria contaminate the uterus of most dairy cattle after parturition and endometritis causes infertility. an endometritis score can be ascribed based on the vaginal mucus character and odour but it is not clear if the clinical score reflects the number of uterine bacteria or the inflammatory response. the present study tested the hypothesis that clinical evaluation of endometritis reflects the number of bacteria present in the uterus, and the acute phase protein response. swabs (n = 328) were collected from the uterine lumen of dairy cattle, 21 and 28  days postpartum, vaginal mucus was scored for character and odour, and blood samples collected for acute phase protein measurement. bacteria were identified following aerobic and anaerobic culture, and the bacterial growth density was scored semi-quantitatively. when bacteria were categorised by their expected pathogenic potential in the uterus, purulent or fetid odour vaginal mucus was associated with the growth density of pathogenic bacteria but not opportunist contaminants. when bacteria were analysed independently, arcanobacterium pyogenes, proteus and fusobacterium necrophorum growth densities were associated  with mucopurulent or purulent vaginal mucus. the bacterial growth densities for a. pyogenes, escherichia coli, non-hemolytic streptococci, and mannheimia haemolytica were associated with a fetid mucus odour. peripheral plasma concentrations of alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein were higher if there was a fetid compared with a normal vaginal mucus odour (1.50 +/- 0.09 mg/ml versus 1.05 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, p < 0.001), but did not differ significantly between vaginal mucus character scores. the evaluation of the character and odour of vaginal mucus reflects the number of bacteria in the uterus, and the acute phase protein response.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == effect of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis on milk yield in dairy cows.
AB  == our objective was to estimate the effects of the first occurrence of pathogen-specific clinical mastitis (cm) on milk yield in 3071 dairy cows in 2 new york state farms. the pathogens studied were streptococcus spp.,staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, other pathogens grouped together, and "no pathogen isolated." data were collected from october 1999 to july 2001. milk samples were collected from cows showing signs of cm and were sent to the quality milk production services laboratory at cornell university for microbiological culture. the sas statistical procedure proc mixed, with an autoregressive covariance structure, was used to quantify the effect of cm and several other control variables (herd, calving season, parity, month of lactation, j-5 vaccination status, and other diseases) on weekly milk yield. separate models were fitted for primipara and multipara, because of the different shapes of their lactation curves. to observe effects of mastitis, milk weights were divided into  several periods both pre- and postdiagnosis, according to when they were measured in relation to disease occurrence. another category contained cows without the type of cm being modeled. because all pathogens were modeled simultaneously, a control cow was one without cm. among primipara, staph. aureus, e. coli, klebsiella spp., and "no pathogen isolated" caused the greatest losses. milk yield generally began to drop 1 or 2 wk before diagnosis; the greatest loss occurred immediately following diagnosis. mastitic cows often never recovered their potential yield. among older cows, streptococcus spp., staph. aureus, a. pyogenes, e. coli, and klebsiella spp. caused the most significant losses. many multipara that developed cm were actually higher producers before diagnosis than  their nonmastitic herd-mates. as in primipara, milk yield in multipara often began to decline shortly before diagnosis; the greatest loss occurred immediately following diagnosis. milk loss persisted until at least 70 d after diagnosis for  streptococcus spp., klebsiella spp., and a. pyogenes. the tendency for higher producing cows to contract cm may mask its impact on cow health and production. these findings provide dairy producers with more information on which pathogen-specific cm cases should receive treatment and how to manage these cows, thereby reducing cm impact on cow well being and profitability.

TI  == phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  == comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. this process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial dna. many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. two situations can be distinguished: vibrio cholerae, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. these prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile dna elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. in many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific dna sequences. in addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. the current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.

AB  == the survival and surface adherence ability of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in nutrient broth and in five oral liquid pharmaceuticals (nivaquine syrup, cough mixture, paracetamol elixir, cotrimoxazole and vitamin c) were investigated the bacteria grew more in nutrient broth than in the pharmaceuticals (p < 0. 001) and the recovery of stressed cells was enhanced when 3% tween 80 was used as the recovery medium as against the use of normal saline (p < 0.01). the gram-negative bacteria were more adapted to the pharmaceuticals than their gram-positive counterparts. klebsiella pneumoniae and ps. aeruginosa were recovered in large numbers from nivaquine and cotrimoxazole suspensions that did  not support the growth of the other bacteria. the effect of bacterial growth on the physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals was also evaluated the properties were not altered significantly except for ph shifts of 0.3 to 1.1 caused by e. coli and s. aureus in paracetamol and vitamin c. adherence capability was found to correlate with the survival ability of the bacteria. populations on coupons were significantly higher when nutrient broth was used as  the suspending medium compared with any of the pharmaceuticals (p < 0.01). rubber and plastic coupons were significantly more accessible to the bacteria than glass coupon as revealed by the high population of bacteria recovered from their surfaces.

TI  == subcellular sites for bacterial protein export.
AB  == most bacterial proteins destined to leave the cytoplasm are exported to extracellular compartments or imported into the cytoplasmic membrane via the highly conserved seca-yeg pathway. in the present studies, the subcellular distributions of core components of this pathway, seca and secy, and of the secretory protein pre-amyq, were analysed using green fluorescent protein fusions, immunostaining and/or immunogold labelling techniques. it is shown that  seca, secy and (pre-)amyq are located at specific sites near and/or in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacillus subtilis. the localization patterns of these proteins suggest that the sec machinery is organized in spiral-like structures along the cell, with most of the translocases organized in specific clusters along these structures. however, this localization appears to be independent of the helicoidal structures formed by the actin-like cytoskeletal proteins, mreb or mbl. interestingly, the specific localization of seca is dynamic, and depends on  active translation. moreover, reducing the phosphatidylglycerol phospholipids content in the bacterial membrane results in delocalization of seca, suggesting the involvement of membrane phospholipids in the localization process. these data show for the first time that, in contrast to the recently reported uni-exportal site in the coccoid streptococcus pyogenes, multiple sites dedicated to protein export are present in the cytoplasmic membrane of rod-shaped b. subtilis.

AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == cot mattresses as reservoirs of potentially harmful bacteria and the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  == cot mattress materials were investigated as potential reservoirs of bacteria in relation to the sudden infant death syndrome (sids). the sleeping position of the infant significantly influenced bacterial population density of cot mattress polyurethane foams (p<0.0000001) and their covers (p<0.004). staphylococcus aureus was isolated at significantly higher frequency (p<0.03) from the infant's  head region of cot mattress materials. significantly higher bacterial population  densities (p<0.001) were associated with polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses (exposed polyurethane foam), when compared to those from mattresses completely covered by polyvinyl chloride (integral type mattress). the frequency  of isolation of s. aureus from polyurethane foams from non-integral mattresses was also significantly higher (p=0.03) than from foams from the integral type. the following factors were significantly associated with increased frequency of isolation of s. aureus: from the polyurethane foam, previous use of non-integral  mattresses by another child (p=0.03 for all sample sites, p=0.01 for torso region); from the covers, sleeping in the prone position (p=0.003 head region, p=0.001 torso region). prone sleeping was also significantly associated with increased bacterial population levels (p=0.01) and increased frequency of isolation of escherichia coli (p=0.02) from the torso region of cot mattress covers. these findings could explain some recently identified risk factors for sids associated with type and previous use of cot mattresses. clostridium perfringens was isolated at very low frequency and streptococcus pyogenes was not isolated from any cot mattress materials tested.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == strategies developed by bacteria and virus for protection from the human complement system.
AB  == the complement system is an important part of innate immunity providing immediate protection against pathogens without a need for previous exposure. its importance is clearly shown by the fact that patients lacking complement components suffer from fulminant and recurring infections. complement is an explosive cascade, and  in order to control it there are inhibitors present on every human cell and also  circulating in blood. however, many infectious agents have developed strategies to prevent clearance and destruction by complement. some pathogens simply hijack  the host's complement inhibitors, while others are able to produce their own homologues of human inhibitors. knowledge of these mechanisms on a molecular level may aid development of vaccines and novel therapeutic strategies that would be more specific than the use of antibiotics that, apart from causing resistance  problems, also affect the normal flora, the outcome of which could be devastating. in this study the structural requirements and functional consequences of interactions between the major soluble inhibitor of complement c4b-binding protein and neisseria gonorrhoeae, bordetella pertussis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli k1, moraxella catarrhalis and candida albicans are described. furthermore, a novel inhibitor produced by kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is identified and characterized in detail: kcp. it is shown that kcp inhibits classical c3-convertase and presents activated complement factors c4b and c3b for destruction by a serine proteinase, factor i.  using molecular modelling and site-directed mutagenesis, it was possible to localize sites on the surface of kcp required for complement inhibition and it is concluded that kcp uses molecular mechanisms identical to human inhibitors.

TI  == proapoptotic effect of proteolytic activation of matrix metalloproteinases by streptococcus pyogenes thiol proteinase (streptococcus pyrogenic exotoxin b).
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes thiol proteinase, also known as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b (speb), has been suggested to be a major virulence factor in s. pyogenes infection. speb was reported to induce apoptosis of host cells, but its  mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. in this study, we examined the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) in speb-induced apoptosis. we first developed a large-scale preparation of recombinant speb and precursors of human mmp-9 and -2 (prommps) by using escherichia coli rosetta (de3)plyss and baculovirus-insect cell expression systems, respectively. treatment with speb induced effective proteolytic activation of both prommp-9 and -2. when raw264 murine macrophages were incubated with speb-activated prommp-9, the level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) in conditioned medium (cm), assessed by an enzyme immunoassay, was elevated. this increase was completely inhibited by addition of the mmp inhibitor si-27 to the cell culture. the cm also produced marked induction of apoptosis of u937 human monocytic cells. similarly, soluble fas ligand (sfasl) was detected in cm of cultures of sw480 cells expressing fasl  after treatment with speb-activated prommps; this cm also induced apoptosis in u937 cells. speb had a direct effect as well and caused the release of tnf-alpha  and sfasl from the cells. speb-dependent production of mmp-9 and -2 and proapoptotic molecules (tnf-alpha and sfasl) was evident in a murine model of severe invasive s. pyogenes infection. these results suggest that speb or speb-activated mmps contribute to tissue damage and streptococcal invasion in the host via extracellular release of tnf-alpha and sfasl.

AB  == to characterize fibronectin binding with granulicatella adiacens, a causative agent of infective endocarditis, monoclonal antibodies were generated against human fibronectin and selected for their capacity to inhibit the fibronectin binding of the organism. thermolysin and lysyl-endopeptidase digests of fibronectin were characterized by western blot. the epitope of inhibitory monoclonal antibody was found in the central portion of fibronectin known as the  cell-binding domain, and not in the n-terminal portion known to be the binding region of most microbial species, e.g., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. while these two species could bind to both the n-terminal and central portion, escherichia coli and g. adiacens bind only to the latter. excess amounts of free fibronectin in the solution inhibited the bacterial adherence to the n-terminal fibronectin fragment, but not to the central region, thereby suggesting the central region plays a significant role for in vivo bacterial colonization in the presence of high concentrations of soluble fibronectin.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == complement inhibitor c4b-binding protein-friend or foe in the innate immune system?
AB  == the complement system constitutes an important component of the defence against foreign organisms, functioning both in innate and adaptive immune systems. it is  potentially harmful also to the own organism and is therefore tightly regulated by a number of membrane-bound and soluble factors. c4b-binding protein (c4bp) is  a potent circulating soluble inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways of complement. in recent years, the relationships between the structure of c4bp and  its functions have been elucidated using a combination of computer-based molecular analysis and recombinant dna technologies. moreover, two novel functions have recently been ascribed to c4bp. one is the ability of c4bp to localize complement regulatory activity to the surface of apoptotic cells via its interaction with the membrane-binding vitamin k-dependent protein s. the other is the ability of c4bp to act as a survival factor for b cells due to an interaction with cd40. the complement regulatory activity of c4bp is not only beneficial because it is also explored by pathogens such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, bordetella pertussis, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli k1, and candida albicans, that bind c4bp to their surfaces. this contributes to the serum resistance and the pathogenicity of these bacteria. in this review, the structural requirements and functional importance of the interactions between c4bp and its various ligands are discussed.

AB  == background: the wealth of genomic data in bacteria is helping microbiologists understand the factors involved in gene innovation. among these, the expansion and reduction of gene families appears to have a fundamental role in this, but the factors influencing gene family size are unclear. results: the relative content of paralogous genes in bacterial genomes increases with genome size, largely due to the expansion of gene family size in large genomes. bacteria undergoing genome reduction display a parallel process of redundancy elimination, by which gene families are reduced to one or a few members. gene family size is also influenced by sequence divergence and physiological function. large gene families show wider sequence divergence, suggesting they are probably older, and  certain functions (such as metabolite transport mechanisms) are overrepresented in large families. the size of a given gene family is remarkably similar in strains of the same species and in closely related species, suggesting that homologous gene families are vertically transmitted and depend little on horizontal gene transfer (hgt). conclusions: the remarkable preservation of copy  numbers in widely different ecotypes indicates a functional role for the different copies rather than simply a back-up role. when different genera are compared, the increase in phylogenetic distance and/or ecological specialization  disrupts this preservation, albeit in a gradual manner and maintaining an overall similarity, which also supports this view. hgt can have an important role, however, in nonhomologous gene families, as exemplified by a comparison between saprophytic and enterohemorrhagic strains of escherichia coli.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains].
AB  == we determined the antibacterial activities of oral cephems against isolated from  the patients with the respiratory infections, the urinary tract infections, and infections in the obstetrics field of an adult and a child, during the period from 2002 to 2003; streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus  influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli of 40 strains of each, and peptostreptococcus spp. 22 strains. s. pneumoniae and  h. influenzae strains that resistant is regarded were collected mainly, penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae  (prsp) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar) strains. the mics of cephems except cefaclor (ccl) were < or = 0.03 microgram/ml  against all strains of s. pyogenes. the mics of cefteram (cftm) and cefditoren (cdtr) were < or = 0.0125 microgram/ml activity against 7 strains penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae (pssp). however the mic90s of cefditoren (cdtr) was 1 microgram/ml, cefteram (cftm), and cefcapene (cfpn) were 2 micrograms/ml against pisp and prsp, were higher than those of other drugs, but showed slightly higher than pssp. the mic90s of cephems. were 0.5-4 micrograms/ml against strains of e. coli. the mic90s of cftm was 0.5 microgram/ml, and cdtr, cfpn were 1 microgram/ml against e. coli were higher than those of other drugs. the four strains of e. coli however were highly-resistant which mic90s of ccl were more than 32 micrograms/ml were obtains. furthermore it is necessary to pay  much attention to the trend of resistant such as e. coli of cephems. although all strains showed resistant to ampc, mic90 of cephems were 0.25-1 microgram/ml, good activities against k. pneumoniae. against beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-susceptible h. influenzae (blnas) 23 strains the mic90s of ccl and other cephems were 64 micrograms/ml and 0.25-8 micrograms/ml. the mic90s of cdtr  and cftm were < or = 1 microgram/ml of blnar (15 strains). however there of cfdn  and cpdx were 8 micrograms/ml and ccl were > or = 16 micrograms/ml. two strains which were produced beta-lactamase were highly--abpc resistant. although b. catarrhalis all strains were produced beta-lactamase and cephems except for ccl showed better susceptibility than ampc. the mic90s of cephems were 0.25-2 micrograms/ml against peptostreptococcus spp.

TI  == purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of native and selenomethionine class i tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (ec 4.1.2.40) is situated at the branching of  the tagatose-6-phosphate and embden-meyerhof-parnas (glycolysis) metabolic pathways, where it catalyzes the reversible cleavage of tagatose-1,6-bisphosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. the recombinant protein from streptococcus pyogenes was overexpressed in escherichia coli in its  native and selenomethionine-derivative forms and purified using ion-exchange and  hydrophobic interaction chromatography. orthorhombic crystals suitable for structural analysis were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method for both isoforms. the crystals belong to space group p2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 63.7, b = 108.1, c = 238.7 a for the native form and a = 64.1, b = 108.3, c = 239.8 a for the selenomethionine derivative. the asymmetric unit contains four protomers, corresponding to a crystal volume per protein weight (v(m)) of 2.8 a(3) da(-1) and a solvent content of 56% by volume.

TI  == bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  == objective: subperiosteal abscess (sa) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (am). of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated  from the sa. we suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess  cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of am. the purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause sa and mastoid cortex erosion in children. material and methods: the medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for sa between may 1984 and april 2002 were  evaluated. results: mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses purulent discharge was obtained from the sa cavity in 28 cases. the commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, followed by streptococcus pneumoniae. hemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. conclusions: mastoid sa is a unilateral disease that can recur. early administration of anti-staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with sa as a complication of am.

TI  == identification of new candidate vaccine antigens made by streptococcus pyogenes:  purification and characterization of 16 putative extracellular lipoproteins.
AB  == putative extracellular lipoproteins made by group a streptococcus (gas) are the focus of this study, which was designed to identify new candidate vaccine antigens. bioinformatic analysis of a serotype m1 gas strain identified 30 open-reading frames encoding putative lipoproteins. the genes encoding the mature form of 29 of these proteins were cloned, and 16 recombinant proteins were overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. the genes encoding these 16 proteins were highly conserved in gas strains for which genome  sequence data are available (serotypes m1, m3, m5, m12, m18, and m28). mice inoculated subcutaneously with gas and humans with gas pharyngitis and invasive infections seroconverted to most of the 16 recombinant proteins, which indicates  that these lipoproteins were produced during infection. the blood of mice actively immunized with 5 of the 16 recombinant proteins had significantly (p<.05) increased growth-inhibitory activity, compared with the blood of unimmunized mice, which identified these proteins as potential new vaccine candidates.

TI  == bacterial responses to neutrophil phagocytosis.
AB  == purpose of review: this review focuses on adaptive bacterial interactions with neutrophils, emphasizing information communicated within the past year about bacterial factors that respond to contact with or phagocytosis by pmn. recent findings: since the discovery of type iii and iv secretion, progress in the analysis of bacterial interactions with host phagocytes has been extensive but largely focused on the macrophage. the remarkable growth of information about bacterial subversion of macrophage metabolism has been summarized in several excellent reviews. the scope of progress on neutrophil-bacteria interactions is more limited and dominated by recent studies of the granulocyte pathogen, anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis. summary: for many pathogens, contact with or ingestion by phagocytes elicits a vigorous but varied microbial response. the response repertoire includes activation of type iii and type iv secretion systems that inject effector molecules into the host cell. effectors modify host cell signaling and metabolic pathways to favor survival of the microbe. whereas microbial secretory structures are few in kind and relatively conserved, effector molecules are numerous and variable. effectors may promote phagocytosis by nonphagocytic cells or suppress phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. they may suppress assembly or misdirect localization of the phagocyte nadph oxidase that is responsible for generating toxic oxidants, and they may suppress phagosome-lysosome fusion. phagocytosed bacteria may also up-regulate the expression of defensive proteins that attenuate the effects of phagocyte-derived antimicrobial toxins. these pathogenic stratagems probably have their origins in the competition among single-celled organisms, eukaryotes versus prokaryotes, that arose early in evolution.

TI  == acylation of sc4 dodecapeptide increases bactericidal potency against gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains.
AB  == we have conjugated dodecyl and octadecyl fatty acids to the n-terminus of sc4, a  potently bactericidal, helix-forming peptide 12-mer (klfkrhlkwkii), and examined  the bactericidal activities of the resultant sc4 'peptide-amphiphile' molecules.  sc4 peptide-amphiphiles showed up to a 30-fold increase in bactericidal activity  against gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and  bacillus anthracis), including s. aureus strains resistant to conventional antibiotics, but little or no increase in bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). fatty acid  conjugation improved endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) neutralization by 3- to 6-fold. although acylation somewhat increased lysis of human erythrocytes, it did not increase lysis of endothelial cells, and the haemolytic effects occurred at concentrations 10- to 100-fold higher than those required for bacterial cell lysis. for insight into the mechanism of action of sc4 peptide-amphiphiles, cd, nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy studies were performed in micelle and liposome  models of eukaryotic and bacterial cell membranes. cd indicated that sc4 peptide-amphiphiles had the strongest helical tendencies in liposomes mimicking bacterial membranes, and strong membrane integration of the sc4 peptide-amphiphiles was observed using tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy under these conditions; results that correlated with the increased bactericidal activities of sc4 peptide-amphiphiles. nmr structural analysis in micelles demonstrated that the two-thirds of the peptide closest to the fatty acid tail exhibited a helical conformation, with the positively-charged side of the amphipathic helix interacting more with the model membrane surface. these results indicate that conjugation of a fatty acid chain to the sc4 peptide enhances membrane interactions, stabilizes helical structure in the membrane-bound state and increases bactericidal potency.

TI  == acute mastoiditis in southern israel: a twelve year retrospective study (1990 through 2001).
AB  == background: acute mastoiditis is a serious complication of acute otitis media (aom) and has been increasingly reported in the last decade. objectives: to report the experience accumulated with acute mastoiditis at the soroka university medical center, beer-sheva, israel, in a period of increasing antimicrobial resistance with streptococcus pneumoniae. patients and methods: we reviewed the records of all children with acute mastoiditis hospitalized from 1990 through 2001. acute mastoiditis was diagnosed when one or more of the physical signs of mastoiditis (swelling, erythema, tenderness of the retroauricular area and anteroinferior displacement of the auricle) were diagnosed in the presence of concomitant or recent (< or =4 weeks) aom. results: one hundred sixteen episodes  of acute mastoiditis occurred in 101 children age 2 months to 14 years (median, 25 months; 19% <1 year old). the average yearly incidence was 6.1 cases per 100 000 population <14 years old, with a significant increase in the number of cases  during the study period. acute mastoiditis was the first evidence of aom in 10 (10%) patients. fever >38 degrees c and >15,000 wbc/mm3 were present in 67 and 43% of cases, respectively. irritability, retroauricular swelling, redness and protrusion of the auricle occurred more commonly in patients <3 years old (79, 90, 84 and 76% vs. 28, 42, 45 and 30%, respectively, in patients > or =3 years old; p < 0.002). computed tomography scans were performed in 54 of 116 (47%) cases and revealed bone destruction in 38 (70%). periosteal abscess and lateral sinus vein thrombosis were diagnosed in 8 and 2 patients, respectively. simple mastoidectomy was done in 32 of 116 (28%) cases, after no response to intravenous antibiotics was observed; ventilation tubes were inserted in 12 patients. cultures were obtained at admission in 83 (72%) episodes (71 by tympanocentesis and 12 from ear discharges). overall 43 pathogens were isolated: 34 at admission; 14 at surgery; and 5 at both occasions. the most commonly isolated organisms were s. pneumoniae (14 of 43, 33%; 4 penicillin-nonsusceptible), streptococcus pyogenes (11 of 43, 26%), nontypable haemophilus influenzae (6 of 43, 14%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 of 43, 12%) and escherichia coli (4 of 43, 9%). all s.  pneumoniae organisms were isolated between 1996 and 2001. conclusions: (1) the incidence of acute mastoiditis in children in southern israel is greater than that reported in the literature; (2) a significant increase in the number of cases was recorded during the study period; (3) the clinical picture of acute mastoiditis was more severe in infants and young children; (4) the pathogen distribution in acute mastoiditis differs from that of aom with significantly higher rates of s. pyogenes and lower rates of nontypable h. influenzae recovery; (5) penicillin-nonsusceptible s. pneumoniae played only a minor role in the etiology of acute mastoiditis in southern israel.

TI  == epidemiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections in the usa and europe: a guide to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  == susceptibility data for all organisms associated with a range of skin and soft tissue infections (ssti) in hospitalised patients were studied. data were reported by clinical laboratories in the usa, france, germany, italy and spain during 2001 which participate in the surveillance network (tsn). staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most prevalent pathogens in all countries. mrsa was detected in 44.4, 34.7, 12.4, 41.8 and 32. 4% of s. aureus in each country, respectively. the majority of mrsa were cross resistant to other compound classes tested except for vancomycin (100% susceptible) trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with range 1.7% (france) to 15.9% (italy) resistant, and gentamicin with range 12.2% (france) to 87.0% (italy) resistant. more than 99.0% of mssa tested susceptible to ceftriaxone and >94.9% to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. 87.2% (france) to 94.6% of mssa (germany) were ciprofloxacin susceptible; 73.2% (usa) to 86.6% (spain) were erythromycin susceptible; 85.4% (italy) to 99.2% (france) were gentamicin susceptible. mssa were more frequently found and generally more antibiotic susceptible from out patients. overall, 100% of streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pyogenes were susceptible to penicillin, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. macrolide resistance  was common among s. agalactiae (20.7%, germany to 10%, italy and spain), s. pyogenes (19.2%, france to 11.1%, usa) and viridans streptococci (25.7%, france to 14.1%, germany). vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. were uncommon outside  the usa (17.5%) and italy (7.4%). for all countries susceptibility of e. coli was 100% to imipenem, >98.7% to amikacin, >96.0% to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. susceptibility of e. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin was 77.6% in spain to 94.3% in germany. klebsiella spp., proteus spp., citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. displayed varying susceptibilities between countries to drugs tested. putative extended spectrum beta-lactamase expression in e. coli remained rare comprising 4-5% of isolates in usa, italy and spain and in france and germany <2%. for p. aeruginosa piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem and ceftazidime were the most active compounds tested irrespective of region. surveillance data should be  considered when selecting empirical therapy for treating ssti.

TI  == identification and characterization of htsa, a second heme-binding protein made by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == group a streptococci (gas) can use heme and hemoproteins as sources of iron. however, the machinery for heme acquisition in gas has not been firmly revealed.  recently, we identified a novel heme-associated cell surface protein (shp) made by gas. the shp gene is cotranscribed with eight downstream genes, including spy1795, spy1794, and spy1793 encoding a putative abc transporter (designated htsabc). in this study, spy1795 (designated htsa) was cloned from a serotype m1 strain, and recombinant htsa was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. htsa binds 1 heme molecule per molecule of protein. htsa was produced in vitro and localized to the bacterial cell surface. gas up-regulated transcription of htsa in human blood compared with that in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract. the level of the htsa transcript dramatically increased under metal cation-restricted conditions compared with that under metal cation-replete conditions. the cation content, cell surface location, and gene transcription of htsa were also compared with those of mtsa and spy0385, the lipoprotein components of two other putative iron acquisition abc transporters of gas. our results suggest that htsabc is an abc transporter that may participate in heme acquisition in gas.

TI  == inhibition of fibronectin binding of some bacterial cells by subtle ph increase within the physiological range.
AB  == the fibronectin (fn)-binding ability of microorganisms is considered to be involved in their pathogenicities. granulicatella adiacens, a member of the oral  flora and a causative agent of culture-negative infective endocarditis, showed nearly maximum binding to immobilized fn at ph 7.2 but greatly reduced binding at a slightly higher ph 7.4 and almost no binding at ph 7.6 in the presence of physiological concentration of nacl (0.15 m). a similar ph-sensitive fn-binding property was noted with escherichia coli and abiotrophia defectiva, but not with  streptococcus pyogenes nor staphylococcus aureus. in contrast, bindings to laminin and fibrinogen observed for some of these strains were unaffected by the  same ph changes. this fastidious ph-dependency of fn-binding abilities of some bacteria warns that the ph condition must be seriously considered in the in vitro assay of bacterial adherence to fibronectin.

TI  == a highly sensitive immuno-pcr assay for detecting group a streptococcus.
AB  == a highly sensitive hybrid assay, based on immuno polymerase chain reaction (immuno-pcr) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) techniques, was developed for the detection of pathogenic group a streptococcus (strep a). cells  were disrupted by sonication and then coated onto the walls of maxisorp microtiter plates. next, biotinylated anti-group a monoclonal antibody (mab) was  bound to the antigen and then linked, via a streptavidin (stv) bridge, to biotinylated reporter dna. after extensive washing, the denatured reporter dna was transferred to pcr tubes, amplified, electrophoresed, and used as the signal  for detection of bacteria. the minimum detection limit of this assay is the equivalent of approximately one one-thousandth of a streptococcus pyogenes cell,  even in the presence of 100,000 escherichia coli cells. the combination of multiple antigens per cell and pcr amplification provides the extreme sensitivity in this immuno-pcr assay. no cross-reaction was found with other streptococcus species. we also directly linked the anti-group a monoclonal antibody to dna using succinimidyl 4-[n-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (smcc). the sensitivity using directly linked antibody-reporter dna was approximately 10 cells. because this assay could be adapted for detection of many different bacteria in a variety of sample types, we tested the potential for interference from substances that could be present in clinical, food, and environmental samples. sonicated meat or human plasma did not inhibit detection; however, extracts of concentrated soil samples were somewhat inhibitory. this highly specific, sensitive, and robust assay could be applied to clinical detection of group a streptococcus and serves as a model for other immuno-pcr assays.

TI  == many chemokines including ccl20/mip-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor ccr6 with the cc chemokine ligand ccl20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (mip-3alpha). structural analysis of ccl20/mip-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered  to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. here, we report that similar to defensins, ccl20/mip-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. additionally,  by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17  human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on  the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.

TI  == the essential c family dnae polymerase is error-prone and efficient at lesion bypass.
AB  == dnae-type dna polymerases belong to the c family of dna polymerases and are responsible for chromosomal replication in prokaryotes. like most closely related gram-positive cells, streptococcus pyogenes has two dnae homologs pol c and dnae; both are essential to cell viability. pol c is an established replicative polymerase, and dnae has been proposed to serve a replicative role. in this report, we characterize s. pyogenes dnae polymerase and find that it is highly error-prone. dnae can bypass coding and noncoding lesions with high efficiency. error-prone extension is accomplished by either of two pathways, template-primer  misalignment or direct primer extension. the bypass of abasic sites is accomplished mainly through "dntp-stabilized" misalignment of template, thereby generating (-1) deletions in the newly synthesized strand. this mechanism may be  similar to the dntp-stabilized misalignment mechanism used by the y family of dna polymerases and is the first example of lesion bypass and error-prone synthesis catalyzed by a c family polymerase. thus, dnae may function in an error-prone capacity that may be essential in gram-positive cells but not gram-negative cells, suggesting a fundamental difference in dna metabolism between these two classes of bacteria.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

AB  == combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the  common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. this means that they are  an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases  of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after  the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against gram-positive cocci (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), gram-negative cocci (neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis and others), gram-negative bacilli  (nonhospital strains of haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well  as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis).  it is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. it is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. the new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. in summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children.

TI  == a novel member of glycoside hydrolase family 88: overexpression, purification, and characterization of unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1.
AB  == unsaturated beta-glucuronyl hydrolase of bacillus sp. gl1 catalyzes the hydrolytic release of unsaturated glucuronic acids from oligosaccharides produced through the reactions of polysaccharide lyases such as gellan, xanthan, hyaluronate, and chondroitin lyases. an overexpression system for the enzyme was  constructed in escherichia coli cells involving regulation of the enzyme gene under the t7 promoter and terminator. the expression level of the enzyme in e. coli cells was 250-fold higher than that in bacillus sp. gl1 cells. the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells was purified and characterized. the optimal ph and temperature, and substrate specificity of the purified enzyme were similar to those of the native enzyme from bacillus sp. gl1 cells, although the enzyme expressed in e. coli cells underwent self-assembly into polymeric forms through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. circular dichroism analysis indicated that the secondary structure of the enzyme was rich in alpha-helices. genes showing high identity (over 40% identity) with that of the enzyme were found in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria, such as streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae, which cause serious diseases (e.g., meningitis and  pneumonia). therefore, the enzyme of bacillus sp. gl1 and the streptococcal proteins form a new glycoside hydrolase family, 88.

TI  == colonization of burn wounds in ain shams university burn unit.
AB  == a prospective study was carried out on 70 burned patients admitted to the burn unit, ain shams university hospital, cairo, with the aim to verify the pattern of microbial colonization of burn wounds. throughout the study period starting from  1 june 1999 till 31 may 2001, 281 sampling procedures (surface swabs) were performed from the burn wounds. a total of 301 microbial isolates were grown in cultures. eight different species of bacteria, and only one species of candida (c. albicans) were detected. there was no incidence of recovery of anaerobic microorganisms. our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.6%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (15.2%), then escherichia coli (13.6%), staphylococcus aureus (13.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11.6%), streptococcus pyogenes (8.3%), enterobacter species (6.6%), and lastly streptococcus faecalis and candida albicans (5.9 and 3.6%, respectively). studying the time-related changes in burn wound microbial colonization showed an initial predominance of gram-positive cocci upon admission (70.7%) over gram-negative bacilli (27.6%). during the first 5 days, gram-negative bacilli started to predominate (55.7%) over gram-positive cocci (40.3%). burn wound sampling performed starting from the sixth day onwards, revealed further prevalence of gram-negative bacilli (72.7%) over gram-positive cocci (22.7%). as for candida albicans, there was a gradual increase in the frequency of its recovery as time elapsed from admission. it is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. this would enable early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall infection-related morbidity and mortality.

TI  == adhesive surface proteins of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae bind to polystyrene, fibronectin, and type i and iv collagens.
AB  == erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a gram-positive bacterium that causes erysipelas  in animals and erysipeloid in humans. we found two adhesive surface proteins of e. rhusiopathiae and determined the nucleotide sequences of the genes, which were colocalized and designated rspa and rspb. the two genes were present in all of the serovars of e. rhusiopathiae strains examined. the deduced rspa and rspb proteins contain the c-terminal anchoring motif, lpxtg, which is preceded by repeats of consensus amino acid sequences. the consensus sequences are composed of 78 to 92 amino acids and repeat 16 and 3 times in rspa and rspb, respectively. adhesive surface proteins of other gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes adhesin-like protein, streptococcus pyogenes protein f2 and f2-like protein, streptococcus dysgalactiae fnbb, and staphylococcus aureus cna, share the same consensus repeats. furthermore, the n-terminal regions of rspa and rspb  showed characteristics of the collagen-binding domain that was described for cna. rspa and rspb were expressed in escherichia coli as histidine-tagged fusion proteins and purified. the recombinant proteins showed a high degree of capacity  to bind to polystyrene and inhibited the binding of e. rhusiopathiae onto the abiotic surface in a dose dependent manner. in a solid-phase binding assay, both  of the recombinant proteins bound to fibronectin, type i and iv collagens, indicating broad spectrum of their binding ability. it was suggested that both rspa and rspb were exposed on the cell surface of e. rhusiopathiae, as were the bacterial cells agglutinated by the anti-rspa immunoglobulin g (igg) and anti-rspb igg. rspa and rspb were present both in surface-antigen extracts and the culture supernatants of e. rhusiopathiae fujisawa-smr (serovar 1a) and se-9 (serovar 2). the recombinant rspa, but not rspb, elicited protection in mice against experimental challenge. these results suggest that rspa and rspb participate in initiation of biofilm formation through their binding abilities to abiotic and biotic surfaces.

AB  == in order to assess the epidemiological, microbiological, and clinical features of cellulitis and soft tissue infection occurring during the course of hiv disease,  clinical and laboratory data of 2221 hospitalizations carried out since 1991 were retrospectively examined, and 67 bacteriologically-proven episodes of cellulitis-soft tissue infection were identified (3.02% of overall admissions). among the 92 cultured pathogens, staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent (46  cases), followed by pseudomonas spp., escherichia coli, and streptococcus pyogenes; 38.1% of patients had a polymicrobial infection. i.v. drug use (p<.02)  and the male gender (p<.05), were significantly associated with the occurrence of these complications, while a great variation in the severity of underlying immunodeficiency was shown. an elevated rate (83.6%) of episodes of cellulitis or soft tissue infection were community-acquired in origin; the comprehensive frequency of these episodes significantly dropped during the highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) era (p<.01). limbs were involved in over 80% of episodes, and an hematogenous dissemination of bacterial infection (which occurred in 25.4% of cases), proved significantly related to a cd4+ lymphocyte count <100 cells/microl (p<.03), and an absolute neutrophil count <1000 cells/microl (p<.05). s. aureus strains showed an elevated in vitro resistance rate to penicillin, ampicillin, and rifampin, and a 21.7% rate of methicillin-resistance, while among the 29 gram-negative microorganisms, resistance to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins, and that to amoxycillin-clavulanate and second-generation cephalosporin, occurred in over 90% and 60% of tested strains, respectively. all episodes of hiv-associated cellulitis and soft tissue infection were favorably treated in 5-16 days, in over 60% of cases with associated beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics; a recurrence of staphylococcal cellulitis occurred in 4 patients only, 6-17 months  after the initial episode. cellulitis and soft tissue infection are underestimated complications of hiv disease, but they have a broad etiological and clinical spectrum, are predominantly community-acquired, and are responsible  for an appreciable morbidity, due to the supporting role of i.v. drug addiction,  and the frequent hematogenous dissemination (which proved to be significantly related to the progression of immunodeficiency and underlying disease). the frequent polymicrobial etiology requires a combination antimicrobial therapy (to  be guided by in vitro susceptibility studies), which may avoid a complicated and  recurrent disease course in the great majority of cases.

TI  == hrca is a negative regulator of the dnak and groesl operons of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the genome of streptococcus pyogenes, an important human pathogen, encodes homologs of the principal bacterial heat shock proteins dnak and groes, -el, as well as hrca, a negative regulator of dnak and groesl expression in other gram-positive bacteria. using nuclease protection assays to measure dnak/groesl mrna abundance and a "non-polar" insertion to disrupt hrca, we demonstrate that heat shock triggers a 4- to 8-fold increase in dnak and groesl-specific mrnas within 5 min of the temperature shift and that hrca is a negative regulator of s. pyogenes dnak/groesl mrna abundance in unstressed s. pyogenes. although the loss  of hrca elevated dnak and groesl mrna levels under non-heat shock conditions, the relative abundance of these rnas increased further in heat shocked s. pyogenes, suggesting an additional element contributing to their synthesis or stability.

TI  == streptococcus dysgalactiae-derived mitogen (sdm), a novel bacterial superantigen: characterization of its biological activity and predicted tertiary structure.
AB  == a mitogenic substance, designated streptococcus dysgalactiae-derived mitogen (sdm), was purified from s. dysgalactiae culture supernatant, and the gene encoding the mitogen was cloned. both native and recombinant sdm expressed in escherichia coli significantly activated human v beta 1+ and v beta 23+ t cells in association with major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii molecules on  accessory cells, indicating that sdm possesses superantigenic properties. the sdm gene consists of two segments encoding a signal peptide and a mature 25 kda protein composed of 212 amino acids. three of 34 s. dysgalactiae strains but none of 28 streptococcus pyogenes strains examined carried sdm. phylogenetic analysis  indicated that sdm belongs to a family distinct from established bacterial superantigens. sdm showed around 30% homology with other superantigens at the amino acid sequence level. the tertiary structure of sdm was predicted by modelling onto streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin c and streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin z-2, both of which share highly homologous structure-determining regions. sdm showed overall structural similarity to both these superantigens. this is the first study to characterize fully a bacterial superantigen from s. dysgalactiae.

AB  == as the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (banan), mics of cefpodoxime (cpdx, an active form of banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22  species from 15 medical institutions all over japan from june 2000 to march 2001  were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the japanese society of chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. in this study, remarkable change in the activity of cpdx was observed in streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus  influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before banan was launched. this cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate s. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (blnar) h. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated  in 1989 when banan was launched. other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. however, cpdx showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against prsp. against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and moraxella catarrhalis, cpdx also showed comparatively good activity with mic90 of < or = 4 micrograms/ml, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its  marketing. against quinolones-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, cpdx showed excellent activity with mic90 of 0.5 microgram/ml. against members of the family  enterobacteriaceae except for citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, and morganella morganii, cpdx showed good activity. however, in escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. proteus spp., and providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including cpdx. against peptostreptococcus spp., mic90 of cpdx was 8 micrograms/ml and its mic range was  widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml, which were similar to those in  the studies before its marketing. in this study, cpdx showed the decrease in the  activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, cpdx maintained good activity. furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.

TI  == maturation processing and characterization of streptopain.
AB  == streptopain is a cysteine protease expressed by streptococcus pyogenes. to study  the maturation mechanism of streptopain, wild-type and q186n, c192s, h340r, n356d and w357a mutant proteins were expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. proteolytic analyses showed that the maturation of prostreptococcal  pyrogenic exotoxin b zymogen (pro-spe b) involves eight intermediates with a combination of cis- and trans-processing. based on the sequences of these intermediates, the substrate specificity of streptopain favors a hydrophobic residue at the p2 site. the relative autocatalytic rates of these mutants exhibited the order q186n > w357a > n356d, c192s, h340r. interestingly, the n356d mutant containing protease activity could not be converted into the 28-kda form by autoprocessing. this observation suggested that asn(356) might involve the cis-processing of the propeptide. in addition, the maturation rates of pro-spe b  with trypsin and plasmin were 10- and 60-fold slower than that with active mature streptopain. these findings indicate that active mature streptopain likely plays  the most important role in the maturation of pro-spe b under physiological conditions.

AB  == streptococcus pyogenes psm19035-encoded epsilon (10.7 kda) and zeta (32.4 kda) proteins are necessary to secure stable plasmid inheritance in bacteria, with zeta acting as toxin that kills plasmid-deprived cells and epsilon as an antitoxin that neutralises the activity of zeta. the epsilon and zeta proteins co-purify as a stable complex that, according to analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration, exists as epsilon2zeta2 heterotetramer in solution. co-crystals of the epsilon2zeta2 complex contain epsilon and zeta in 1:1 molar ratio. unfolding studies monitoring circular dichroic and fluorescence changes show that the zeta protein has a significantly lower thermodynamic stability than the epsilon protein both in free state and in the complex. proteolytic studies indicate that zeta protein is more stable in the epsilon2zeta2 complex than in the free state. in vivo studies reveal a short half-life of the epsilon antitoxin (-18 min) and a long lifetime of the zeta toxin (>60 min). when transcription-translation of a plasmid containing the epsilon and zeta genes was  inhibited, cell death was observed after a short lag phase that correlates with the disappearance of the epsilon protein from the background.

TI  == keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  == human beta defensin 2 (hbetad-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. we hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2, measured by reverse transcription-pcr, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetad-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. expression of hbetad-2 was induced consistently by s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of s.  pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetad-2. no correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetad-2. s. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetad-2 than s. epidermidis. we conclude that the ability to induce hbetad-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetad-2 expression by s. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. induction of expression  of hbetad-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable s. epidermidis to survive on  the skin surface and modulate hbetad-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.

AB  == a spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. the system (termed lexsas, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. we studied the lexsas as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to  transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. if successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. in this study, we used  the lexsas for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, or streptococcus pyogenes. bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. the results indicate that the lexsas could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.

TI  == structural and functional studies of complement inhibitor c4b-binding protein.
AB  == c4b-binding protein (c4bp) is a potent inhibitor of the classical pathway of the  complement system. this large plasma glycoprotein consists of seven identical alpha-chains and a unique beta-chain held together by disulphide bridges. both types of subunits are composed almost exclusively of complement control protein domains (ccps). using homology-based computer modelling and mutagenesis of recombinant proteins we have localized binding sites for several ligands of c4bp: complement factor c4b, heparin and vitamin k-dependent anticoagulant protein s (ps). we found that c4b requires ccp1-3 of the alpha-chain for binding. the interaction is ionic in nature and mediated by a cluster of positively charged amino acids present on the interface between ccp1 and ccp2 of the alpha-chain. loss of c4b-binding resulted in a loss of all inhibitory functions of c4bp within the classical pathway of complement. binding of heparin required ccps 1-3 of the  alpha-chain, with ccp2 being the most important, as well as the cluster of positively charged amino acids involved in binding of c4b. the interaction between c4bp and ps is of very high affinity and conveyed by a cluster of surface exposed hydrophobic amino acids localized on ccp1 of the beta-chain. furthermore, c4bp is captured on the surface of several pathogens, which may contribute to their serum resistance and pathogenicity. we have localized interaction of c4bp with neisseria gonorrhoeae, bordetella pertussis, streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli to various regions of the alpha-chain.

AB  == bronchial asthma is an intercurrent disease that affects a major portion of the population. neither its etiopathogenesis nor its complications have been fully established. the purpose of this study was to determine the composition of oropharyngeal bacterial flora in asthmatic patients and compare it with oropharyngeal bacterial flora in a group of healthy patients in order to establish its relationship with the pathogenesis of asthma and its complications. a sample consisting of 116 pharyngeal swabs was analysed from march 1995 to december 1996. 58 of the total amount of pharyngeal swabs corresponded to asthmatic patients (during asthmatic crisis), while the other 58 corresponded to  healthy subjects. common bacteriological culture techniques were carried out in order to obtain the bacteriological diagnosis. the results showed that isolation  of transitory flora bacteria in asthmatic patients was 75.8%, which was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the control group (27.5%). streptococcus  pyogenes was the most frequent isolated bacteria in the group of asthmatic patients (17.2%), while escherichia coli was the most frequent bacteria in the control group. no significant difference was found regarding sex and the presence of transitory flora bacteria. it was also found that enterobacteria and non fermenting negative gram bacillus increased with age in both groups; a higher incidence was observed in the group of 40-year-old subjects. these finding confirm the existence of a relationship between the asthmatic condition and the percentage of transitory bacterial flora carriers. the explanation to this phenomenon might be the frequent use of antibiotics and the possible contamination of the micro-nebulization equipment used for the treating the asthma crisis. this data must be considered when applying empiric therapy in asthmatic patients complicated with pneumonia. the possibility that certain infectious agents, including bacteria, could play a role in asthma pathogenesis is one of the questions that should be answered in future studies on this topic.

AB  == analysis of the genome sequence of a serotype m1 group a streptococcus (gas) strain identified a gene encoding a previously undescribed putative cell surface  protein. the gene was cloned from a serotype m1 strain, and the recombinant protein was overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. the purified protein was associated with heme in a 1:1 stoichiometry. this streptococcal heme-associated protein, designated shp, was produced in vitro by gas, located on the bacterial cell surface, and accessible to specific antibody raised against the purified recombinant protein. mice inoculated subcutaneously with gas and humans with invasive infections and pharyngitis caused by gas seroconverted to shp, indicating that shp was produced in vivo. the blood of mice actively immunized with shp had significantly higher bactericidal activity than the blood of unimmunized mice. the shp gene was cotranscribed with eight contiguous genes, including homologues of an abc transporter involved in iron uptake in gram-negative bacteria. our results indicate that shp is a novel cell surface heme-associated protein.

TI  == production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in the nonspecific acute phase response enhances host resistance to bacterial infection.
AB  == mice mounting an acute phase response, induced by sterile inflammation after a single s.c. injection of casein 24 h beforehand, were remarkably protected against lethal infection with gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. this was associated with enhanced early clearance of bacteremia, greater phagocytosis and  oxidative burst responses by neutrophils, and enhanced recruitment of neutrophils into tissues compared with control, nonacute phase mice. casein-induced inflammation was also associated with increased concentrations of g-csf in serum, and administration of neutralizing ab to this cytokine completely abrogated protection against escherichia coli infection after casein pretreatment. injection of recombinant murine g-csf between 3 and 24 h before infection conferred the same protection as casein injection. in contrast, the casein-induced acute phase response affected neither serum values of tnf-alpha, il-1 beta, or il-6 after e. coli infection nor susceptibility to lps toxicity. furthermore, protection against infection was unaffected in il-1r knockout mice,  which have deficient acute phase plasma protein responses, or after nonspecific inhibition of acute phase protein synthesis by d-galactosamine or specific depletion of complement c3 by cobra venom factor. increased production of g-csf in the acute phase response is thus a key physiological component of host defense, and pretreatment with g-csf to prevent bacterial infection in at-risk patients now merits further study, especially in view of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

TI  == antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  == the antibiotic and chlorhexidine (chx) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus (not mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (mbc) and/or minimal inhibitory (mic) concentrations. non-fermentative bacteria tolerated chx at high concentrations; gram-positive cocci, especially s. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. we found a good correlation between chx and  antibiotic susceptibility in both mic and mbc among gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in mbc among gram-positive bacteria. resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate  increased chx resistance among gram-negative bacteria. this finding gives clinicians the ability to predict chx susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.

TI  == the hyaluronan lyase of streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage h4489a.
AB  == many pathogenic streptococci produce extracellular hyaluronan lyases which are thought to aid the spread of the organism in host tissues. in addition, several phages of group a streptococci are known to synthesize a bound form of hyaluronidase. it has been suggested that the function of this hyaluronidase is to facilitate penetration of the hyaluronan capsule by phage and thus to gain access for the phage to the cell surface of the host streptococcus [hynes, hancock and ferretti (1995) infect. immun. 63, 3015-3020]. in the present work, the hyaluronidase of streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage h4489a, expressed in e. coli, has been purified and characterized. the enzyme was shown to be a lyase with a distributive action pathway. unlike most bacterial hyaluronidases that have been characterized, the phage enzyme was found to specifically cleave hyaluronan, which adds credence to the view that its function is to digest the hyaluronan capsule of the host organism. this bacteriophage lyase may provide a practical alternative to the lyase from streptomyces hyalurolyticus as a reagent  for the specific cleavage of hyaluronan.

TI  == mononuclear cell response to enterobacteria and gram-positive cell walls of normal intestinal microbiota in early rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.
AB  == objective: to study whether enterobacteria and gram-positive bacterial cell walls (bcw) derivedfrom normal intestinal microbiota are involved in the etiopathogenesis of early rheumatoid arthritis (ra). methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (sfmc) were isolatedfrom patients with early ra (the average duration of 5 months) and the controls (other types of inflammatory arthritis). the mononuclear cell proliferation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) responses to heat-killed salmonella enteritidis (se). yersinia enterocolitica (ye), and escherichia coli (ec), and to gram-positive bcw derived from four common intestinal indigenous bacteria, eubacterium aerofaciens (ea), eubacterium limosum (el), lactobacillus casei (lc), and lactobacillus fermentum (lf), and a bcw derived from a pathogen, streptococcus pyogenes (sp) were investigated. results:  39% or 56% of patients with early ra showed significant proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc against enterobacteria, respectively. in other types of arthritis, corresponding figures were 59% or 66%. when bcw were used as antigens, 8.1% or 23% of patients with early ra showed proliferation responses by pbmc or sfmc, respectively. in other types of arthritis the corresponding figures were 7.5% or 35%, respectively. however, tnf-alpha production by sfmc stimulated by ea bcw, se, ye or ec, was significantly higher in early ra than in other types of arthritis. conclusion: these results suggest that sfmc reacting with enterobacteria or bcw exist in some patients with early ra, but also in other types of inflammatory arthritis. intestinal bacterial agents may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of ra, but the effect appears to be non-specific.

AB  == the proteins in the culture supernatant (exoproteins) from streptococcus pyogenes serotype m1 were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and their n-terminal amino acid sequences were determined. the amino acid sequences were compared to sequences in the s. pyogenes genome database. the coding sequence showed similarity to sequences of two genes, mf2-v ( mf2 variant) and mf3, which  had sequence similarity to genes encoding mitogenic factor (mf); mf has dnase activity. the recombinant genes were expressed in escherichia coli and the proteins were synthesized. mf2-v and mf3 had dnase activity. the activity of mf2-v was localized to the c-terminal half of the protein. the mf3 gene was shown to be present in most clinically isolated strains of s. pyogenes tested, and the  mf2gene was detected in 20% of the isolates. the products of the mf2 and mf3 genes in clinically isolated s. pyogenes strains were thus shown to be dnases.

TI  == ceftriaxone activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated in us clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa.
AB  == ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the usa in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily  treatment of patients with gram-positive or gram-negative infections. review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. we reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five gram-positive and 11 gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using  data from the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa. all mic results were interpreted using nccls breakpoint criteria. ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than  in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. beta-lactam-resistant streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group b beta-haemolytic  streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. among methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. ceftriaxone resistance among escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. resistance to ceftriaxone among enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. all haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. in summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered gram-positive and gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.

TI  == epidemiology and microbiology of cellulitis and bacterial soft tissue infection during hiv disease: a 10-year survey.
AB  == background: cellulitis and soft tissue infection are underestimated complications of hiv disease. patients and methods: sixty-seven bacteriologically proven consecutive episodes were identified among 2221 hiv-infected patients hospitalized in a 10-year period, and assessed according to several epidemiological, microbiological and clinical variables. results: staphylococcus  aureus was the most frequently cultured pathogen (50% of 92 isolates), followed by pseudomonas spp., escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes; a polymicrobial infection was present in 38.1% of episodes. drug addiction (p < 0.003) and male gender (p < 0.04) were significantly associated with the occurrence of these complications, which were community-acquired in 83.6% of cases. while a remarkable variation in the severity of underlying immunodeficiency was shown, hematogenous dissemination occurred in 25.4% of episodes, and proved significantly related to a low cd4+ lymphocyte count, and neutropenia. a 21.7% methicillin-resistance rate was shown among s. aureus isolates. all episodes were favorably treated in 5-16 days, in over 60% of cases with associated beta-lactam-aminglycoside antibiotics; a recurrence of staphylococcal cellulitis  occurred in four patients only. conclusion: skin and soft tissue infections are continuing causes of morbidity in hiv-infected patients, even in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era.

AB  == the polc gene from streptococcus pyogenes (s. pyogenes, strain sf370) has been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli (e. coli) as a fusion protein containing an n-terminal histidine tag. the purified recombinant enzyme showed an apparent molecular mass of 160 kda on sds-page and a specific activity of 3.5 nmol/min/mg  when assayed in the presence of calf thymus dna and the four deoxyribonucleoside  triphosphates. this activity was inhibited by tmau, a specific inhibitor of polc. to facilitate kinetic studies, and high-throughput assays, a double-stranded oligo dna primer/template was used as a substrate. the minimum requirement for the length of the substrate was a 20-base oligo primer annealed to a 35-base template. polc activity was detected either by a filter-binding format or by a novel homogeneous scintillation proximity assay (spa). sensitivity to inhibition  by anilinouracil analogs was improved by incorporating three deoxycytidines in the template strand as the first 3 bases to be copied by the polymerase. inhibition of polc activity by trimethyleneanilinouracil by the filtration and spa methods gave comparable results, but the spa assay uses less radioactive label, is less time-consuming, and is amenable to high-throughput formatting.

TI  == nad+-glycohydrolase acts as an intracellular toxin to enhance the extracellular survival of group a streptococci.
AB  == group a streptococci (gas) produce several secreted products that are thought to  enhance pathogenicity by facilitating spread of the organisms through host tissues. two such products, streptolysin o (slo) and nad+-glycohydrolase, appear  to be functionally linked, in that slo is required for transfer of nad+-glycohydrolase into epithelial cells. however, the effects of nad+-glycohydrolase on host cells are largely unexplored. we now report that slo-mediated delivery of nad+-glycohydrolase to the cytoplasm of human keratinocytes results in major changes in host cell biology that enhance gas pathogenicity. we derived isogenic mutant strains deficient in the expression of  slo, nad+-glycohydrolase or both proteins in the background of a virulent, m-type 3 strain of gas. all three mutant strains were internalized by human keratinocytes more rapidly and in higher numbers than were organisms from the wild-type strain. association of the mutant strains with keratinocytes also resulted in reduced cytotoxicity and reduced keratinocyte apoptosis compared with wild-type gas. these results support a model in which nad+-glycohydrolase contributes to gas pathogenesis by modulating host cell signalling pathways to inhibit gas internalization, to augment slo-mediated cytotoxicity and to induce keratinocyte apoptosis. we conclude that nad+-glycohydrolase is a novel type of bacterial toxin that acts intracellularly in the infected host to enhance the survival and proliferation of an extracellular pathogen.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide triggers invasive streptococcal disease in mice through a tumour necrosis factor-alpha-dependent mechanism.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes sometimes induces invasive streptococcal infection, including streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss). muscular necrosis is one of  the peculiar symptoms of invasive streptococcal infection and stss. we inoculated s. pyogenes into the muscles of mice. to do so, 5 x 10(8) bacteria in 0.2 ml phosphate-buffered saline were injected into the right hind thigh. none of the mice injected with the bacteria showed muscular necrosis and none died. tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and infiltration of leucocytes were detected in the muscles of infected sites, although the condition of the infected mice did not deteriorate after anti-tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody treatment. the infected  mice treated intraperitoneally with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) showed augmentation of bacterial growth, muscular necrosis and death. tnf-alpha was detected in the sera of the infected mice treated with lps, but not in the muscles of the infected sites. infiltration of leucocytes into the infected muscle was not observed in the infected mice treated with lps. anti-tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody treatment decreased mortality in the infected mice treated with lps. moreover, the infected mice treated with recombinant tnf-alpha showed augmentation of muscular necrosis and death. these results suggest that systemic  production of tnf-alpha induced by stimulation with lps inhibits infiltration of  leucocytes into the infected site and exacerbates muscular infection, and that tnf-alpha produced in streptococcal infection is not a defence factor for the host. invasive streptococcal infection and stss appear to be induced by both s. pyogenes and the host's immune system.

TI  == in vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  == fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. the trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. we determined the mic and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (tem), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. all gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/l of carboxyfullerene, whereas gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/l carboxyfullerene. bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for gram-positive species, particularly for streptococcus pyogenes a-20, which was killed rapidly. intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by tem and anti-carboxyfullerene  binding assay. damage to the cell membrane in gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. these findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.

TI  == site-directed mutation of conserved cysteine residues does not inactivate the streptococcus pyogenes hyaluronan synthase.
AB  == hyaluronan synthase (has), the enzyme responsible for the production of hyaluronic acid (ha), is a well-conserved membrane-bound protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. this enzyme performs at least six discrete functions  in producing a heterodisaccharide polymer of several million molecular weight and extruding it from the cell. among the conserved motifs and domains within the class i has family are four cysteine residues. cysteines in many proteins are important in establishing and maintaining tertiary structure or in the coordination of catalytic functions. in the present study we utilized a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, chemical labeling, and kinetic analyses to determine the importance of specific cys residues for catalysis and structure  of the ha synthase from streptococcus pyogenes (sphas). the enzyme activity of sphas was partially inhibited by cysteine-reactive chemical reagents such as n-ethylmaleimide. quantitation of the number of cys residues modified by these reagents, using maldi-tof mass spectrometry, demonstrated that there are no stable disulfide bonds in sphas. the six cys residues of sphas were then mutated, individually and in various combinations, to serine or alanine. the single cys-mutants were all kinetically similar to the wild-type enzyme in terms of their v(max) and k(m) values for ha synthesis. the cys-null mutant, in which all  cys residues were mutated to alanine, retained approximately 66% of wild-type activity, demonstrating that despite their high degree of conservation within the has family, cys residues are not absolutely necessary for ha biosynthesis by the  sphas enzyme.

TI  == the streptococcal hyaluronan synthases are inhibited by sulfhydryl-modifying reagents, but conserved cysteine residues are not essential for enzyme function.
AB  == hyaluronan (ha) synthase (has) is a membrane-bound enzyme that utilizes udp-glucuronic acid (glcua) and udp-glcnac to synthesize ha. the has from streptococcus pyogenes (sphas, 419 amino acids) contains six cys residues, whereas the enzyme from streptococcus equisimilis (sehas, 417 amino acids) contains four cys residues. these cys residues of sehas are highly conserved in all class i has family members. here we investigated the structural and functional roles of these conserved cysteines in sehas by using site-directed mutagenesis and sensitivity to sulfhydryl modifying reagents. both sehas and sphas were inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents such as n-ethylmaleimide (nem) and iodoacetamide in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. these inhibition curves were biphasic, indicating the presence of sensitive and insensitive components. after treatment of sehas with nem, the v(max) value was decreased approximately 50%, and the k(m) values changed only slightly. all the cys-to-ala  mutants of sehas were partially active. the least active single (c226a), double (c226a,c262a), or triple (c226a,c262a,c367a) cys mutants retained 24, 3.2, and 1.4% activity, respectively, compared with wild-type enzyme. surprisingly, the v(max) value of the sehas(cys-null) mutant was approximately 17% of wild-type, although the k(m) values for both substrates were increased 3-6-fold. cys residues, therefore, are not involved in a critical interaction necessary for either substrate binding or catalysis. however, the distribution of ha products was shifted to a smaller size in approximately 25% of the sehas cys mutants, particularly the triple mutants. mass spectroscopic analysis of wild-type and cys-null sehas as well as the labeling of all double cys-to-ala mutants with [(14)c]nem demonstrated that sehas contains no disulfide bonds. we conclude that  the four cys residues in sehas are not directly involved in catalysis, but that one or more of these cys residues are located in or near substrate binding or glycosyltransferase active sites, so that their modification hinders the functions of has.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  == xerd belongs to the site specific recombinases of the integrase family of proteins that catalyze recombination events via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. sequence alignments and crystal structure resolution of e. coli xerd and related  enzymes demonstrated the importance of four conserved amino acids r-h-r-h that are spaced along the c-terminal domain in addition to a conserved k and the active site y, all of which have been implicated in catalysis. the deduced amino  acid sequence of the putative s. pneumoniae xerd contained three unique replacements at the conserved positions resulting in l-q-r-l; moreover, the active site y was the penultimate amino acid residue, and the extreme c-terminal  region suggested to be involved in interaction of e. coli xerd with xerc was lacking. severe growth defects in a loss-of-function xerd mutant are consistent with an important in vivo function of the s. pneumoniae xerd protein. highly related xerd genes with similar unusual amino acid replacements were found in s.  mitis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes but not in other gram-positive bacteria, although the genetic environment was very similar in many species. there are at least another four genes in the s. pneumoniae knr_7/87 genome encoding xer related peptides, one of which was identified as the xerc homologue. the xerd and xerc genes were present in a sample of 20 s. pneumoniae strains whereas the other xer genes appear to be absent in some of the strains and are more closely related to integrases of phage and transposon origin.

TI  == endometritis in postparturient cattle associated with bovine herpesvirus-4 infection: 15 cases.
AB  == suppurative, ulcerative endometritis associated with bovine herpesvirus-4 (bhv-4) infection was identified in 15 postparturient dairy cows from 5 separate dairies. characteristic eosinophilic to amphophilic intranuclear viral inclusion bodies were identified within degenerate endometrial lining epithelium and endothelial cells. bovine herpesvirus-4 was confirmed as the etiology by a combination of fluorescent antibody assays, viral isolation, heminested pcr, ultrastructural examination of the uterus and inoculated tissue culture cells, and negative-stain electron microscopy of tissue culture supernatant. viral particles measuring 70-95 nm were demonstrated in uterine epithelial and endothelial cells by electron microscopy. bacteria including arcanobacterium pyogenes, escherichia coli, and an alpha-streptococcus isolate were isolated from all uteri. bovine herpesvirus-4-associated endometritis has been previously reported in sporadic cases in europe but has not been previously reported in the united states. endometritis associated with bhv-4 appears to be an emerging syndrome in georgia  dairy herds.

TI  == a secondary rna polymerase sigma factor from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the important human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes (the group a streptococcus or gas) causes diseases ranging from mild, self-limiting pharyngitis to severe invasive infections. regulation of the expression of gas genes in response to specific environmental differences within the host is probably key in determining the course of the infectious process, however, little is known of global regulators of gene expression in gas. although secondary rna polymerase sigma factors act as global regulators of gene expression in many other bacteria, none  has yet been isolated from the gas. the newly available gas genome sequence indicates that the only candidate secondary sigma factor is encoded by two identical open reading frames (orfs). these orfs encode a protein that is 40% identical to the transcription factor comx, believed to act as an rna polymerase  sigma factor in streptococcus pneumoniae. to test whether the gas comx homologue  functions as a sigma factor, we cloned and purified it from escherichia coli. we  found that in vitro, this gas protein, which we call sigmax, directed core rna polymerase from bacillus subtilis to transcribe from two gas promoters that contain the cin-box region, required for transcription by s. pneumoniae comx in vivo. on the other hand, gas sigmax did not promote transcription of a gas promoter (hasa) expected to be dependent on sigmaa, the housekeeping or primary rna polymerase sigma factor. addition of monoclonal antibody that inhibited sigmaa-directed transcription had no effect on sigmax-directed transcription, showing that the latter was not the result of contaminating sigmaa. transcription of both cin-box-containing promoters initiated downstream of the cin-box and two  different single basepair substitutions in the cin-box of the cina promoter each  caused a severe reduction of sigmax-directed transcription in vitro. thus, the cin-box is required for sigmax-directed transcription.

TI  == an in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. study design: cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical  mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the  cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group b streptococcus and escherichia coli. results: in the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of staphylococcus saprophyticus, e coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and  patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. in the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group b streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/ml of gentamicin and toward e coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/ml of gentamicin. conclusion: a low-molecular substance  with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of traditional australian medicinal plants.
AB  == fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional australian aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four gram-positive (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes) and four gram-negative (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. in a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. b. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. extracts from the leaves of eremophila species (myoporaceae) were the most active, with eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against gram-positive bacteria). the antibacterial effects of  e. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for b. cereus, e. faecalis and s. aureus and 2 h for s. pyogenes.

TI  == in vitro selection of resistance to clindamycin related to alterations in the attenuator of the erm(tr) gene of streptococcus pyogenes ucn1 inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  == a clinical isolate of streptococcus pyogenes ucn1 intermediate to erythromycin (mic 1 mg/l) and susceptible to clindamycin (mic 0.03 mg/l) harboured an inducible erm(tr) gene encoding a ribosomal methylase. we have selected in vitro, in the presence of concentrations of clindamycin ranging from 0.12 to 1 mg/l, one-step mutants that are highly resistant to this antibiotic (mic 64 mg/l) at a  frequency of 10(-7). by contrast, in an erythromycin-susceptible strain of s. pyogenes ucn5, mutants could be selected only by a low concentration of clindamycin (0.12 mg/l) at a frequency of 10(-9). clindamycin resistance in four  of six s. pyogenes ucn1 mutants was associated with deletions of 163 and 6 bp, as well as a tandem duplication of 101 bp in the regulatory sequence of the erm(tr)  gene. the role of these structural alterations in clindamycin resistance was demonstrated by cloning the erm(tr) gene from the wild-type and mutant strains in escherichia coli db10, a mutant susceptible to macrolides. clindamycin resistance was expressed only when the erm(tr) gene was preceded by an altered attenuator. mutations could lead to the formation of mrna secondary structures accounting for the accessibility of the ribosome-binding site and the initiation codon of the ermtr methylase to the ribosomes, and subsequently for the translation of the erm(tr) transcripts. the easy selection in one step of mutants resistant to high  levels of clindamycin by concentrations of this antibiotic ranging from four to 40 times the mic leads us to recommend caution in the use of clindamycin therapy  in group a streptococcus infections.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters for antimicrobial effects of cefotaxime and amoxicillin in an in vitro kinetic model.
AB  == an in vitro kinetic model was used to study the relation between pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) parameters for antimicrobial effect, e.g., the time above mic (t>mic), maximum concentration in serum (c(max)), and area under the concentration-time curve (auc). streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli were  exposed to cefotaxime, and the activity of amoxicillin against four strains of streptococcus pneumoniae with different susceptibilities to penicillin was studied. the drug elimination rate varied so that the t>mic ranged from 20 to 100% during 24 h, while the auc and/or the initial concentration (c(max)) were kept constant. for s. pyogenes and e. coli, the maximal antimicrobial effect (e(max)) at 24 h occurred when the antimicrobial concentration exceeded the mic for 50 and 80% of the strains tested, respectively. the penicillin-susceptible pneumococci (mic, 0.03 mg/liter) and the penicillin-intermediate strain (mic, 0.25 mg/liter) showed maximal killing by amoxicillin at a t>mic of 50%. for a strain for which the mic was 2 mg/liter, c(max) needed to be increased to achieve the e(max). under the condition that c(max) was 10 times the mic, e(max) was obtained at a t>mic of 60%, indicating that c(max), in addition to t>mic, may be  an important parameter for antimicrobial effect on moderately penicillin-resistant pneumococci. for the strain for which the mic was 4 mg/liter, the reduction of bacteria varied from -0.4 to -3.6 log(10) cfu/ml at a  t>mic of 100%, despite an initial antimicrobial concentration of 10 times the mic. our studies have shown that the in vitro kinetic model is a useful complement to animal models for studying the pk-pd relationship for antimicrobial effect of antibiotics.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI  == streptococcal inhibitor of complement (sic) inhibits the membrane attack complex  by preventing uptake of c567 onto cell membranes.
AB  == streptococcal inhibitor of complement (sic) was first described in 1996 as a putative inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of complement (mac). sic is a 31 000 mw protein secreted in large quantities by the virulent streptococcus pyogenes strains m1 and m57, and is encoded by a gene which is extremely variable. in order to study further the interactions of sic with the mac, we have made a recombinant form of sic (rsic) in escherichia coli and purified native m1  sic which was used to raise a polyclonal antibody. sic prevented reactive lysis of guinea pig erythrocytes by the mac at a stage prior to c5b67 complexes binding to cell membranes, presumably by blocking the transiently expressed membrane insertion site on c7. the ability of sic and clusterin (another putative fluid phase complement inhibitor) to inhibit complement lysis was compared, and found to be equally efficient. in parallel, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay both sic and rsic bound strongly to c5b67 and c5b678 complexes and to a lesser extent  c5b-9, but only weakly to individual complement components. the implications of these data for virulence of sic-positive streptococci are discussed, in light of  the fact that gram-positive organisms are already protected against complement lysis by the presence of their peptidoglycan cell walls. we speculate that mac inhibition may not be the sole function of sic.

TI  == the influence of plasma on the disinfecting activity of the new antimicrobial agent n-chlorotaurine-sodium in comparison with chloramine t.
AB  == the phenomenon of increasing bactericidal activity of n-chlorotaurine in the presence of chlorine-consuming material has been investigated both on a chemical-analytical and microbiological basis using plasma as substrate and chloramine t for comparison. chlorine consumption assessed by iodometric titration showed a biphasic time-course with a very fast loss of oxidation capacity within one minute (n-chlorotaurine: -9.3%, chloramine t: -16.8%) followed by a slow loss which could still be detected after 24 h (total loss -61.7% and -74.1%, respectively). killing curves revealed that an increase in bactericidal activity, in spite of improved consumption, did not occur with all strains, and could be detected only at a certain degree of consumption. escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the most pronounced effect, streptococcus pyogenes and proteus mirabilis a medium-sized one, while it was absent in staphylococcus aureus. with chloramine t, an increase in bactericidal activity could not be proved. the chemical basis of these consumption effects can be reduced to four reaction types: oxidation of thiols; chlorine substitution of  activated c-h compounds; transhalogenation; and hydrolytic degradation of n-chloro-alpha-amino acids and -peptides emerging by transhalogenation. the initial fast loss of oxidation capacity can be attributed mainly to oxidation of  thiols, while the subsequent slower decrease is caused by the other types of reaction. the increase in bactericidal activity, on the other hand, can be explained by transhalogenation, leading to the formation of more bactericidal n-chloro compounds by which the loss of n-chlorotaurine is over-compensated.

TI  == mapping the ligand-binding region of borrelia burgdorferi fibronectin-binding protein bbk32.
AB  == the cellular attachment and entry of pathogenic microorganisms can be facilitated by the expression of microbial adhesins that bind fibronectin. we have previously described a borrelia burgdorferi gene, bbk32, that encodes a 47-kda fibronectin-binding protein. in this study, the ligand-binding region of bbk32 from b. burgdorferi isolate b31 was localized to 32 amino acids. the bbk32 gene was cloned and sequenced from three additional b. burgdorferi isolates representing different genospecies of b. burgdorferi sensu lato. all four bbk32 genes encoded proteins having fibronectin-binding activity when expressed in escherichia coli, and the deduced proteins shared 81 to 91% amino acid sequence identity within the ligand-binding domain. in addition, the ligand-binding region of bbk32 was found to share sequence homology with a fibronectin-binding peptide  defined for protein f1 of streptococcus pyogenes. the structural and functional similarity between the ligand-binding region of bbk32 and the ur region of protein f1 suggests a common mechanism of cellular adhesion and entry for b. burgdorferi and s. pyogenes.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of 14 essential oils and their major constituents in the gaseous state was evaluated against haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. for most essential  oils examined, h. influenzae was most susceptible, followed by s. pneumoniae and  s. pyogenes, and then s. aureus. penicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. pneumoniae were comparable in susceptibility. escherichia coli, which was used as a control, showed least susceptibility. a minimal inhibitory dose (mid) was introduced as a measure of the vapour activity. among 14 essential oils, cinnamon bark, lemon-grass and thyme oils showed the lowest mid, followed by essential oils containing terpene alcohols as major constituents. the essential oils containing terpene ketone, ether and, in particular, hydrocarbon had high mids. the vapour activity on short exposure was comparable to that following overnight  exposure, and rapid evaporation was more effective than slow evaporation of essential oils. the vapour concentration and absorption into agar of essential oils reached a maximum 1 or 2 h after rapid evaporation. these results indicate that the antibacterial action of essential oils was most effective when at high vapour concentration for a short time.

AB  == background: approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. the time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. study design and methods: isolates  of bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, corynebacterium species, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus viridans were inoculated into day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 cfu per ml (2 units/organism). each bag was sampled 10 times (20 ml/sample). four ml of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 ml was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 ml into thioglycollate broth. results: with the exception of p. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. a range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. a mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 cfu/ml inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of p. acnes in anaerobic bottles. conclusion: bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 cfu per ml. p. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). however, p. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination.  such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet  storage.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance: steps to reduce the problem with emphasis on antibiotic utilization the rapid city experience.
AB  == in summary, as the shea/idsa joint committee on prevention of antimicrobial resistance suggested, it should be easier to prevent the acquisition of resistance than to respond after the problem is extensive. we have taken that approach in the measures undertaken and outlined above. our lower rates of resistant microorganisms are, in part, due to this, but also due to the diligent  use of antibiotics by the medical staff-largely in avoiding empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy when not needed. our formulary is not restrictive but new antibiotics are not added unless there is a proven niche. the most appropriate and effective antibiotic at our hospital for streptococcus pneumoniae is penicillin, for streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin, for staphylococcus aureus, nafcillin, for a severe escherichia coli infection, gentamicin, and for pseudomonas aeurginosa, gentamicin and ceftazidime. our efforts are to maintain this favorable situation for our patients and clinicians. additionally, we will continue to explore and implement new avenues of prevention, with an emphasis on optimal antibiotic utilization, toward the goal of protecting our patients and health care workers from resistant bacteria.

TI  == evidence for symmetric chromosomal inversions around the replication origin in bacteria.
AB  == background: whole-genome comparisons can provide great insight into many aspects  of biology. until recently, however, comparisons were mainly possible only between distantly related species. complete genome sequences are now becoming available from multiple sets of closely related strains or species. results: by comparing the recently completed genome sequences of vibrio cholerae, streptococcus pneumoniae and mycobacterium tuberculosis to those of closely related species - escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes and mycobacterium leprae, respectively - we have identified an unusual and previously unobserved feature of bacterial genome structure. scatterplots of the conserved sequences (both dna and protein) between each pair of species produce a distinct x-shaped pattern, which we call an x-alignment. the key feature of these alignments is that they have symmetry around the replication origin and terminus; that is, the  distance of a particular conserved feature (dna or protein) from the replication  origin (or terminus) is conserved between closely related pairs of species. statistically significant x-alignments are also found within some genomes, indicating that there is symmetry about the replication origin for paralogous features as well. conclusions: the most likely mechanism of generation of x-alignments involves large chromosomal inversions that reverse the genomic sequence symmetrically around the origin of replication. the finding of these x-alignments between many pairs of species suggests that chromosomal inversions around the origin are a common feature of bacterial genome evolution.

AB  == streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss) is a highly lethal, acute-onset illness that is a subset of invasive streptococcal disease. the majority of clinical stss cases have been associated with the pyrogenic toxin superantigens (ptsags) streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin a or c (spe a or c), although cases have been reported that are not associated with either of these exotoxins. recent genome sequencing projects have revealed a number of open reading frames that potentially encode proteins with similarity to spes a and c and to other ptsags.  here, we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and functional characterization of a novel exotoxin termed streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin j (spe j). purified recombinant spe j (rspe j) expressed from escherichia coli stimulated the expansion of both rabbit splenocytes and human peripheral blood lymphocytes, preferentially expanded human t cells displaying vbeta2, -3, -12, -14, and -17 on their t-cell receptors, and was active at concentrations as low as 5 x 10(-6) microg/ml. furthermore, rspe j induced fevers in rabbits and was lethal in two models of stss. biochemically, spe j had a predicted molecular weight of 24,444 and an isoelectric point of 7.7 and lacked the ability to form the cystine loop structure characteristic of many ptsags. spe j shared 19.6, 47.1, 38.8, 18.1, 19.6, and 24.4% identity with spes a, c, g, and h, streptococcal superantigen, and streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin z-2, respectively, and was immunologically cross-reactive with spe c. the characterization of a seventh functional streptococcal ptsag raises important questions relating to the evolution of the streptococcal superantigens.

AB  == the identification of clones within bacterial populations is often taken as evidence for a low rate of recombination, but the validity of this inference is rarely examined. we have used statistical tests of congruence between gene trees  to examine the extent and significance of recombination in six bacterial pathogens. for neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus, the congruence between the maximum likelihood trees reconstructed using seven house-keeping genes was in most cases  no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology. the lack of congruence between gene trees in these four species, which include both naturally transformable and nontransformable species, is in three cases supported by high ratios of recombination to point mutation during clonal diversification (estimates of this parameter were not possible for strep. pyogenes). in contrast, gene trees constructed for hemophilus influenzae and pathogenic isolates of escherichia coli showed a higher degree of congruence, suggesting lower rates of  recombination. the impact of recombination therefore varies between bacterial species but in many species is sufficient to obliterate the phylogenetic signal in gene trees.

TI  == biochemical characterization of signal peptidase i from gram-positive streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == bacterial signal peptidase i is responsible for proteolytic processing of the precursors of secreted proteins. the enzymes from gram-negative and -positive bacteria are different in structure and specificity. in this study, we have cloned, expressed, and purified the signal peptidase i of gram-positive streptococcus pneumoniae. the precursor of streptokinase, an extracellular protein produced in pathogenic streptococci, was identified as a substrate of s.  pneumoniae signal peptidase i. phospholipids were found to stimulate the enzymatic activity. mutagenetic analysis demonstrated that residues serine 38 and lysine 76 of s. pneumoniae signal peptidase i are critical for enzyme activity and involved in the active site to form a serine-lysine catalytic dyad, which is  similar to lexa-like proteases and escherichia coli signal peptidase i. similar to lexa-like proteases, s. pneumoniae signal peptidase i catalyzes an intermolecular self-cleavage in vitro, and an internal cleavage site has been identified between glycine 36 and histidine 37. sequence analysis revealed that the signal peptidase i and lexa-like proteases show sequence homology around the  active sites and some common properties around the self-cleavage sites. all these data suggest that signal peptidase i and lexa-like proteases are closely related  and belong to a novel class of serine proteases.

TI  == role of serum amyloid p component in bacterial infection: protection of the host  or protection of the pathogen.
AB  == serum amyloid p component (sap) binds to streptococcus pyogenes, and we show here that it also binds to neisseria meningitidis, including a lipopolysaccharide (lps)-negative mutant, and to rough variants of escherichia coli. surprisingly, this binding had a powerful antiopsonic effect both in vitro and in vivo, reducing phagocytosis and killing of bacteria. furthermore, sap knockout mice survived lethal infection with s. pyogenes and rough e. coli j5, organisms to which sap binds. the susceptibility of sap(-/-) mice was fully restored by injection of isolated human sap. however, sap(-/-) mice were more susceptible than wild-type animals to lethal infection with e. coli o111:b4, a smooth strain  to which sap does not bind, suggesting that sap also has some host defense function. although sap binds to lps in vitro, sap(-/-) mice were only marginally  more susceptible to lethal lps challenge, and injection of large amounts of human sap into wild-type mice did not affect sensitivity to lps, indicating that sap is not a significant modulator of lps toxicity in vivo. in contrast, the binding of  sap to pathogenic bacteria enabled them to evade neutrophil phagocytosis and display enhanced virulence. abrogation of this molecular camouflage is thus potentially a novel therapeutic approach, and we show here that administration to wild-type mice of (r)-1-[6-(r)-2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo-hexanoyl]pyrrolidine -2- carboxylic acid, a drug that inhibits sap binding, significantly prolonged survival during lethal infection with e. coli j5.

TI  == a century of the synthesis of dapsone: its anti-infective capacity now and then.
AB  == background: although dapsone was first synthesized in 1908, a quarter of a century was to pass before it was used in the treatment of bacterial infections.  dapsone was, however, too toxic for humans (because of the excess dosage which was administered at that time) and was thus considered to be of no value in the treatment of common bacterial infections. since the early 1950s, dapsone has been recognized as being uniquely effective against a number of noninfectious, inflammatory diseases and, today, this is its main indication. thus, the reason why dapsone was first introduced into medicine, namely the treatment of bacterial infections, has been set aside and its main current applications are the treatment of noninfectious, inflammatory, autoimmune, and bullous diseases. objective: to study the anti-infective capacity of dapsone against common bacterial infections. as many patients who receive dapsone for the treatment of noninfectious, inflammatory diseases have a concomitant bacterial infection or a  superinfection of their skin disease, we thought that, if dapsone proved to be effective against common bacterial infections, it may obviate the need for an additional antimicrobial drug in these patients. methods: three bacterial atcc> strains (streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli) were tested by a macrodilution minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) test for dapsone. dapsone concentrations were between 0.06 and 1125 microg/ml. results: even the highest concentration of dapsone of 1125 microg/ml did not inhibit bacterial growth. conclusions: our results indicate that dapsone has no antibacterial effects whatsoever. even at very high concentrations, it does not suppress the growth of most susceptible strains of bacteria. the story of dapsone (i.e. the long time that elapsed between its synthesis to its use for the chemotherapy of infectious diseases) will not repeat itself this time.

TI  == identification and immunogenicity of group a streptococcus culture supernatant proteins.
AB  == extracellular proteins made by group a streptococcus (gas) play critical roles in the pathogenesis of human infections caused by this bacterium. although many extracellular gas proteins have been identified and characterized, there has been no systematic analysis of culture supernatant proteins. proteins present in the culture supernatant of strains of serotype m1 (mgas 5005) and m3 (mgas 315) mutants lacking production of the major extracellular cysteine protease were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by amino-terminal amino acid sequencing and interrogation of available databases, including a serotype m1 genome sequence. in the aggregate, amino-terminal amino acid sequence data for 66 protein spots were generated, 53 unique sequences were obtained, and  44 distinct proteins were identified. sixteen of the 44 proteins had apparent secretion signal sequences and 27 proteins did not. eight of the 16 proteins with apparent secretion signal sequences have not been previously described for gas. antibodies against most of the apparently secreted proteins were present in sera  from mice infected subcutaneously with mgas 5005 or mgas 315. humans with documented gas infections (pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever, and severe invasive disease) also had serum antibodies reacting with many of the apparently  secreted proteins, indicating that they were synthesized in the course of gas-human interaction. the genes encoding four of the eight previously undescribed and apparently secreted culture supernatant proteins were cloned, and the proteins were overexpressed in escherichia coli. western blot analysis with these recombinant proteins and sera from gas-infected mice and humans confirmed the immunogenicity of these proteins. taken together, the data provide new information about the molecular aspects of gas-host interactions.

AB  == background: infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. knowledge of their occurrence  and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. we performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. objective: to delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. methods: children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. results: seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (tbsa), burn 15%]. twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis,  6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13  involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia,  2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by cdc criteria no organism was recovered. organisms causing infection were: staphylococcus aureus, 19; candida albicans, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative staphylococcus, 4; enterococcus sp., 3; escherichia coli, 1; klebsiella oxytoca,  1; serratia marcescens, 1; streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; streptococcus pyogenes, 1; aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and candida parapsilosis, 1. burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (tbsa >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors  for infection; young age and site of burn were not. conclusion: the most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. children with flame and inhalation injury, tbsa burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.

TI  == characterization of opua, a glycine-betaine uptake system of lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a lactococcus lactis glycine-betaine transport system was identified by functional complementation of an escherichia coli prop prou mutant with a gene library from l. lactis sbsp. cremoris. the cloned locus forms an operon highly homologous to opua, encoding a glycine-betaine uptake system of bacillus subtilis. disruption of opua in l. lactis abolished protection by glycine-betaine against elevated osmolarity. opua belongs to the so-called "abc transporters" family, which comprise an extracellularly localized substrate-binding protein. in b. subtilis opua system, this binding protein is a lipoprotein, attached to the external face of the cytoplasmic membrane by its lipidic moiety. in contrast, in  the l. lactis opua operon, and in other gram-positive homologues as well, a fusion between the gene encoding the integral membrane protein and the substrate-binding protein components gave rise to a hybrid protein presumably attaching the substrate-binding protein to the surface of the cell via its covalent link to the integral membrane component. mapping of l. lactis opua transcription start identified one mrna, more abundant in cells grown at elevated osmolarity. construction of an opua-gusa fusion confirmed that opua transcription is directed by a promoter osmotically inducible in l. lactis. when recombined upstream from a lac transcriptional fusion in the chromosome of e. coli, the opua promoter appeared as very strong, and only poorly stimulated by elevated osmotic  pressure, suggesting the existence of a specific machinery involved in the osmotic signal transduction in l. lactis.

TI  == the dna replication machine of a gram-positive organism.
AB  == this report outlines the protein requirements and subunit organization of the dna replication apparatus of streptococcus pyogenes, a gram-positive organism. five proteins coordinate their actions to achieve rapid and processive dna synthesis.  these proteins are: the polc dna polymerase, tau, delta, delta', and beta. s. pyogenes dnax encodes only the full-length tau, unlike the escherichia coli system in which dnax encodes two proteins, tau and gamma. the s. pyogenes tau binds polc, but the interaction is not as firm as the corresponding interaction in e. coli, underlying the inability to purify a polc holoenzyme from gram-positive cells. the tau also binds the delta and delta' subunits to form a taudeltadelta' "clamp loader." polc can assemble with taudeltadelta' to form a polc.taudeltadelta' complex. after polc.taudeltadelta' clamps beta to a primed site, it extends dna 700 nucleotides/second in a highly processive fashion. gram-positive cells contain a second dna polymerase, encoded by dnae, that has homology to the e. coli alpha subunit of e. coli dna polymerase iii. we show here that the s. pyogenes dnae polymerase also functions with the beta clamp.

AB  == gemifloxacin (sb-265805) is a potent, novel fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this study, the efficacy of gemifloxacin was studied in experimental models of gram-negative pyelonephritis (caused by escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis) and gram-positive wound infection resulting from streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis or staphylococcus aureus. gemifloxacin activity against these pathogens was compared with those of amoxycillin-clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, azithromycin, trovafloxacin,  grepafloxacin, levofloxacin and tosufloxacin. oral treatment was initiated 1 h after infection and continued once or twice daily for 3 days. around 17 h after the end of treatment, animals were killed and the infected kidneys or the skin around the wound site were excised for the enumeration of viable bacteria. in the pyelonephritis model (either microorganism), gemifloxacin reduced bacterial numbers significantly (p < 0.01) compared with no treatment. no comparator agent  had a greater effect than gemifloxacin. notably, grepafloxacin and azithromycin were significantly less effective (p < 0.01) than gemifloxacin against e. coli pyelonephritis, and amoxycillin-clavulanate, azithromycin and trovafloxacin were  inferior (p < 0.01) against p. mirabilis infection. in the s. pyogenes wound infection model, gemifloxacin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, cefuroxime and azithromycin reduced bacterial numbers significantly compared with controls (p <  0.01). results for the comparator quinolones were not significantly different from untreated controls (p > 0.05). gemifloxacin was also effective against staphylococcal infection, as were grepafloxacin and levofloxacin, while ciprofloxacin, trovafloxacin and tosufloxacin were significantly less effective against these pathogens than gemifloxacin (p < 0.01). no comparator agent had greater activity than gemifloxacin against s. pyogenes or s. aureus infections. these data demonstrate the potential benefit of gemifloxacin in the treatment of  gram-negative urinary tract infection and gram-positive skin and soft tissue infection.

TI  == beta 2 integrins are involved in cytokine responses to whole gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == proinflammatory cytokines have an important pathophysiologic role in septic shock. cd14 is involved in cytokine responses to a number of purified bacterial products, including lps. however, little is known of monocyte receptors involved  in cytokine responses to whole bacteria. to identify these receptors, human monocytes were pretreated with different mabs and tnf-alpha was measured in culture supernatants after stimulation with whole heat-killed bacteria. human serum and anti-cd14 abs significantly increased and decreased, respectively, tnf-alpha responses to the gram-negative escherichia coli. however, neither treatment influenced responses to any of the gram-positive bacteria tested, including group a and b streptococci, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus  aureus. complement receptor type iii (cr3 or cd18/cd11b) abs prevented tnf-alpha  release induced by heat-killed group a or b streptococci. in contrast, the same abs had no effects when monocytes were stimulated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus. using either of the latter bacteria, significant inhibition of tnf-alpha  release was produced by abs to cd11c, one of the subunits of cr4. to confirm these blocking ab data, il-6 release was measured in cr3-, cr4-, or cd14-transfected chinese hamster ovary cells after bacterial stimulation. accordingly, streptococci triggered moderate il-6 production (p < 0.05) in cr3 but not cd14 or cr4 transfectants. in contrast, l. monocytogenes and s. aureus induced il-6 release in cr4 but not cr3 or cd14 transfectants. collectively our data indicate that beta 2 integrins, such as cr3 and cr4, may be involved in cytokine responses to gram-positive bacteria. moreover, cd14 may play a more important role in responses to whole gram-negative bacteria relative to gram-positive ones.

AB  == to search for bacterial dna sequences in cholesterol gallstones with negative bacterial culture. we used nested primers polymerase chain reaction (np-pcr) technique to amplify bacterial gene fragments were amplified in vitro from dna extracted from cholesterol gallstones. comparative 16s ribosomal rna sequence analysis was used for elucidation of bacterial identification. the gallbladder gallstones of 30 patients were analyzed. bacterial dna was found in the stones of 26 patients. there was no difference either in cholesterol and water content or in harboring bacterial dna of gallstones. e. coli-related dna fragments were found in the stones of 8 patients (26.67%). propionibacteria type dna was found in the stones of 7 patients (23.33%). stones of 2 patients (6.67%) harbored bacterial gene fragments with similarity of streptococcus pyogenes. a more heterogeneous sequence collection was found in 7 patients (23.33%) and could be assigned to the multiple bacterial infections. another stones of 2 patients (6.67%) had bacterial dna with lower molecularweight which might be related to some unidentified bacteria. the results suggested that most cholesterol gallstones harbor bacterial dna. it is important to determine whether these microorganisms are innocent bystanders or active participants in cholesterol gallstone formation.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

TI  == histopathological study of experimental poststreptococcal pneumonia in mice. group a, type 50, streptococcal infection of murine nares controls with staphylococcus aureus and e. coli.
AB  == microscopic methods (light and electron microscopy, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry) have been used to assess previously unknown pulmonary inflammatory responses of specific pathogen-free (spf) mice secondary to infection via the nares by group a, type 50, streptococci suspended in saline ("strep group mice"). as controls for the strep group mice, the animals were either injected with saline alone via nares (no lesions were seen), or with staphylococcus aureus in saline ("staph group mice") or with e. coli ("e. coli group mice"). the three different bacterial species caused clearly different histological changes in the lung. in the strep group mice, the microscopic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia of bronchiolovascular bundles, secondary to exaggerated pulmonary recirculation of lymphocytes, concomitant with vasoconstrictive angiopathy of encased pulmonary artery branches and nodular inflammatory cell aggregates in lung parenchyma. these aggregates either consisted predominantly of lymphocytes, or of mixed cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages) or of activated macrophages only. in 18 of 22 inflamed lungs of strep group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. in staph group mice the microscopic findings are consistent with the diagnosis of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia of bronchiolovascular bundles, secondary to exaggerated pulmonary recirculation of lymphocytes only. in 12 of 17 inflamed lungs of staph group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. in e. coli group mice the microscopic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of distal terminal bronchiolitis and early pleural-based pneumonitis, in which lymphocytes and neutrophils mingled with macrophages. in 10 of 11 inflamed lungs of e. coli group mice, no bacteria could be cultured from lung tissue. the morphologic approaches described here may have potential for unravelling the complex inflammatory processes underlying different forms of interstitial and parenchymal pneumonia.

TI  == cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of and host defence against microbial infection.
AB  == eukaryotic cell adhesion molecules (cams) are used by various cells and extracellular molecules in host defence against infection. they are involved in many processes including recognition by circulating phagocytes of a site of inflammation, transmigration through the endothelial barrier, diapedesis through  basement membrane and extracellular matrix, and release of effector mechanisms at the infected site. cams involved in leucocyte-endothelial cell interaction include the selectins, integrins, and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.  however, cams are also used by various microorganisms (protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses) during their pathogenesis. for example, bacteria that utilise cams include mycobacterium tuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia spp, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, shigella spp, neisseria spp, bordetella spp, and borrelia burgdorferi. in addition, cams are involved in the pathogenetic effects of the rtx toxins of pasteurella haemolytica, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and the superantigen exotoxins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. a recurrent and topical theme of potential importance within the bacterial group is the intimate relation between cams, bacterial protein receptors, and type iii secretion systems. for example, the ipabcd protein complex is secreted by the type iii system of shigella flexneri and interacts with alpha 5 beta 1 integrin on the eukaryotic cell surface, followed by rho mediated internalisation; this illustrates the relevance of cellular microbiology. cams might prove to be novel therapeutic targets. comparative genomics has provided the knowledge of shared virulence determinants among diverse bacterial genera, and will continue to deepen our understanding of microbial pathogenesis, particularly in the context of the interaction of prokaryotic and eukaryotic molecules.

TI  == effects of the hinge region of cecropin a(1-8)-magainin 2(1-12), a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, on liposomes, bacterial and tumor cells.
AB  == a 20-residue hybrid peptide (ca(1-8)-ma(1-12): kwklfkkigigkflhsakkf-nh(2)) incorporating 1-8 residues of cecropin a (ca) and 1-12 residues of magainin 2 (ma) has potent antibiotic activity without hemolytic activity. in order to investigate the effects of the flexible hinge sequence, gly-ile-gly of ca(1-8)-ma(1-12) (ca-ma) on antibiotic activity, ca-ma and its three analogues, ca-ma1, ca-ma2 and ca-ma3 were synthesized. the gly-ile-gly sequence of ca-ma was deleted in ca-ma1 and replaced with pro and gly-pro-gly in ca-ma2 and ca-ma3, respectively. ca-ma1 and ca-ma3 caused a significant decrease in the bactericidal rate against escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the tumoricidal activity  against four different tumor cells, and the pc/ps (4:1, w/w) vesicle-aggregating  and disrupting activities. however, ca-ma2 showed a similar bactericidal rate and antitumor, vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities, as compared with ca-ma. these results suggested that the flexibility or beta-turn induced by gly-ile-gly  or pro in the central part of ca-ma may be important in the electrostatic interaction of the cationic short alpha-helical region in the n-terminus with the cell membrane surface and the hydrophobic interaction of amphipathic alpha-helical region in the c-terminus with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the cell membrane. ca-ma3 exhibited lower activity in antibacterial, antitumor, and vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities than ca-ma and ca-ma2. this result  suggested that the excessive beta-turn structure by gly-pro-gly in ca-ma3 seems to interrupt the ion channel/pore formation on the lipid bilayer. it was concluded that the appropriate flexibility or beta-turn structure provided by the central hinge is responsible for the effective antibiotic activity of the antimicrobial peptides with the helix-hinge-helix structure.

TI  == outcome of clinical mastitis in dairy heifers assessed by reexamination of cases  one month after treatment.
AB  == heifers that were treated for clinical mastitis prior to parturition or within 14 d postpartum were reexamined approximately 1 mo after treatment. clinical examination of the heifers and microbiological examination of quarter milk samples were carried out on both occasions. of the 1000 heifers included in the study, 10.9% were culled within 28 d after treatment. udder damage caused by mastitis was the only or main reason for culling in 96% of those heifers. in comparison, 4.5% of nonmastitic heifers from the same herds were culled within 30 d postpartum. twenty-five percent of those heifers that were not culled at d 28 after treatment had at least one nonfunctional quarter at that time. one thousand one hundred twenty-two quarters that were clinically affected at the time of treatment were reexamined; 22% were nonfunctional, 14% were still affected by clinical mastitis, 12% had subclinical mastitis, 5% had a latent infection with coagulase-positive staphylococci or streptococcus dysgalactiae, and 46% were bacteriologically negative and had a normal cell count at the time of reexamination. high percentages of nonfunctional quarters were observed among those quarters that were infected with arcanobacterium pyogenes or with coagulase-positive staphylococci at treatment. when all quarters that were clinically affected at treatment were considered, 40% of quarters were cured and  were still in lactation at reexamination. quarters infected with coagulase-negative staphylococci had a higher cure rate than quarters infected with other organisms. at reexamination, clinical signs of thelitis were observed  in many of those quarters that were nonfunctional following the episode of clinical mastitis and also in 25% of lactating quarters in which clinical mastitis persisted.

TI  == the virr response regulator from clostridium perfringens binds independently to two imperfect direct repeats located upstream of the pfoa promoter.
AB  == regulation of toxin production in the gram-positive anaerobe clostridium perfringens occurs at the level of transcription and involves a two-component signal transduction system. the sensor histidine kinase is encoded by the virs gene, while its cognate response regulator is encoded by the virr gene. we have constructed a virr expression plasmid in escherichia coli and purified the resultant his-tagged virr protein. gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that virr binds to the region upstream of the pfoa gene, which encodes perfringolysin  o, but not to regions located upstream of the virr-regulated plc, cola, and pfor  genes, which encode alpha-toxin, collagenase, and a putative pfoa regulator, respectively. the virr binding site was shown by dnase i footprinting to be a 52-bp core sequence situated immediately upstream of the pfoa promoter. when this region was deleted, virr was no longer able to bind to the pfoa promoter. the binding site was further localized to two imperfect direct repeats (cccagttntncac) by site-directed mutagenesis. binding and protection analysis of  these mutants indicated that virr had the ability to bind independently to the two repeated sequences. based on these observations it is postulated that the virr positively regulates the synthesis of perfringolysin o by binding directly to a region located immediately upstream of the pfoa promoter and activating transcription.

TI  == streptococcal histone induces murine macrophages to produce interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  == the histone-like protein (hlpa) is highly conserved among streptococci. after lysis of streptococci in infected tissues, hlpa can enter the bloodstream and bind to proteoglycans in the glomerular capillaries of kidneys, where it can react with antibodies or stimulate host cell receptors. deposits of streptococcal antigens in tissues have been associated with localized acute inflammation. in this study, we measured the ability of purified hlpa (5 to 100 microg/ml), from streptococcus mitis, to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines by cultured, murine peritoneal macrophages. the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-1 (il-1) was time and concentration dependent and was not diminished by the presence of polymyxin b. exposure of macrophages to a mixture of hlpa and lipoteichoic acid resulted in a synergistic response in the production of both tnf-alpha and il-1. stimulation with a mixture of hlpa and heparin resulted in reduced cytokine production (50% less il-1 and 76% less tnf-alpha) compared to that by cells incubated with hlpa alone. the inclusion of  antibodies specific to hlpa in macrophage cultures during stimulation with hlpa did not affect the quantity of tnf-alpha or il-1 produced. these observations suggest that streptococcal histone may contribute to tissue injury at infection sites by promoting monocytes/macrophages to synthesize and release cytokines that initiate and exacerbate inflammation. streptococcus pyogenes, which can infect tissues in enormous numbers, may release sufficient amounts of hlpa to reach the  kidneys and cause acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.

TI  == bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in very young filipino infants.
AB  == objective: pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections are leading causes  of death in developing countries. as part of a multicenter study we aimed to determine the etiology of pneumonia, meningitis and other serious infections in a cohort of filipino infants ages 90 days or younger. method: during a 2-year period, 2053 infants age 90 days or younger presenting to 1 of 3 manila community hospitals were screened; 873 had signs or symptoms suggestive of an infectious illness, and 608 were judged to have clinical features suggestive of severe infection and had laboratory workup including blood for culture and white blood cell count, nasopharyngeal aspirate for virology, cerebrospinal fluid culture when indicated and chest radiograph. chest radiographs were read independently by 3 radiologists without knowledge of clinical findings. results: of the 873 enrolled infants, 81 died (91%). after exclusion of presumed contaminants, positive bacterial culture from blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid was obtained in  35 infants (5.8%; 95% confidence interval 4%, 8%), 9 of whom died. the organisms  responsible for meningitis were acinetobacter spp. (4), streptococcus pneumoniae  (2), escherichia coli (2), enterobacter spp. (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), haemophilus influenzae (1) and staphylococcus aureus (1); those responsible for the other clinical diagnoses were salmonella spp. (6), enterobacter spp. (3), streptococcus pyogenes (3), other gram-negative organisms (8), s. pneumoniae (1)  and staphylococcus aureus (2). in 685 infants examined for viral causes of their  illness, 223 viruses were isolated from 219 infants (32%; 95% confidence interval 28%, 36%). enteroviruses were the most common potential pathogens identified (22% of infants studied), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (17%), rhinovirus (10%) and adenovirus (4%). concomitant virus identification occurred in 10 of those with positive bacterial culture (29%; 95% confidence interval, 15%, 46%), with enterovirus being found in 7 of these cases. conclusion: many young filipino infants with life-threatening illness were evaluated in this study. thirty-five had infections attributable to bacteria, with salmonella spp. being the most common, followed by gram-negative organisms. pneumococcus was an unusual cause.

TI  == etiology of serious infections in young gambian infants.
AB  == background: despite improvements in infant mortality rates in many developing countries including the gambia, neonatal mortality remains high and many neonatal deaths are caused by infection. the study described in this paper was conducted to determine the bacterial and viral etiology of serious infections in gambian infants younger than 91 days old. methods: at a first level health facility 497 infants with symptoms that could indicate serious infection were enrolled, of whom 239 with 1 or more signs of serious infection and 55 with no signs were investigated, yielding 17 cases with positive bacterial cultures of blood and/or  cerebrospinal fluid. at a nearby pediatric referral hospital 198 infants were seen and 182 were investigated, yielding 35 positive bacterial cultures. results: there were 15 culture positive cases of meningitis caused by streptococcus pneumoniae (7), streptococcus pyogenes (2), enterobacter cloacae (2), escherichia coli (1), haemophilus influenzae type b (1), streptococcus agalactiae (1) and salmonella spp. (1). six of these children died. thirty-three infants without meningitis had positive blood cultures for staphylococcus aureus (17), s. pneumoniae (3), salmonella spp. (5), e. coli (3), other enterobacteria (4) and s. agalactiae (1), of whom 14 died. nasopharyngeal aspirates from 438 children were  investigated for common respiratory viruses. respiratory syncytial virus was found in 51, influenza a in 46, influenza b in 22, parainfluenza in 26 and adenovirus in 16. respiratory syncytial virus and influenza a isolates were found most frequently toward the end of the wet season. nasopharyngeal carriage of s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae was studied in 320 infants recruited during the first year. of these 184 (58%) were positive for s. pneumoniae and 141 (44%) were positive for h. influenzae, 18 of which were type b. infants with a bacterial isolate from blood or cerebrospinal fluid were more likely than the rest to die,  whereas those with a viral isolate were less likely to die. conclusions: the most important causes of serious infections in young gambian infants are staphylococcus aureus, s. pneumoniae and salmonella spp.

AB  == the in vitro activity of fk041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with  those of cefdinir (cfdn) and cefditoren (cdtr). fk041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk041 was active against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms  except enterococcus faecalis with mic90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. fk041 was more active than cfdn and cdtr against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to cfdn and cdtr against streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. fk041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae with an mic range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to cfdn but inferior to cdtr. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative organisms such as neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, fk041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of cfdn and cdtr. however, it was inferior to cdtr in activity against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, morganella morganii, and serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. with fk041 a small difference between mic and mbc against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. fk041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. the stability of fk041 to these enzymes was similar to those of cfdn and cdtr. fk041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of s. aureus (pbp 3, 2, and 1) and e. coli (pbp 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).

TI  == characterization of enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase and use in identifying streptococcus agalactiae secreted proteins.
AB  == we have identified and characterized an enterococcus faecalis alkaline phosphatase (ap, encoded by phoz). the predicted gene product shows homology with alkaline phosphatases from a variety of species; it has especially high similarity with two alkaline phosphatases from bacillus subtilis. expression of phoz in escherichia coli, e. faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), or streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) produces a blue-colony phenotype on plates containing a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (xp or bcip). two tests were made to determine if the activity of the enzyme is dependent upon the enzyme's subcellular location. first, elimination of the signal sequence reduced ap activity to 3% of the wild-type activity (or less) in three species of gram-positive bacteria. restoration of export, using the signal sequence from c5a peptidase, restored ap activity to at least 50% of that of the wild type. second, we engineered two chimeric proteins in which ap was fused to either a periplasmic domain or a cytoplasmic domain of lactose permease (a membrane protein). in e. coli, the periplasmic fusion had 17-fold-higher ap activity than the cytoplasmic  fusion. we concluded that ap activity is export dependent. the signal sequence deletion mutant, phozdeltass, was used to identify random genomic fragments from  gbs that encode exported proteins or integral membrane proteins. included in this set of fragments were genes that exhibited homology with the rib protein (a cell  wall protein from gbs) or with dppb (an integral membrane protein from gas). ap acts as a reporter enzyme in gbs, gas, and e. faecalis and is expected to be useful in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == identification, cloning, and expression of the camp factor gene (cfa) of group a  streptococci.
AB  == the camp reaction is a synergistic lysis of erythrocytes by the interaction of an extracellular protein (camp factor) produced by some streptococcal species with the staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase c (beta-toxin). group a streptococci (gas [streptococcus pyogenes]) have been long considered camp negative, and this  reaction commonly has been used to distinguish gas from streptococcus agalactiae. we here provide evidence that gas possess this gene and produce an extracellular  camp factor capable of participating in a positive camp reaction. the s. pyogenes camp factor is specified by a 774-bp open reading frame homologous to the camp factor genes from s. agalactiae and streptococcus uberis. this gene, designated cfa, was isolated on a 1,256-bp fragment and cloned in escherichia coli. recombinant clones of e. coli expressing cfa secreted an active camp factor. the  deduced 28.5-kda protein encoded by cfa consists of 257 amino acids, with a predicted 28-amino-acid signal peptide. the cfa gene is widely spread among gas:  82 of 100 clinical gas isolates produced a positive camp reaction. of the camp-negative strains, 17 of the 18 gas strains contained the cfa gene. additionally, camp activity was detected in streptococci from serogroups c, m, p, r, and u. the cfa gene was cloned and actively expressed in escherichia coli and  gene fusions were made, placing the beta-galactosidase gene (lacz) under control  of the cfa promoter. these cfa promoter-lacz fusions were introduced into s. pyogenes via a bacteriophage-derived site-specific integration vector where they  showed that the cfa gene has a strong promoter that may be subject to as-yet-unidentified regulatory factors. the results presented here, along with previous reports, indicate that the camp factor gene is fairly widespread among streptococci, being present at least in groups a, b, c, g, m, p, r, and u.

AB  == a case of acute appendicitis complicated with necrotizing soft tissue infections  (nstis) in an extremely elderly woman (98 years-old) is reported. she was admitted to our hospital with a history of increasing pain localized in the right lower abdomen. abdominal ultrasonography revealed appendicolithiasis and periappendiceal fluid. an appendectomy and closure of the perforated cecum was performed. on the 5th post-operative day, the patient developed skin erythemas and crepitation in the right lower quadrant. an exploration and drainage of the recent operative incision was performed under the diagnosis of nstis. despite the declining overall incidence of appendicitis, it has been increasing among the elderly. the elderly patients are associated with underlying defects in immune function. nstis, which are characterized by rapidly progressing inflammation and  necrosis of soft tissue, comprise a spectrum of disease ranging from necrosis of  the skin to life-threatening infections. the most common etiology of nstis was post-operative infections of the abdominal wall, which primarily occurred after operations with extensive fecal contamination. nstis are no longer a rare post-operative complication in the elderly and initial treatment should be selected according to the condition of the patient.

AB  == ljc 11,036 is the active metabolite of l-084, a novel oral carbapenem that exhibits potent broad-spectrum activity. antibacterial activities of ljc 11,036 against clinical isolates from respiratory infections, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 52), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 19), haemophilus influenzae (n = 50), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 53), and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 53), and from urinary-tract infections, such as escherichia coli (n = 53) (mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [mic(90)s], 0.1, </=0.006, 0.39, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively), were 2- to 64-fold higher than those of imipenem, cefdinir, and faropenem. moreover, against these bacterial species, except for h. influenzae, the mic(90)s of ljc 11,036 were 4- to 512-fold lower than those of levofloxacin. ljc 11,036 showed bactericidal activity equal or superior to that of imipenem. bactericidal activity against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) did not vary with the phase of growth. ljc 11,036 had potent activity against various beta-lactamase-producing strains, excluding carbapenemase producers. against renal dehydropeptidase-i, ljc 11,036 was more stable than imipenem. furthermore, ljc 11,036 produced in vitro postantibiotic sub-mic effects against prsp hsc-3 (6.0 h at one-fourth the mic) and h. influenzae lj5 (9.2 h at one-half the mic). ljc 11,036 showed high binding affinities for pbp1a, -1b, -2a/2x, -2b, and -3 of prsp and for pbp1b, -2, -3a, and -3b of h. influenzae.

TI  == detection of antimicrobial activity in urine for epidemiologic studies of antibiotic use.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is the inevitable consequence of the selective pressure of  antimicrobial drug use and the adaptive plasticity of the microorganisms. excessive and irrational use of antimicrobial drugs is a problem in all countries. it is particularly troublesome in developing countries where there is  a heavy burden of infectious diseases. this study was designed to determine whether detection of antimicrobial activity in the urine might be a useful tool for epidemiologic studies of the interaction between antibiotic use and resistance in developing countries. a laboratory marker is necessary because the  history of antimicrobial drug use may be unreliable. serial specimens or spontaneously voided urine were obtained from healthy volunteers given a single oral dose of commonly used antimicrobial drugs. urine was also obtained from hospitalized patients the morning after the last dose of an antimicrobial drug and from untreated controls. assays were performed with standard american type culture collection (rockville, md) stains of bacillus stearothermophilus, escherichia coli, and streptococcus pyogenes. antimicrobial activity could not be detected in pretreatment urine. after a single oral dose, the beta lactam antibiotics and erythromycin could be detected for about 12 to 24 hours, whereas  clindamycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin could be detected for 48 or more hours. in hospitalized patients, receiving multiple drugs, the following were the sensitivity and specificity for detection of antimicrobial activity: for b. stearothermophilus, 100.0% and 85.9%, respectively; for s. pyogenes, 94.9% and 94.9%, respectively; and for e. coli, 71.8% and 98.7%, respectively. the combination of e. coli and streptococcus pyogenes exhibited a sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 94.9%. detection of  antimicrobial activity in urine is a promising method to determine antimicrobial  drug use in epidemiologic studies, particularly in populations in which drug use  history is unreliable.

TI  == imp dehydrogenase: mechanism of action and inhibition.
AB  == inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh) catalyzes the conversion of imp to xmp with the concomitant reduction of nad to nadh. this reaction is the rate-limiting step in guanine nucleotide biosynthesis. impdh is a proven target for immunosuppressive, anticancer and antiviral chemotherapy, and may also be a target for antimicrobial agents. impdh is activated by monovalent cations, and one monovalent cation binding site appears to have been identified. the mechanism of impdh involves formation and hydrolysis of a covalent enzyme intermediate (e-xmp*) in a reaction reminiscent of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. substrates bind to impdh in a random order, hydride transfer is fast and nadh release precedes hydrolysis of e-xmp*. the hydrolysis of e-xmp* is at least partially rate-limiting. two inhibitors, mizoribine-monophosphate and a fat base  nucleotide appear to act as transition state analogs. in contrast, mpa inhibits by sequestering e-xmp.

TI  == differential signatures of bacterial and mammalian imp dehydrogenase enzymes.
AB  == imp dehydrogenase (impdh) is an essential enzyme of de novo guanine nucleotide synthesis. impdh inhibitors have clinical utility as antiviral, anticancer or immunosuppressive agents. the essential nature of this enzyme suggests its therapeutic applications may be extended to the development of antimicrobial agents. bacterial impdh enzymes show biochemical and kinetic characteristics that are different than the mammalian impdh enzymes, suggesting impdh may be an attractive target for the development of antimicrobial agents. we suggest that the biochemical and kinetic differences between bacterial and mammalian enzymes are a consequence of the variance of specific, identifiable amino acid residues.  identification of these residues or combination of residues that impart this mammalian or bacterial enzyme signature is a prerequisite for the rational identification of agents that specifically target the bacterial enzyme. we used sequence alignments of impdh proteins to identify sequence signatures associated  with bacterial or eukaryotic impdh enzymes. these selections were further refined to discern those likely to have a role in catalysis using information derived from the bacterial and mammalian impdh crystal structures and site-specific mutagenesis. candidate bacterial sequence signatures identified by this process include regions involved in subunit interactions, the active site flap and the nad binding region. analysis of sequence alignments in these regions indicates a  pattern of catalytic residues conserved in all enzymes and a secondary pattern of amino acid conservation associated with the major phylogenetic groups. elucidation of the basis for this mammalian/bacterial impdh signature will provide insight into the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme and the foundation for the development of highly specific inhibitors.

TI  == bactericidal properties of moxifloxacin and post-antibiotic effect.
AB  == the time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (pae) of moxifloxacin were studied for strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. moxifloxacin  had a bactericidal effect against all strains tested, with the least rapid bactericidal effect being against s. pyogenes and the most rapid effect against s. aureus and e. coli. the pae of moxifloxacin was similar to that of other fluoroquinolones and increased with increasing concentration. no association was  found between the bactericidal effect of moxifloxacin and the duration of pae. gram-positive and gram-negative organisms were also exposed to concentrations of  moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin that simulated the drug concentrations obtained in human serum after standard oral dosing schedules. simulation of moxifloxacin concentrations in human serum reduced viable counts more effectively and more rapidly than shown in time-kill experiments; in contrast, sparfloxacin and amoxycillin were less effective than when constant concentrations of these antibacterials were used.

TI  == ankylosing spondylitis in monozygotic twins: studies on immunological parameters.
AB  == objective: to examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (as). methods:  11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with as, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. the peripheral t cell receptor vbeta repertoire was investigated using facs analysis and 14 different vbeta antibodies. in addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, candida albicans, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli. peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma elispot assays. results: twins suffering from as showed cellular hyporeactivity against k pneumoniae, s pyogenes, c albicans in the elispot assays compared with healthy twins. in contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, as concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their vbeta repertoire on cd4+ and cd8+ lymphocytes. conclusions:  cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective t cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. there are probably other environmental factors that influence  disease concordance.

AB  == aim: this study was undertaken to determine the antimicrobial effect of various endodontic irrigants against six selected microorganisms. methodology: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, str. pyogenes, escherichia coli and candida albicans were included in the study. pre-sterilized whatman paper discs, 6 mm in diameter and soaked with the test solution, were prepared and placed onto the previously seeded agar petri plates.  each plate was incubated aerobically. a zone of inhibition was recorded for each  plate and the results were analysed statistically. results: 5.25% naocl was effective against all test microorganisms with a substantial zone of inhibition.  saline was always ineffective. decreased concentration of naocl significantly reduced its antimicrobial effect. cresophene showed a significantly larger (p < 0.05) average zone of inhibition compared to the other experimental irrigants. alcohol had smaller but not significantly different zones of inhibition than chlorhexidine. conclusions: 5.25% naocl was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with other irrigants used. a reduced concentration of naocl (0.5%) resulted in significantly decreased antimicrobial effects. when compared with 21% alcohol, 0.5% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, paramonochlorophenol (cresophene) showed a greater antimicrobial effect.

TI  == a response regulator that represses transcription of several virulence operons in the group a streptococcus.
AB  == a search for homologs of the bacillus subtilis phop response regulator in the group a streptococcus (gas) genome revealed three good candidates. inactivation of one of these, recently identified as csrr (j. c. levin and m. r. wessels, mol. microbiol. 30:209-219, 1998), caused the strain to produce mucoid colonies and to increase transcription of hasa, the first gene in the operon for capsule synthesis. we report here that a nonpolar insertion in this gene also increased transcription of ska (encoding streptokinase), saga (streptolysin s), and spemf (mitogenic factor) but did not affect transcription of slo (streptolysin o), mga  (multiple gene regulator of gas), emm (m protein), scpa (complement c5a peptidase), or speb or spec (pyrogenic exotoxins b and c). the amounts of streptokinase, streptolysin s, and capsule paralleled the levels of transcription of their genes in all cases. because csrr represses genes unrelated to those for  capsule synthesis, and because csra-csrb is a global regulatory system in escherichia coli whose mechanism is unrelated to that of these genes in gas, the  locus has been renamed covr, for "control of virulence genes" in gas. transcription of the covr operon was also increased in the nonpolar insertion mutant, indicating that covr represses its own synthesis as well. all phenotypes  of the covr nonpolar insertion mutant were complemented by the covr gene on a plasmid. covr acts on operons expressed both in exponential and in stationary phase, demonstrating that the covr-covs pathway is separate from growth phase-dependent regulation in gas. therefore, covr is the first multiple-gene repressor of virulence factors described for this important human pathogen.

TI  == protein grab of streptococcus pyogenes regulates proteolysis at the bacterial surface by binding alpha2-macroglobulin.
AB  == in the molecular interplay between pathogenic microorganisms and their host, proteolytic mechanisms are believed to play a crucial role. here we find that the important human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) expresses a surface protein with high affinity (ka = 2.0 x 10(8) m-1) for alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2m), the dominating proteinase inhibitor of human plasma. the immunoglobulin-binding protein g of group c and g streptococci also contains an alpha2m-binding domain and a gene encoding protein grab (protein g-related alpha2m-binding protein) was identified in the s. pyogenes genome sequencing data base. the grab gene is present in most s. pyogenes strains and is well conserved. protein grab has typical features of a surface-attached protein of gram-positive bacteria. it also contains a region homologous to parts of the alpha2m-binding domain of protein g and a variable number of a unique 28-amino acid-long repeat. using escherichia coli-produced protein grab and synthetic grab peptides, the alpha2m-binding region was mapped to the nh2-terminal part of protein grab, which is the region with homology to protein g. an isogenic s. pyogenes mutant lacking surface-associated protein grab showed no alpha2m binding activity and was attenuated in virulence when injected intraperitoneally in mice. finally, alpha2m bound to the bacterial surface via protein grab was found to entrap and inhibit the activity of both s. pyogenes and host proteinases, thereby protecting important virulence determinants from proteolytic degradation. this regulation of proteolytic activity at the bacterial surface should affect the host-microbe relation during s. pyogenes infections.

TI  == structure-activity studies of normal and retro pig cecropin-melittin hybrids.
AB  == chimeric analogs of cecropin p1 and melittin with normal and retro sequences were synthesized to explore the effect of sequence, amide bond direction (helical dipole), charge, amphipathicity and hydrophobicity on their antibacterial activity and channel-forming ability. when viewed from the opposite end by rotation in the plane 180 degrees retro analogs have the same sequence as the parent with reversed amide bond and helical dipole directions. the expected activities were related to the important structural features and a series of assumptions were made. retro analogs are expected to be inactive if both sequence and amide bond direction make critical contributions to the activity. cp1(1-10)m(2-9) amide, (swlsktakkligavlkvl), showed a broad antibacterial spectrum with high activity against the two gram-negative and three gram-positive bacteria tested. retro-cp1(1-10)m(2-9) was less active compared to its normal peptide. cp1(1-9)m(1-8) and cp1(1-9)m(2-8) amides were found to be active against gram-negative escherichia coli and also gram-positive streptococcus pyogenes, but inactive against the other test organisms. the corresponding retro analogs were inactive against all the five bacteria tested. these results suggest that both sequence and amide bond direction (helix dipole) are important structural requirements for the activity of cp1-m hybrids. acetylation of the n-terminal amine in both normal and retro analogs lowered their activity, indicating the contribution of free amine to the activity. these analogs form ion-conducting channels in lipid bilayers. the action of the peptides may be explained by self-aggregation and formation of ion-conducting pores across bacterial membranes. conformational analysis obtained from cd measurements showed that all  analogs form amphipathic alpha-helices in presence of 12-20% hexafluoro isopropanol. the retro cp1(1-10)m(2-9) amide showed higher helicity and is more potent compared to other retro analogs synthesized. these studies show the effect of small sequence modifications on the biological activity of the peptides and on their alpha-helical conformation in hfip, the structure-inducing organic solvent.

AB  == a 1-yr field investigation of clinical mastitis in heifers was carried out in 24  veterinary districts in norway. quarter lacteal secretions from cases that occurred prepartum or within 14 d postpartum were examined bacteriologically. the study included 1040 heifers with clinical mastitis, and the total number of quarters that were clinically affected was 1361. the organisms that were most frequently isolated from samples from these quarters were staphylococcus aureus (44.3%), streptococcus dysgalactiae (18.2%), staph. aureus together with strep. dysgalactiae (1.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (12.8%), arcanobacterium pyogenes (3.5%), a. pyogenes together with strep. dysgalactiae (0.5%) or staph. aureus (0.4%), and escherichia coli (6.4%). of the coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus simulans (53.7%), staphylococcus hyicus (14.8%), and staphylococcus chromogenes (14.8%) were the most prevalent species. except for a higher relative percentage of a. pyogenes in cases that occurred before parturition (8.2%) than in cases that occurred after parturition (2.7%), no significant differences were observed in the distribution of the various organisms among prepartum and postpartum cases. regional variations were observed in the distribution of organisms. the proportions of staph. aureus and a. pyogenes were highest, and the proportion of coagulase-negative staphylococci was lowest, in late autumn and early winter. the proportion of e. coli was highest in summer. in heifers in which mastitis was associated with increased rectal temperature or other systemic signs, the proportion of clinically affected quarters that were infected with staph. aureus was larger than that in heifers without systemic reaction.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

AB  == the two hyaluronan synthases (hass) from streptococcus pyogenes (sphas) and streptococcus equisimilis (sehas) were expressed in escherichia coli as recombinant proteins containing his6 tails. the accompanying paper has described  the purification and lipid dependence of both hass, their preference for cardiolipin, and their stability during storage (tlapak-simmons, v. l., baggenstoss, b. a., clyne, t., and weigel, p. h. (1999) j. biol. chem. 274, 4239-4245). kinetic characterization of the enzymes in isolated membranes gave km values for udp-glcua of 40 +/- 4 microm for sphas and 51 +/- 5 microm for sehas.  in both cases, the vmax profiles at various concentrations of udp-glcnac were hyperbolic, with no evidence of cooperativity. in contrast, membrane-bound sphas, but not sehas, showed sigmoidal behavior as the udp-glcnac concentration was increased, with a hill number of approximately 2, indicating significant cooperativity. the hill number for udp-glcnac utilization by sehas was 1, confirming the lack of cooperativity for udp-glcnac in this enzyme. the km values for udp-glcnac were 60 +/- 7 microm for sehas and 149 +/- 3 microm for sphas in the isolated membranes. the kinetic characteristics of the two affinity-purified  has enzymes were assessed in the presence of cardiolipin after 8-9 days of storage at -80 degreesc without cardiolipin. with increasing storage time, the enzymes showed a gradual increase in their km values for both substrates and a decrease in vmax. even in the presence of cardiolipin, the detergent-solubilized, purified hass had substantially higher km values for both substrates than the membrane-bound enzymes. the kudp-glcua for purified sphas and sehas increased 2-4-fold. the kudp-glcnac for sphas and sehas increased 4- and 5-fold, respectively. despite the higher km values, the vmax values for the purified hass were only approximately 50% lower than those for the membrane-bound enzymes. significantly, purified sphas displayed the same cooperative interaction with udp-glcnac (nh approximately 2), whereas purified sehas showed no cooperativity.

TI  == purification and lipid dependence of the recombinant hyaluronan synthases from streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus equisimilis.
AB  == the two hyaluronan synthases (hass) from streptococcus pyogenes (sphas) and streptococcus equisimilis (sehas) were expressed in escherichia coli as recombinant proteins containing his6 tails. both enzymes were expressed as major  membrane proteins, accounting for approximately 5-8% of the total membrane protein. using nickel chelate affinity chromatography, the hass were purified to  homogeneity from n-dodecyl beta-d-maltoside extracts. high levels of has activity could be achieved only if the purified enzymes were supplemented with either bovine or e. coli cardiolipin (cl), although bovine cl gave consistently greater  activity. mass spectroscopic analysis revealed that the fatty acid compositions of these two cl preparations did not overlap. the two has enzymes showed similar  but distinct activation profiles with the 10 other lipids tested. for example, phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylethanolamine stimulated sehas, but not sphas. phosphatidylserine stimulated both enzymes. sphas appears to be more cl-specific  than sehas, although both purified enzymes still contain endogenous cl that can not easily be removed. both sehas and sphas were inhibited by phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and sulfatides and were not substantially stimulated by cerebrosides, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidylinositol. with both hass, cl increased the km for udp-glcua, but decreased the km for udp-glcnac and gave an overall stimulation of vmax. a kinetic characterization of the two membrane-bound and purified hass is presented in the accompanying paper (tlapak-simmons, v. l., baggenstoss, b. a., kumari, k., heldermon, c., and weigel, p. h. (1999) j. biol. chem. 274, 4246-4253). both purified hass became inactive after storage for approximately 5 days at 4 degreesc. both purified enzymes also lost activity over 4-5 days when stored at -80 degreesc in the presence of cl, but reached a level of activity that then slowly decreased over a period of months. although the purified enzymes stored in the absence of cl at -80 degreesc were much less active, the enzymes retained this same low level of activity for at least 5 weeks. when both sphas and sehas were stored without cl at -80 degreesc, even after 2 months, they could be stimulated by the addition of bovine cl to approximately 60% of the initial activity of the freshly purified enzyme.

TI  == streptococcus pyogenes protein f promotes invasion of hela cells.
AB  == although the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) has been considered an extracellular pathogen which adheres to human mucosal epithelium, the streptococcus possesses invasive capacity for cultured human epithelial cells. this study provides genetic and functional evidence supporting the conclusion that protein f is capable of mediating entry of s. pyogenes into hela cells. using tn916 insertion mutagenesis or an isogenic  s. pyogenes strain with a defined mutation in the gene encoding protein f (prtf), it was observed that the invasive capacity was affected by the levels of surface-exposed protein f, but not by those of m protein. in addition, heterologous expression of protein f on enterococcus faecalis conferred upon the  bacteria an efficient invasive phenotype. several assays demonstrated that both the fibronectin-binding domains of protein f, ur and rd2, were involved in host-cell invasion. in addition, coinfection experiments of hela cells with s. pyogenes and an escherichia coli k-12 strain expressing an afimbrial adhesin afa-i showed that the uptake of s. pyogenes did not permit internalization of the e. coli cells.

AB  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae has been cloned and sequenced. escherichia coli cells harboring the recombinant plasmid pmmg2 (galu) overproduced a protein that has been shown to correspond to a uridine 5'-triphosphate:glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (uridine diphosphoglucose [udp-glc] pyrophosphorylase) responsible for the synthesis of udp-glc, a key compound in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides. a gene very similar to the s. pneumoniae galu has been found in a partial nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus pyogenes genome. knockout galu mutants of type 1 pneumococci are unable to synthesize a detectable capsule. an identical result was found in type  3 s. pneumoniae cells in spite of the fact that these bacteria contain a type-specific gene (cap3c) that also encodes a udp-glc pyrophosphorylase. since eukaryotic udp-glc pyrophosphorylases appear to be completely unrelated to their  prokaryotic counterparts, we postulate that galu may be an appropriate target for the search of new drugs to control the pathogenicity of bacteria like pneumococcus and s. pyogenes.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  == clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. a total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. the traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). a total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), peptostreptococcus spp (113), clostridium spp (78), prevotella spp (58), and fusobacterium spp (23). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (83), staphylococcus aureus (61), streptococcus pyogenes (27), streptococcus group d (16), and klebsiella pneumoniae (16). the types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). s. aureus was isolated at all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck  wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). this study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of pathogenic microflora: data of the bacteriological laboratory at the antituberculosis clinic].
AB  == a total of 426 cultures for nonspecific organisms, made at the bacteriological laboratory of the antituberculosis dispensary, were analyzed. escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were most common among the isolated pathogens. evaluation of antibiotic sensitivity by using the disks showed augmentin, cefuroxime axetil, and ciprofloxacin to be most effective. streptomycin and rifampicin resistance of pathogens was highest. in patients with tuberculosis, the non-tuberculosis flora showed resistance to the drugs widely used in general practice (ampicillin, carbenicillin, oxacillin, lincomycin, erythromycin). among macrolides, rovamycin was more effective than erythromycin.  it is concluded that when wide-spectrum antibiotics are prescribed, new and potent drugs should be used in a tuberculosis hospital.

TI  == blue/white screening of recombinant plasmids in gram-positive bacteria by interruption of alkaline phosphatase gene (phoz) expression.
AB  == the process of screening bacterial transformants for recombinant plasmids is made more rapid and simple by the use of vectors with visually detectable reporter genes. in such systems, an alteration in colony phenotype occurs when a vector-borne indicator gene is interrupted with exogenous dna. although the lacz  system has been used extensively for this purpose in e. coli, analogous systems for use in gram-positive bacteria remain uncommon. we have developed a gram-positive cloning vector that utilizes the interruption of an alkaline phosphatase gene, phoz, to identify recombinant plasmids. to facilitate introduction of foreign dna, a multiple cloning site (mcs) was inserted distal to the region coding for the putative signal peptide of phoz. alkaline phosphatase expressed from the derivative phoz gene (phozmcs) retained activity similar to that of the native protein. the phozmcs was transferred to pjs3, a well-characterized, high-copy number, and broad-host-range plasmid, to produce pdc123. in pdc123, phozmcs was transcriptionally linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene under the control of the constitutively expressed tetm and cat promoters that drive cat expression in pjs3. s. agalactiae (group b  streptococci, gbs), e. faecalis, s. pyogenes, s. gordonii, and e. coli containing pdc123 displayed a blue colonial phenotype on agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (x-p), which was readily distinguished from  that of colonies containing the parent plasmid pjs3. introduction of foreign dna  into the mcs of phozmcs produced a white colonial phenotype in e. coli and gbs on agar containing x-p and allowed discrimination between transformants containing recombinant plasmids versus those maintaining self-annealed or uncut vector. we have used pdc123 to subclone the cpse gene from the plasmid pcer111, which carries a 9.0-kb fragment of the gbs capsular polysaccharide synthesis locus. the plasmid pdc123 containing cpse was isolated by direct electroporation into gbs strain a909 with selection of transformants containing recombinant plasmids achieved by 'blue/white' screening, without the use of an intermediate host. this new cloning vector should improve the efficiency of performing recombinant dna experiments in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == h-ns regulates dna repair in shigella.
AB  == we report a new role for h-ns in shigella spp.: suppression of repair of dna damage after uv irradiation. h-ns-mediated suppression of virulence gene expression is thermoregulated in shigella, being functional at 30 degrees c and nonfunctional at 37 to 40 degrees c. we find that h-ns-mediated suppression of dna repair after uv irradiation is also thermoregulated. thus, shigella flexneri  m90t, incubated at 37 or 40 degrees c postirradiation, shows up to 30-fold higher survival than when incubated at 30 degrees c postirradiation. the hns mutants bs189 and bs208, both of which lack functional h-ns, show a high rate of survival (no repression) whether incubated at 30 or 40 degrees c postirradiation. suppression of dna repair by h-ns is not mediated through genes on the invasion plasmid of s. flexneri m90t, since bs176, cured of plasmid, behaves identically to the parental m90t. thus, in shigella the nonfunctionality of h-ns permits enhanced dna repair at temperatures encountered in the human host. however, pathogenic escherichia coli strains (enteroinvasive and enterohemorrhagic e. coli) show low survival whether incubated at 30 or 40 degrees c postirradiation.  e. coli k-12 shows markedly different behavior; high survival postirradiation at  both 30 and 40 degrees c. these k-12 strains were originally selected from e. coli organisms subjected to both uv and x irradiation. therefore, our data suggest that repair processes, extensively described for laboratory strains of e. coli, require experimental verification in pathogenic strains which were not adapted to irradiation.

TI  == the active streptococcal hyaluronan synthases (hass) contain a single has monomer and multiple cardiolipin molecules.
AB  == the functional sizes of the two streptococcal hyaluronan synthases (hass) were determined by radiation inactivation analysis of isolated membranes. the native enzymes in membranes from group a streptococcus pyogenes has and group c streptococcus equisimilis has were compared with the recombinant proteins expressed in escherichia coli membranes. based on their amino acid sequences, the masses of these four proteins as monomers are approximately 48 kda. in all cases, loss of enzyme activity was a simple single exponential function with increasing  radiation dose. the functional sizes calculated from these data were identical for the four hass at approximately 64 kda. in contrast, the sizes of the proteins estimated by the loss of antibody reactivity on western blots were essentially identical at 41 kda for the four has species, consistently lower than the functional size by approximately 23 kda. matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry analysis of purified s. pyogenes has-h6 and s. equisimilis has-h6 gave masses that differed by <0.07% from the predicted monomer sizes, which confirms that neither protein is posttranslationally modified or covalently attached to another protein. ongoing studies indicate that the purified has enzymes require cardiolipin (cl) for maximal activity and stability. when irradiated membranes were detergent solubilized and the extracts were incubated with exogenous cl, the residual level of has activity increased. consequently, the calculated functional size decreased by approximately 23 kda to the expected size of the has monomer. the approximately 23-kda larger size of the functional has enzyme, compared with the has monomer, is due, therefore, to cl molecules. we propose that the active streptococcal ha synthases are monomers in  complex with approximately 16 cl molecules.

TI  == isolation, cdna cloning and gene expression of an antibacterial protein from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros.
AB  == an antibacterial protein, designated rhinocerosin, was purified to homogeneity from larvae of the coconut rhinoceros beetle, oryctes rhinoceros immunized with escherichia coli. based on the amino acid sequence of the n-terminal region, a degenerate primer was synthesized and reverse-transcriptase pcr was performed to  clone rhinocerosin cdna. as a result, a 279-bp fragment was obtained. the complete nucleotide sequence was determined by sequencing the extended rhinocerosin cdna clone by 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends. the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature portion of rhinocerosin was composed of 72 amino acids without cystein residues and was shown to be rich in glycine (11.1%) and proline (11.1%) residues. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rhinocerosin with those of other antibacterial proteins indicated that it has 77.8% and 44.6% identity with holotricin 2 and coleoptrecin, respectively. rhinocerosin had strong antibacterial activity against e. coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus but not against pseudomonas aeruginosa. results of reverse-transcriptase pcr analysis of gene expression in different tissues indicated that the rhinocerosin gene is strongly expressed in the fat body and the malpighian tubule, and weakly expressed in hemocytes and midgut. in addition, gene expression was inducible by bacteria in the fat body, the malpighian tubule  and hemocyte but constitutive expression was observed in the midgut.

TI  == site-directed mutagenesis of streptococcal plasmin receptor protein (plr) identifies the c-terminal lys334 as essential for plasmin binding, but mutation of the plr gene does not reduce plasmin binding to group a streptococci.
AB  == plasmin(ogen) binding is a common property of many pathogenic bacteria including  group a streptococci. previous analysis of a putative plasmin receptor protein, plr, from the group a streptococcal strain 64/14 revealed that it is a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and that the plr gene is present on the  chromosome as a single copy. this study continues the functional characterization of plr as a plasmin receptor. attempts at insertional inactivation of the plr gene suggested that this single-copy gene may be essential for cell viability. therefore, an alternative strategy was applied to manipulate this gene in vivo. site-directed mutagenesis of plr revealed that a c-terminal lysyl residue is required for wild-type levels of plasmin binding. mutated plr proteins expressed  in escherichia coli demonstrated reduced plasmin-binding activity yet retained glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. a novel integration vector was constructed to precisely replace the wild-type copy of the plr gene with these mutations. isogenic streptococcal strains expressing altered plr bound equivalent amounts of plasmin as wild-type streptococci. these data suggest that plr does not function as a unique plasmin receptor, and underscore the need to identify other plasmin-binding structures on group a streptococci and to assess the importance of the plasminogen system in pathogenesis by inactivation of plasminogen activators and the use of appropriate animal models.

AB  == background: cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of bush group 1 beta-lactamases. in vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli was studied. methods: the agar dilution method described by the us national committee for clinical laboratory standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. these included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the tested clinical isolates included gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, group d enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, burkholderia cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia). results:  the activity of cefepime against most gram-negative bacilli other than b cepacia  and x maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. however, cefepime is less active against these gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. the activity of cefepime against b cepacia and x maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. among gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, s pyogenes, viridans streptococci and s pneumoniae. however, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant s aureus and enterococci. conclusions: due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == mobilization of potent plasma bactericidal activity during systemic bacterial challenge. role of group iia phospholipase a2.
AB  == extracellular mobilization of group iia 14-kd phospholipase a2 (pla2) in glycogen-induced rabbit inflammatory peritoneal exudates is responsible for the potent bactericidal activity of the inflammatory fluid toward staphylococcus aureus (1996. j. clin. invest. 97:250-257). because similar levels of pla2 are induced in plasma during systemic inflammation, we have tested whether this gives rise to plasma bactericidal activity not present in resting animals. baboons were injected intravenously (i.v.) with a lethal dose of escherichia coli and plasma or serum was collected before and at hourly intervals after injection. after infusion of bacteria, pla2 levels in plasma and serum rose > 100-fold over 24 h to approximately 1 microg pla2/ml. serum collected at 24 h possessed potent bactericidal activity toward s. aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and encapsulated  e. coli not exhibited by serum collected from unchallenged animals. bactericidal  activity toward s. aureus and s. pyogenes was nearly completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody to human group iia pla2 and addition of purified human group  iia pla2 to prechallenge serum conferred potent antistaphylococcal and antistreptococcal activity equal to that of the 24 h post-challenge serum. pla2-dependent bactericidal activity was enhanced approximately 10x by factor(s)  present constitutively in serum or plasma. bactericidal activity toward encapsulated e. coli was accompanied by extensive bacterial phospholipid degradation mediated, at least in part, by the mobilized group iia pla2 but depended on the action of other bactericidal factors in the 24-h serum. these findings further demonstrate the contribution of group iia pla2 to the antibacterial potency of biological fluids and suggest that mobilization of this  enzyme during inflammation may play an important role in host defense against invading bacteria.

TI  == the group a streptococcal dipeptide permease (dpp) is involved in the uptake of essential amino acids and affects the expression of cysteine protease.
AB  == the majority of characterized bacterial dipeptide permeases (dpp) are membrane-associated complexes of five proteins belonging to the abc-transporter family. they have been found to be involved in the uptake of essential amino acids, haem production, chemotaxis and sporulation. a 5.8 kb genomic dna fragment of the serotype m49 group a streptococcal (gas) strain cs101 was sequenced and found to contain five putative gas dpp genes (dppa to dppe). deduced amino acid sequences exhibited 17-54% similarity to corresponding abc-transporter sequences. the operon organization of the five genes was confirmed by transcriptional analysis, and a shorter, more abundant, dppa-only transcript was detected similar to that found in the gas oligopeptide permease (opp) system. insertional inactivation was used to create serotype m2 and m49 strains that did not express  the dppd and dppeatpase genes or nearly the entire operon. in feeding experiments with di- to hexapeptides, the wild-type strain grew with each peptide tested. the dpp mutants were unable to grow on dipeptides, whereas hexapeptides did not sustain the growth of opp mutants. expression of the dpp operon was induced approximately fourfold in late exponential growth phase. in addition, a striking  increase in the dppa to dppa-e ratio from 5:1 to more than 20:1 occurred during late exponential growth phase in complex medium. growth in chemically defined medium (cdm) supplemented with various dipeptides specifically induced the expression of dpp and reduced both the dppa to dppa-e and oppa to oppa-f mrna ratios. expression of the virulence factor speb (major cysteine protease) was reduced eightfold in dpp mutants, whereas dpp expression was decreased about fourfold in a mga virulence regulator mutant. taken together, these data indicate a correlation between levels of intracellular essential amino acids and the regulation of virulence factor expression.

TI  == structure of the has operon promoter and regulation of hyaluronic acid capsule expression in group a streptococcus.
AB  == group a streptococcal strains vary widely in the amount of hyaluronic acid capsule they produce, although the has operon, which encodes the enzymes required for hyaluronic acid synthesis, is highly conserved. the three genes making up the has operon are transcribed from a single promoter located upstream of the first gene in the operon, hasa. to investigate transcriptional regulation of capsule synthesis, we studied the structure and function of the has operon promoter sequences from two strains of group a streptococcus: a highly encapsulated m-type 18 strain and a poorly encapsulated m-type 3 strain. transcriptional fusions of the has operon promoter to a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene  were constructed in a temperature-sensitive shuttle vector. the influence of promoter structure on has operon transcription was reflected by chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity in cell lysates of escherichia coli harbouring the recombinant plasmids and in group a streptococcus after integration of the promoter fusions into the streptococcal chromosome. fusions including as few as 12 nucleotides upstream from the -35 site of the has promoter exhibited full activity, indicating that sequences further upstream do not affect has gene transcription. a transcriptional fusion of the has promoter from the highly encapsulated m-type 18 strain was threefold more active than a similar construct  from the poorly encapsulated m-type 3 strain. analysis of the promoter sequences  for the two strains revealed differences in three nucleotides in the -35, -10 spacer region of the promoter and in four nucleotides in the +2 to +8 positions relative to the start site of hasa transcription. to determine the relative importance of the two groups of nucleotide substitutions, chimeric promoter sequences were constructed in which either of the two clusters of variant nucleotides from the m18 has promoter was substituted for the corresponding positions in the m3 has promoter. analysis of these chimeric promoter fusions showed that sequence changes in both regions influenced promoter strength. these  results define the limits of cis-acting chromosomal sequences that influence transcription of the has operon and indicate that the fine structure of the promoter is an important determinant of capsule gene expression in group a streptococcus.

AB  == in vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (cftm)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. a  total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across japan during 1996. cftm showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and s. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. of the s. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (prsp), with mic values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the mic50 of cftm against prsp was 1.0 microgram/ml. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against  e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. a few strains of e. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. mic values against p. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. the reason for  this discrepancy is unknown. most strains of s. marcescens, c. freundii, and e. cloacae demonstrated resistance to cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems. cftm and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, n. gonorrhoeae, and h. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == identification of a novel insertion element, is1548, in group b streptococci, predominantly in strains causing endocarditis.
AB  == hyaluronidase has been postulated to be a virulence factor in group b streptococci (gbs). no hyaluronidase activity was found in 15 of 50 gbs isolates  from adults studied. most of these hyaluronidase-negative strains belonged to serotype iii. in strains lacking hyaluronidase activity, an insertion of 1317 nucleotides was found in the hyaluronidase gene. the fragment was cloned and sequenced and found to have characteristics of a novel insertion sequence, designated is1548. as well as in gbs serotype iii, this sequence was found in 3 of 6 serotype ii isolates and in all 10 group a streptococcal strains (gas) tested. homologies were found with repeated sequences in streptococcus pneumoniae and with h repeats in escherichia coli. all gbs strains harboring is1548 and some gas strains had one copy of is1548 located downstream of the c5a peptidase gene.  is1548 was present in 9 of 13 gbs isolates from blood in endocarditis patients and in 3 of 22 vaginally colonizing strains.

TI  == molecular co-operation between protein pam and streptokinase for plasmin acquisition by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == bacterial surface-associated plasmin formation is believed to contribute to invasion, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. to  define the components necessary for plasmin generation on group a streptococci we used strain ap53 which exposes an m-like protein ("pam") that contains a plasminogen-binding sequence with two 13-amino acid residues long tandem repeats  (a1 and a2). utilizing an escherichia coli-streptococcal shuttle vector, we replaced a 29-residue long sequence segment of arp4, an m-like protein that does  not bind plasminogen, with a single (a1) or the combined a1a2 repeats of pam. when expressed in e. coli, the purified chimeric arp/pam proteins both bound plasminogen, as well as plasmin, and when used to transform group a streptococcal strains lacking the plasminogen-binding ability, transformants with the arp/pam constructs efficiently bound plasminogen. moreover, when grown in the presence of plasminogen, both arp/pam- and pam-expressing streptococci acquired surface-bound plasmin. in contrast, plasminogen activation failed to occur on pam- and arp/pam-expressing streptococci carrying an inactivated streptokinase gene: this  block was overcome by exogenous streptokinase. together, these results provide evidence for an unusual co-operation between a surface-bound protein, pam, and a  secreted protein, streptokinase, resulting in bacterial acquisition of a host protease that is likely to spur parasite invasion of host tissues.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

TI  == discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  == a 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. antibacterial assays against streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli imp- and a candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position a (secondary amine), at the  end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. the range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting  the first-round active sublibraries. pyridinopolyamine positions b (secondary benzylamine) and c (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. high-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18,  and 21 with mics of 1-5 microm against s. pyogenes and e. coli imp-. using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position c and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position b with position d (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier ii panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, s. pyogenes, s. pyogenes (wild-type), streptomyces aureus, and enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at mics of 1-12 microm, whereas mics for e.  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were >  100 microm. these eight compounds were not active (> 100 microm) against fungus c. albicans.

TI  == expression and characterization of group a streptococcus extracellular cysteine protease recombinant mutant proteins and documentation of seroconversion during human invasive disease episodes.
AB  == a recent study with isogenic strains constructed by recombinant dna strategies unambiguously documented that a highly conserved extracellular cysteine protease  expressed by streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) is a critical virulence factor in a mouse model of invasive disease (s. lukomski, s. sreevatsan, c. amberg, w. reichardt, m. woischnik, a. podbielski, and j. m. musser, j. clin. invest. 99:2574-2580, 1997). to facilitate further investigations of the streptococcal cysteine protease, recombinant proteins composed of a 40-kda zymogen containing a c192s amino acid substitution that ablates enzymatic activity, a 28-kda mature protein with the c192s replacement, and a 12-kda propeptide were purified from escherichia coli containing his tag expression vectors. the recombinant c192s zymogen retained apparently normal structural integrity, as assessed by the ability of purified wild-type streptococcal cysteine protease to process the 40-kda molecule to the 28-kda mature form. all three recombinant purified proteins retained immunologic reactivity with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. humans with a diverse range of invasive disease episodes (erysipelas, cellulitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, septic arthritis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, and necrotizing fasciitis)  caused by six distinct m types of gas seroconverted to the streptococcal cysteine protease. these results demonstrate that this gas protein is expressed in vivo during the course of human infections and thereby provide additional evidence that the cysteine protease participates in host-pathogen interactions in some patients.

TI  == molecular cloning, expression, and characterization of the authentic hyaluronan synthase from group c streptococcus equisimilis.
AB  == we previously reported the first cloning of a functional glycosaminoglycan synthase, the hyaluronan synthase (has) from group a streptococcus pyogenes (sphas) (deangelis, p. l., papaconstantinou, j., and weigel, p. h. (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 19181-19184). group a sphas was unrelated to a putative group c  ha synthase reported by others (lansing, m., lellig, s., mausolf, a., martini, i. , crescenzi, f., oregon, m., and prehm, p. (1993) biochem. j. 289, 179-184). here we report the isolation of a bona fide ha synthase gene from a highly encapsulated strain of group c streptococcus equisimilis. the encoded protein, designated sehas, is 417 amino acids long (calculated molecular weight, 47,778; calculated pi, 9.1) and is the smallest member of the has family identified thus  far. the enzyme migrates anomalously fast in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (approximately 42,000 da). the sehas protein shows no similarity  (<2% identity) to the previously reported group c gene, which is not an ha synthase. the sehas and sphas protein and coding sequences are 72 and 70% identical, respectively. sehas is also similar to eukaryotic has1 (approximately  31% identical), has2 (approximately 28% identical), and has3 (28% identical). the deduced protein sequence of sehas was confirmed by reactivity with a synthetic peptide antibody. recombinant sehas expressed in escherichia coli was recovered in membranes as a major protein (approximately 10% of the total protein) and synthesized very large ha (mr >7 x 10(6)) in the presence of udp-glcnac and udp-glca. the product contained equimolar amounts of both sugars and was degraded by the specific streptomyces hyaluronidase. comparison of the two recombinant streptococcal enzymes in isolated membranes showed that sehas and sphas are essentially identical in the steady-state size distribution of ha chains they synthesize, but sehas has an intrinsic 2-fold faster rate of chain elongation (vmax) than sphas. sehas is the most active ha synthase identified thus far; it polymerizes ha at an average rate of 160 monosaccharides/s. the two bacterial ha  synthase genes may have arisen from a common ancient gene shared with the early evolving vertebrates.

TI  == autoantibodies with a protective function: polyreactive antibodies against alkaline phosphatase in bacterial infections.
AB  == in patients with acute bacterial infections antibodies directed against a particular bacterial antigen were detected. the molecular mass of this bacterial  antigen was 50 kda as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. by comparison of the nh2-terminal amino acid sequence, the 50-kda antigen was identified as alkaline phosphatase (ap). affinity-purified antibodies from patient's sera directed against the bacterial ap (anti-alpha) were also shown to react with human and animal ap, which have different structures. anti-alpha are igg subtype 3 immunoglobulins, and their light chains  are of the kappa type. upon isoelectric focussing, the anti-alpha formed a scalariform pattern with five to seven bands in the ph range 7-9. the anti-alpha  have an opsonic activity and cause a five- to eightfold increase of phagocytosis  of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. according to their polyreactivity, their sudden rise early in infection, their oligoclonality, as well as their opsonizing properties, they are assumed to be permanently available natural antibodies that take part in early defence mechanisms.

TI  == exclusion of bioactive contaminations in streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin a preparations by recombinant expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == the streptococcal erythrogenic exotoxin a (spea) belongs to the family of bacterial superantigens and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a toxic shock-like syndrome and scarlet fever. concerning its biological activity, mainly t-cell-stimulatory properties, conflicting data exist. in this study, we show that most of the spea preparations used so far contain biologically active contaminations. natural spea from the culture supernatant of streptococcus pyogenes ny-5 and recombinant spea purified from the culture filtrate of s. sanguis are strongly contaminated with dnases. we show that natural spea induces  more tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) than recombinant spea, but we also show that dnases are able to induce tnf-alpha. in commercial spea preparations, we identified a highly active protease, which was shown not to be speb. to exclude these contaminations, we overexpressed spea cloned in the effective high-level expression vector pin-iii-ompa2 in escherichia coli. the expressed spea shows the same amino acid composition as natural spea, whereas functional studies reported so far were carried out with toxins containing an incorrect amino terminus. we describe the rapid purification of lipopolysaccharide-, dnase-, and protease-free spea in two steps from the host's periplasm and its structural characterization by circular dichroism. our results represent for the  first time the production in e. coli of recombinant spea with the authentic n-terminal sequence and a proven superantigenic activity. collectively, our results indicate that immunological studies of superantigens require highly purified substances free of biologically active contaminations.

TI  == the lppc gene of streptococcus equisimilis encodes a lipoprotein that is homologous to the e (p4) outer membrane protein from haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == we report the cloning, sequencing, and analysis of a novel chromosomal gene of streptococcus equisimilis strain h46a that codes for a membrane lipoprotein, designated lppc. the lppc gene is located 3' adjacent to, and co-oriented with, the unrelated gapc gene that encodes the previously characterized glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. sequencing of lppc revealed an 855-bp open reading frame that predicted a 32.4-kda polypeptide possessing a potential lipoprotein signal sequence and modification site (vtgc). signal sequence processing of lppc synthesized in the homologous host or expressed from plasmid plpp2 in escherichia coli was sensitive to globomycin, a selective inhibitor of lipoprotein-specific signal peptidase ii. subcellular localization of lppc using  polyclonal antibodies raised to the hexahistidyl-tagged protein proved lppc to be tightly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane of s. equisimilis and with the outer membrane of e. coli jm109 (plpp2). southern, northern and western analyses  indicated that lpp was conserved in s. pyogenes, and transcribed independently of gap as monocistronic 0.9-kb mrna from a sigma 70-like consensus promoter. database searches found homology of lppc to the hel gene-encoded outer membrane protein e (p4) from haemophilus influenzae to which it exhibits 58% sequence similarity. however, unlike the hel gene, lppc was unable to complement hema mutants of e. coli for growth on hemin as sole porphyrin source in aerobic conditions. furthermore, neither the wild type nor an lppc insertion mutant of s. equisimilis could grow on hemin in iron-limited medium. these results, together with findings indicating that s. equisimilis h46a had no absolute requirement for iron, led us to conclude that lppc, in contrast to hel, is not involved in hemin  utilization and has yet to be assigned a function.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new fluoroquinolone hsr-903 was compared with those  of ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. hsr-903 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) clinical isolates at 0.78 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively, and its activity against mrsa was 16-fold higher than those of sparfloxacin and levofloxacin and 64-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin. the mics at which 90% of the isolates  are inhibited (mic90s) of hsr-903 for streptococcus pyogenes and penicillin g-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) were 0.10, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. against prsp, the activity of hsr-903 was 4-fold higher than that of sparfloxacin and 32- to 256-fold higher than those of the other quinolones. the mic90 of hsr-903 for enterococcus faecalis was 0.20 microg/ml, and hsr-903 was more active than the other quinolones against enterococci. the activity of hsr-903 against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly similar to that of ciprofloxacin and greater than those of the other quinolones. against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and helicobacter pylori, hsr-903 was the most  potent of the quinolones tested. the activity of hsr-903 was not affected by the  medium, the inoculum size, or the addition of serum, but decreased under acidic conditions, as did those of the other quinolones tested. hsr-903 exhibited rapid  bactericidal action and had a good postantibiotic effect on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. hsr-903 inhibited supercoiling by dna gyrase from escherichia coli, but it was much less active against human topoisomerase ii.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem dz-2640.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of du-6681a, a parent compound of dz-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and mic90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively. mic90s of du-6681a  were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic50 and mic90 of du-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. du-6681a  activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) cfu), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to du-6681a was less  than or equal to those of the reference compounds. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of du-6681a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and h. influenzae.

TI  == intranasal immunization with c5a peptidase prevents nasopharyngeal colonization of mice by the group a streptococcus.
AB  == early inflammatory events are initiated by phased production of c5a and interleukin-8 in tissue. most serotypes of group a streptococci express a surface-bound peptidase (scpa) which specifically cleaves mouse and human c5a chemotaxins. this study investigates the impact of scpa on colonization of the nasopharyngeal mucosa of mice and evaluates its potential to induce protective immunity. two strains, serotypes m6 and m49, which contain insertion and deletion mutations in the scpa gene (scpa) and represent the two major subdivisions of group a streptococci, were characterized and compared in a mouse intranasal infection model. in this model, scpa mutants were more rapidly cleared from the nasopharynges of inoculated mice compared with wild-type strains. a 2,908-bp fragment of scpa49 gene, obtained by pcr, was ligated to the expression vector pgex-4t-1 and expressed in escherichia coli. the affinity-purified deltascpa49 protein proved to be highly immunogenic in mice and rabbits. although the purified deltascpa49 immunogen lacked enzymatic activity, it induced high titers  of rabbit antibodies which were able to neutralize peptidase activity associated  with m1, m6, m12, and m49 streptococci in vitro. this result confirmed that antipeptidase antibodies lack serotype specificity. intranasal immunization of mice with the deleted form of the scpa49 protein stimulated significant levels of specific salivary secretory immunoglobulin a (iga) and serum igg antibodies and reduced the potential of wild-type m1, m2, m6, m11, and m49 streptococci to colonize. these experiments suggest a new approach to vaccine development for prevention of streptococcal pharyngitis.

AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial action of cecropin and proline-arginine-rich peptides from pig intestine.
AB  == two antimicrobial peptides, cecropin p1 (cp1), with a c-terminal carboxyl group,  and pr-39, with an amidated, c-terminus, are found in the small intestine of the  pig. each is active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. we have synthesized these peptides and several analogs, including the d-enantiomers  and the retro sequences, each with a free or acetylated amino terminus. the cp1 amide was also prepared. the retro cp1 peptides were much less active than the parent cp1 peptide, confirming the importance of sequence or the amide bond and helix dipole direction, and the n alpha-acetyl peptides were also less active, indicating that a free amino terminus is essential for high activity. the ratio of the lethal concentration of l/d isomers of cp1 is less than 1 for gram-negative, but greater than 1 for gram-positive bacteria. pr-39 showed no significant chiral selectivity toward escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and streptococcus pyogenes, but the l/d ratio was high for pseudomonas aeruginosa (66), and very high for staphylococcus aureus (> 1000). in the latter case the lethal concentration for the d-isomer was 0.57 microm, whereas this organism was  quite resistant to the l-isomer (> 600 microm). thus the enantiomers of cp1 and pr-39 are not equally active for all species. in a plate assay with a very small  log-phase inoculum of staph aureus, d-pr-39 produced a clear zone of killing surrounded by a zone of stimulated growth. after prolonged incubation the two zones became one clear zone. addition of d-pr-39 to the wells of a dense turbid plate of growing cells showed a cleared zone for each of the test organisms, indicating that pr-39 lyses the bacteria rather than simply inhibiting their multiplication.

TI  == new tetracycline resistance determinants coding for ribosomal protection in streptococci and nucleotide sequence of tet(t) isolated from streptococcus pyogenes a498.
AB  == an approach based on pcr has been developed to identify new members of the tet gene family in streptococci resistant to tetracycline and minocycline. degenerate primers, corresponding to portions of the conserved domains of the proteins tet(m), tet(o), tetb(p), tet(q), and tet(s), all specifying the tetracycline-minocycline resistance phenotype, were used to selectively amplify dna fragments within the coding sequences. nine streptococcal strains which do not carry the genes tet(m), tet(o), tetb(p), tet(q), or tet(s) were investigated. four of them gave no detectable pcr products. the five remaining strains each yielded a pcr product of 1.1 kbp. dna hybridization experiments showed that these putative tet determinants fell into four new hybridization classes, of which one, tet t, was further analyzed. the gene tet(t) was isolated from streptococcus pyogenes a498, and the nucleotide sequence that was necessary and sufficient for  the expression of tetracycline resistance in escherichia coli was determined. the deduced tet(t) protein consists of 651 amino acids. the protein most closely related to tet(t) was tet(q), which has 49% identical amino acid residues. a phylogenetic analysis revealed that tet t represents a novel branching order among the tet determinants so far described.

TI  == molecular cloning and functional analysis of a novel macrolide-resistance determinant, mefa, from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == several streptococcal strains had an uncharacterized mechanism of macrolide resistance that differed from those that had been reported previously in the literature. this novel mechanism conveyed resistance to 14- and 15-membered macrolides, but not to 16-membered macrolides, lincosamides or analogues of streptogramin b. the gene encoding this phenotype was cloned by standard methods  from total genomic digests of streptococcus pyogenes 02c1064 as a 4.7 kb heterologous insert into the low-copy vector, pacyc177, and expressed in several  escherichia coli k-12 strains. the location of the macrolide-resistance determinant was established by functional analysis of deletion derivatives and sequencing. a search for homologues in the genetic databases confirmed that the gene is a novel one with homology to membrane-associated pump proteins. the macrolide-resistance coding sequence was subcloned into a pet23a vector and expressed from the inducible t7 promoter on the plasmid in e. coli bl21(de3). physiological studies of the cloned determinant, which has been named mefa for macrolide efflux, provide evidence for its mechanism of action in host bacteria.  e.coli strains containing the cloned determinant maintain lower levels of intracellular erythromycin when this compound is added to the external medium than isogenic clones without mefa. furthermore, intracellular accumulation of [14c]-erythromycin in the original s. pyogenes strain was always lower than that  observed in erythromycin-sensitive strains. this is consistent with a hypothesis  that the gene encodes a novel antiporter function which pumps erythromycin out of the cell. the gene appears to be widely distributed in s. pyogenes strains, as demonstrated by primer-specific synthesis using the polymerase chain reaction.

TI  == molecular characterization of a major serotype m49 group a streptococcal dnase gene (sdad).
AB  == group a streptococci (gas) express up to four types of secreted dnases. although  gas infections are correlated with the production of anti-dnase b antibodies, the roles of dnases in the pathogenesis of gas infections remain unclear. from a lambda library of serotype m49 strain cs101 gas genome, a 2,147-bp fragment expressing dnase activity on an indicator agar was identified and sequenced. one  1,155-bp open reading frame (orf) was identified in this fragment. this orf was found to be 48% identical on the amino acid level to group c streptococcal dnase  (sdc). the regions of highest homology corresponded to amino acid residues that were also identified as part of the active site in staphylococcal nuclease. transcription analysis revealed a specific 1.3-kb mrna, which corresponded to the size predicted by the promoter and transcription termination signature sequences  and indicated a monocistronic mode of transcription. allelic replacement of the orf rendered a m49 mutant devoid of extracellular dnase activity when cultured on indicator agar. virulence parameters such as resistance to phagocytosis were not  affected by the mutation. the sda gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli as a thioredoxin fusion. by performing ouchterlony immunodiffusion on the recombinant protein and by using protein preparations from culture supernatants of wild-type bacteria and the dnase mutant, the results of immunoreactivity with  dnase type-specific polyclonal rabbit antisera classified the dnase as a type d enzyme. fifty percent of patients with sera exhibiting high titers of antistreptolysin or anti-dnase b antibodies also had sdad-reactive antibodies in  comparison with <10% of serologically normal controls. while the value of recombinant sdad for diagnostic purposes needs to be clarified, the isogenic dnase mutant pair of m49 should allow the significance of gas dnase d as a bacterial virulence factor to be determined.

AB  == background: although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. this study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular ph, and low plasma glucose levels. study design and methods: day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees c for up to 5 days. in the morning  and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet ph, plasma glucose, and swirling. quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine ph and glucose levels. results: platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus mitis, or staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. the sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. although the sensitivity of the ph test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with e. cloacae had normal ph despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) cfu/ml). conclusion: the sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular ph or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with gram stain (10(5)-10(6) cfu/ml), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) cfu/ml), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal rna (10(3)-10(4) cfu/ml), and automated bacterial culture (1 cfu/sample volume).

TI  == novel series of plasmid vectors for gene inactivation and expression analysis in  group a streptococci (gas).
AB  == ten novel streptococcal shuttle vectors for genomic integration and allelic replacements have been constructed based on plasmid psf152. these vectors can replicate in e. coli, but not in streptococci because of the absence of a streptococcal origin of replication. the basic vector pfw5 (2.8 kb, aad9 spectinomycin-resistance marker) carries two multiple cloning sites mcs-i and mcs-ii (10 and 15 restrictions sites, respectively) to either side of the aad9 resistance gene. each mcs is flanked by transcription termination sites for stabilization of recombinant plasmids. in vector pfw6 the transcription terminator between aad9 and mcs-ii was deleted. plasmids pfw7 through pfw10 carry resistance genes for kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and tetracyclin instead of aad9. vectors pfw11 and pfw12 are pfw5/6 derivatives harboring an improved synthetic aad9 promoter. in pfw-phoa and pfw-gfp, promoterless alkaline  phosphatase and green fluorescent protein boxes were integrated into mcs-i. if streptococcal dna fragments are cloned into mcs-i and msc-ii, these vectors can be used for specific allelic replacements in streptococci via double-crossover recombinations. depending on the vector used, this event will not lead to polar effects, facilitating mutagenesis within operons. the vectors containing reporter boxes allow in vivo studies of gene expression and promoter activity in pathogenic streptococci and potentially, also in other gram-positive bacteria.

(b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == species-dependent post-translational modification and position 2 allelism: effects on streptococcal superantigen ssa structure and v beta specificity.
AB  == epidemiologic and molecular population genetic analyses support a role for superantigens (sag) in the pathogenesis of severe staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. to investigate how variations in sag structure influence immunomodulatory activity, we examined the biochemical and functional properties of two allelic variants of streptococcal sag ssa that differ at position 2. mass spectrometry revealed both recombinant (escherichia coli) and native (streptococcus pyogenes) ssa allelic variants to have significantly larger molecular masses than predicted by primary sequence alone and provided evidence that the proteins were modified by the addition of biochemical moieties, a phenomenon that has not been described for related sag. furthermore, the molecular masses of native and recombinant ssa were not the same; ssa was differentially post-translationally modified by the two bacterial genera. the substitution of e. coli-dependent processing for that of s. pyogenes altered both protease digestion and v beta specificity, suggesting that recombinant sag from e. coli may not accurately represent the native toxin. in addition, the observation that ssa allelic variants differed in v beta specificity supports a role for position 2 in ssa-tcr interactions. that ssa position 2 contributes to v beta specificity could not have been predicted from functional or crystallographic studies of other sag and suggests that ssa may adopt unique interactions with tcr and/or mhc class ii molecules. determining the structural basis for these differences should offer additional clues to the manner in which  sag exert their effects on the immune system during infection and may allow the designing of sag mutants with specific quantitative and qualitative immunomodulatory properties.

AB  == specimens obtained from eight children with necrotizing fasciitis (nf) were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 21 isolates were recovered, 13 anaerobic and 8 aerobic or facultatives. the facultative organism streptococcus pyogenes was present alone in two (25%) instances, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated in six (75%). the predominant isolates were peptostreptococcus spp. (6 isolates, including 3 peptostreptococcus magnus). s. pyogenes (4), bacteroides fragilis group (3), clostridium perfringens (2), escherichia coli (2), and prevotella spp. (2). organisms similar to the ones isolated from the nf aspirates were recovered in the blood of all patients except one. these included s. pyogenes (3 isolates). b. fragilis group (2), e. coli (1), and p. magnus (1) and clostridium perfringens (1). all patients underwent surgical fasciotomy, and four required skin grafting. antimicrobials were administered to all children. despite extensive resection and intense supportive  therapy, three patients died from sepsis accompanied by shock acidosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. these findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of nf in children.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and functional overexpression of the streptococcus equisimilis h46a gapc gene encoding a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase that also functions as a plasmin(ogen)-binding protein. purification and biochemical characterization of the protein.
AB  == we previously identified dna sequences involved in the function of the complex promoter of the streptokinase gene from streptococcus equisimilis h46a, a human serogroup c strain known to express this gene at a high level. as a prerequisite  to understanding possible mechanisms that control the balance between the plasminogen activating and plasmin(ogen) binding capacities of h46a, we describe  here its gapc gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (grap-dh, ec 1.2.1.12), a glycolytic enzyme apparently transported to the cell surface where it functions as a plasmin(ogen).binding protein. the gapc gene was cloned and sequenced and found to code for a 336-amino-acid polypeptide (approximately 35.9  kda) exhibiting 94.9% sequence identity to the plr protein from streptococcus pyogenes shown by others to be capable of plasmin binding [lottenberg, r., broder, c. c., boyle, m. d., kain, s. j., schroeder, b. l. & curtiss, r. iii (1992) j. bacteriol. 174, 5204-5210]. to study the properties of the gapc protein, its gene was inducibly overexpressed in escherichia coli from qiaexpress expression plasmids to yield the authentic gapc or (his)6gapc carrying a hexahistidyl n-terminus to permit affinity purification. both proteins were functionally active, exhibiting specific grap-dh activities of about 80 kat/mol (approximately 130 u/mg) after purification. their binding parameters [association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants, and equlibrium dissociation constants (kd = kd/ka)] for the interaction with human gluplasminogen and plasmin were determined by real-time biospecific interaction analysis using the pharmacia biacore instrument. for comparative purposes, the commercial grap-dh from bacillus stearothermophilus (bstgrap-dh), a nonpathogenic organism, was included in these experiments. the kd values for binding of plasminogen to gapc, (his)6gapc and bstgrap-dh were 220 nm, 260 nm and 520 nm, respectively, as compared to 25 nm, 17 nm and 98 nm, respectively, for the binding to plasmin. these data show that both the zymogen and active enzyme possess low-affinity binding sites for the gapc gene product and that the hexahistidyl terminus does not affect its function. prior limited treatment with  plasmin enhanced the subsequent plasminogen binding capacity of all three grap-dhs, presumably by the exposure of new c-terminal lysine residues for binding to the zymogen.

TI  == identification of isp, a locus encoding an immunogenic secreted protein conserved among group a streptococci.
AB  == the protein mga (mga), which is required for transcription of several virulence genes of group a streptococci (gas), including the antiphagocytic m protein, was  suggested to act as the response regulator element of a bacterial two-component pathway. to investigate whether a gene encoding a cognate sensor protein is located upstream of mga, 3.1 kb of dna 5' of the mga translational start site was cloned from serotype m6 gas strain jrs4. sequence analysis of this region revealed two adjacent open reading frames, a previously described orf and a new locus, isp (immunogenic secreted protein), which could encode proteins of 9 and 59 kda, respectively. inactivation of either open reading frame had no significant effect on transcription of the gene encoding m protein (emm) under normal growth conditions, suggesting that neither isp nor orf is involved in the  mga regulatory circuit. a protein migrating at an apparent molecular weight of 65,000 was produced when isp was transcribed and translated in vitro. the predicted isp product (isp) contains an amino-terminal signal sequence region homologous to that found in bacterial secreted proteins, and expression of isp in escherichia coli resulted in the presence of isp in the periplasmic fraction. convalescent-phase serum from a patient with an active gas infection recognized forms of isp both from the periplasm of e. coli and the supernatant of a gas strain. both isp and orf are highly conserved among strains of gas, as shown by hybridization analyses.

TI  == conservation of the c5a peptidase genes in group a and b streptococci.
AB  == the chromosome of group b streptococci (gbs) contains a gene which is related to  the c5a peptidase gene (scpa) of group a streptococci (gas). scpa encodes a surface-associated peptidase (group a streptococcal c5a peptidase [scpa]) which specifically cleaves c5a, a major chemoattractant generated in serum by activation of complement. the entire scpa-like gene (scpb) was cloned from a gbs  strain and sequenced. the gene encodes an open reading frame of 3,450 bp, which corresponds to a deduced protein (scpb) of 1,150 amino acids with a molecular weight of 126,237 da. nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of scpb were found to be highly homologous to those of scpas from gas. unexpectedly, scpa12 is more similar to scpb than to another gas gene, scpa49. the sequence 5' of the open reading frame, including transcription start and a termination site in the signal sequence, is also similar to that of scpa, although less conserved than the coding sequences. the near identity of gbs and gas peptidases is consistent with horizontal transmission of the scp gene between these species. recombinant scpb was expressed in escherichia coli by using the expression vector plasmid pgex-4t-1 and was shown to be identical in size to the enzyme extracted from the  parental gbs strain 78-471.

TI  == assembly of human contact phase proteins and release of bradykinin at the surface of curli-expressing escherichia coli.
AB  == previous work has demonstrated that most strains of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes bind kininogens through m protein, a fibrous surface protein and virulence determinant. here we find that strains of several other pathogenic bacterial species, both gram-positive and gram-negative, isolated from patients with sepsis, also bind kininogens, especially kininogen (hk). the most pronounced interaction was seen between hk and escherichia coli. among clinical isolates of e. coli, the majority of the enterohaemorrhagic, enterotoxigenic, and sepsis strains, but none of the enteroinvasive and enteropathogenic strains, bound hk. binding of hk to e. coli correlated with the expression of curli, another fibrous bacterial surface protein, and the binding of hk to purified curli was specific, saturable, and of high affinity; ka = 9 x 10(7) m-1. other contact phase proteins such as factor xi, factor xii, and prekallikrein bound to  curliated e. coli, but not to an isogenic curli-deficient mutant strain, suggesting that contact phase activation may occur at the surface of curliated bacteria. kininogens are also precursor molecules of the vasoactive kinins. when  incubated with human plasma, curli-expressing bacteria absorbed hk. addition of purified plasma kallikrein to the hk-loaded bacteria resulted in a rapid and efficient release of bradykinin from surface-bound hk. the assembly of contact phase factors at the surface of pathogenic bacteria and the release of the potent proinflammatory and vasoactive peptide bradykinin, should have a major impact on  the host-microbe relationship and may contribute to bacterial pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == substitution of cysteine 192 in a highly conserved streptococcus pyogenes extracellular cysteine protease (interleukin 1beta convertase) alters proteolytic activity and ablates zymogen processing.
AB  == virtually all strains of the human pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pyogenes express a highly conserved extracellular cysteine protease. the protein is made as an inactive zymogen of 40,000 da and undergoes autocatalytic truncation to result in a 28,000-da active protease. numerous independent lines of investigation suggest that this enzyme participates in one or more phases of host-parasite interaction, such as inflammation and soft tissue invasion. replacement of the single cysteine residue (c-192) with serine (c192s mutation) resulted in loss of detectable proteolytic activity against bovine casein, human  fibronectin, and the low-molecular-weight synthetic substrate 7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin. the c192s mutant molecule does not undergo autocatalytic processing of zymogen to mature form. taken together, these data support the hypothesis that c-192 participates in active-site formation and enzyme catalysis.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo activities of cs-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. the in vitro activity of cs-940 against gram-positive bacteria  was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. in particular, cs-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the mic at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cs-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. the activity of cs-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum  size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. cs-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against s. aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa, cs-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains  tested. against experimental pneumonia with k. pneumoniae in mice, cs-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. these results suggest that cs-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.

AB  == eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml,  enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, escherichia coli cs2(r+): 0.10 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, serratia marcescens:  1.56 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam  against gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria except p. aeruginosa. sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of pbps of s. aureus, e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. marcescens, even of p. aeruginosa. affinities of sulopenem to pbps-1 and -3 of s. aureus, pbp-2 of e. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (ipm). sulopenem generally has small ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to ia and iib types of beta-lactamases than ipm. no synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. however, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. the cells of e. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 mic of sulopenem. moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-is. sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a  concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration  8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == expression of active streptolysin o in escherichia coli as a maltose-binding-protein--streptolysin-o fusion protein. the n-terminal 70 amino acids are not required for hemolytic activity.
AB  == streptolysin 0 (slo) is the prototype of a family of cytolysins that consists of  proteins which bind to cholesterol and form very large transmembrane pores. structure/function studies on the pore-forming cytolysin slo have been complicated by the proteolytic inactivation of a substantial portion of recombinant slo (rslo) expressed in escherichia coli. to overcome this problem, translational fusions between the e. coli maltose-binding protein (mbp) gene and  slo were constructed, using the vectors pmal-p2 and pmal-c2. mbp-slo fusion proteins were degraded if secreted into the e. coli periplasm, but intact, soluble mbp-slo fusion proteins were produced at high levels in the cytoplasm. active slo with the expected n-terminus was separated from the mbp carrier by cleavage with factor xa. cleavage with plasmin or trypsin also yielded active, but slightly smaller forms of slo. surprisingly, uncleaved mbp-slo was also hemolytic and cytotoxic to human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. the mbp-slo fusion protein displayed equal activities to slo. sucrose density gradient analyses showed that the fusion protein assembled into polymers, and no difference in structure was discerned compared with polymers formed by native slo. these studies show that the n-terminal 70 residues of mature (secreted) slo  are not required for pore formation and that the n-terminus of the molecule is probably not inserted into the bilayer. in addition, they provide a simple means  for producing mutants for structure/function studies and highly purified slo for  use as a permeabilising reagent in cell biology research.

TI  == the role of tissue colonization and bacterial resistance in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == unsuccessful medical therapy for treatment of acute tonsillitis frequently results in onset of recurrent or chronic forms rendering surgical treatment necessary. we have studied some of the factors involved in the evolution of these chronic or recurrent forms and, in particular, the distribution of different bacterial strains in tonsillar tissue, their response to treatment with antibiotics and mechanisms of bacterial resistance. the distribution of bacterial flora (saprophytic and pathogenic) present on the surface of the tonsils, in the  crypts and in the tonsillar tissue was studied in a control population of 30 children (20 boys and 10 girls) aged between 2-13 years, all affected with chronic tonsillitis and submitted to tonsillectomy. the same study was performed  in a group of 80 sex and aged matched children, also presenting with chronic or recurrent tonsillitis and treated with amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or cefaclor or clarithromycin 72 h before surgery. the 80 subjects were randomly  divided into four groups so that each antibiotic was tested on 20 subjects. the distribution of the bacterial population on the surface of tonsillar tissue, in the crypts and in the deeper tonsillar tissue is of particular interest concerning the affinity of bacteria to the different tissue areas. in particular  the interaction between crypt and tonsillar core, which could be a factor involved in the process of worsening of bacterial infection in the tonsils, is evidenced. the four antibodies tested showed different abilities to eradicate infection: haemophilus influenzae was found to be the most resistant germ to antibiotic therapy and was thus the most frequent cause of recurrent infections.  the characteristics and the mechanisms of adherence and resistance to beta lactam antibiotics were also analysed.

TI  == molecular population genetic analysis of emerged bacterial pathogens: selected insights.
AB  == research in bacterial population genetics has increased in the last 10 years. population genetic theory and tools and related strategies have been used to investigate bacterial pathogens that have contributed to recent episodes of temporal variation in disease frequency and severity. a common theme demonstrated by these analyses is that distinct bacterial clones are responsible for disease outbreaks and increases in infection frequency. many of these clones are characterized by unique combinations of virulence genes or alleles of virulence genes. because substantial interclonal variance exists in relative virulence, molecular population genetic studies have led to the concept that the unit of bacterial pathogenicity is the clone or cell line. continued new insights into host parasite interactions at the molecular level will be achieved by combining clonal analysis of bacterial pathogens with large-scale comparative sequencing of virulence genes.

TI  == comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight european countries.
AB  == in this multicenter study conducted in eight european countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, five in germany, in the netherlands and switzerland, four in greece and spain, three in hungary and one in finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (sceptor system, bbl, heidelberg, germany) were used throughout all assays. the most frequently encountered species were: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid salmonella spp., enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus agalactiae, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter freundii, staphylococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, proteus  vulgaris, moraxella catarrhalis and shigella spp. the percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and european-wide with all the data available. for many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. however, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-g-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates in hungary and spain; some of the low-level penicillin-g-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. the high frequency of ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae isolates in spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. the penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.

TI  == mitogenicity of m5 protein extracted from streptococcus pyogenes cells is due to  streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin c and mitogenic factor mf.
AB  == m proteins of streptococcus pyogenes are virulence factors which impede phagocytosis, bind to many plasma proteins, and induce formation of cross-reactive autoimmune antibodies. recently, it has been reported that some m  proteins, extracted with pepsin from streptococci (pep m), are superantigens. one of these, pep m5, was investigated in detail and was shown to stimulate human t cells bearing v beta 2, v beta 4, and v beta 8. in the present study, we extracted and purified m5 protein by different biochemical methods from two m type 5 group a streptococcal strains. the crude extracts were fractionated by affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography. all fractions were tested in parallel for m protein by immunoblotting and for t-cell-stimulating activity. although several crude preparations of m5 protein were associated with  mitogenicity for v beta 2 and v beta 8 t cells, the m5 proteins, irrespective of  the extraction method, could be purified to the extent that they were no longer mitogenic. the mitogenic activity was not destroyed during the purification procedures but was found in fractions separated from m protein. in these fractions, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin c and mitogenic factor mf could be detected by protein blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. moreover, anti-m protein sera did not inhibit the mitogenic activity of crude extracts, but antisera which contained anti-streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin c antibodies showed inhibition. the inability of m5 protein to stimulate t cells was confirmed with recombinant pep m5 produced in escherichia coli. our data strongly suggest that the mitogenic activity in m protein preparations is caused by traces of streptococcal superantigens different from m protein.

AB  == hyaluronic acid is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating subunits of glucuronic acid and n-acetylglucosamine. it is synthesized  by the group a streptococcal membrane-associated enzyme hyaluronate synthase. in  previous reports, the locus required for expression of hyaluronic acid, the has operon, was identified and found to consist of two genes, hasa and hasb encoding  hyaluronate synthase and udp-glucose dehydrogenase, respectively. since a transcription terminator was not found at the end of hasb, it was the aim of this study to identify the remaining gene(s) in the has operon. by utilizing the tn1000 method of dna sequencing and inverse polymerase chain reaction, hasc, the  third gene in the has operon was shown to be 915 base pairs in length (304 amino  acids) and located 192 base pairs downstream of hasb. sequence similarities to other genes suggested that hasc encodes udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase. overexpression of hasc using isopropyl-1-thio-beta-d-galactopyranoside induction  of the t7 promoter in the pet translation system allowed for the production of bacterial extracts from escherichia coli that possessed increased udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity as compared to nondetectable levels in extracts with vector alone. in addition, expression of hasc resulted in a protein of approximately 36 kda as shown by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these data as well as complementation analysis of hasc in an e. coli galu mutant confirmed that hasc encodes udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase. finally, since sequence analysis identified a potential rho-independent transcription terminator at the 3-prime terminus of the gene, hasc is the third and probably the final gene in the has operon.

TI  == cloning, sequence analysis and expression of the group a streptococcal guab gene  encoding inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase.
AB  == inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (impdh) is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of purines. we cloned a group a streptococcal (gas) dna fragment containing an open reading frame similar to other bacterial guab genes encoding impdh. the gas guab consists of 1479 nucleotides encoding a protein of 493 amino  acids. expression of the gas guab in an escherichia coli guab mutant restored impdh activity, confirming the function of the gene product and demonstrating that the gas enzyme is active in a heterologous bacterial host. restriction mapping and southern hybridization analysis of gas chromosomal dna localized guab to a site approximately 5 kb from the hasa and hasb genes which encode enzymes necessary for hyaluronic acid capsule synthesis.

TI  == identification of a plasminogen-binding motif in pam, a bacterial surface protein.
AB  == surface-associated plasmin(ogen) may contribute to the invasive properties of various cells. analysis of plasmin(ogen)-binding surface proteins is therefore of interest. the n-terminal variable regions of m-like (ml) proteins from five different group a streptococcal serotypes (33, 41, 52, 53 and 56) exhibiting the  plasminogen-binding phenotype were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the  recombinant proteins all bound plasminogen with high affinity. the binding involved the kringle domains of plasminogen and was blocked by a lysine analogue, 6-aminohexanoic acid, indicating that lysine residues in the m-like proteins participate in the interaction. sequence analysis revealed that the proteins contain common 13-16-amino-acid tandem repeats, each with a single central lysine residue. experiments with fusion proteins and a 30-amino-acid synthetic peptide demonstrated that these repeats harbour the major plasminogen-binding site in the ml53 protein, as well as a binding site for the tissue-type plasminogen activator. replacement of the lysine in the first repeat with alanine reduced the plasminogen-binding capacity of the ml53 protein by 80%. the results precisely localize the binding domain in a plasminogen surface receptor, thereby providing  a unique ligand for the analysis of interactions between kringles and proteins with internal kringle-binding determinants.

AB  == transcription of the surface-associated virulence factors of the group a streptococcus (gas) streptococcus pyogenes, m protein (emm) and the c5a peptidase (scpa), is activated by a protein called mga (formerly mry or virr). to determine whether mga binds directly to the promoters of the genes it regulates, a protein  resulting from the fusion of mga to the c-terminal end of maltose-binding protein was purified from escherichia coli. specific binding to the promoter regions of the scpa and emm alleles of the type m6 gas strain jrs4 was demonstrated by electrophoresis of the dna-protein complex. competition studies showed that the region upstream of scpa bound mbp-mga with a slightly higher affinity than did the region upstream of emm. dnase i protection experiments identified a single 45-bp binding site immediately upstream of and overlapping the -35 region of both promoters. sequences homologous to the protected regions were found in the promoters of many emm, scp, and emm-like genes from strains of different serotypes of gas, and a consensus mga binding site was deduced.

AB  == study objective: we retrospectively examined the clinical utility of obtaining routine blood cultures before the administration of antibiotics in certain nonimmunosuppressed patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) admitted to  the hospital during 1991. design: retrospective review. setting: grady memorial hospital (a county hospital primarily serving inner-city atlanta). patients or participants: hospital discharge diagnosis listings identified 1,250 adults ( > or = 18 years old) with pneumonia. from this group of patients, we selected patients admitted to the hospital with (1) respiratory symptoms and a lobar infiltrate on chest radiograph that were present at the time of hospital admission, (2) two or more sets of blood cultures obtained within 48 h of hospital admission, and (3) absence of defined risk factors: hiv-related illness, malignancy, recent chemotherapy, steroid therapy, sickle cell disease, nursing home residence, or hospital stays within the past 14 days. measurements and results: five hundred seventeen patients (mean age, 52 years;: age range, 18 to 103 years) qualified. of these 517 patients, 25 patients (4.8%) had growth in blood cultures considered contaminants while 34 (6.6%) had blood cultures positive for the following pathogens: 29 streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 haemophilus  influenzae, and 1 streptococcus pyogenes, 1 escherichia coli. antibiotic therapy  was changed for 7 of the 34 patients with positive blood cultures (1.4% of study  patients). antibiotic regimens were altered in 48 additional patients based on sputum culture, poor clinical response, and allergic reactions. conclusions: few  blood cultures were positive for likely infecting organisms in adult patients with cap without defined underlying risk factors. furthermore, a total of $34,122 was spent on blood cultures at $66 per patient. in this carefully defined group of patients, blood cultures may have limited clinical utility and questionable cost-effectiveness.

TI  == different forms of streptolysin o produced by streptococcus pyogenes and by escherichia coli expressing recombinant toxin: cleavage by streptococcal cysteine protease.
AB  == to resolve apparent discrepancies in the literature, n-terminal sequences of the  active high- and low-molecular-weight (high- and low-m(r)) forms of native streptolysin o (nslo) purified from streptococcus pyogenes culture supernatants and of the similar-size high- and low-m(r) forms of recombinant slo (rslo) found  in the periplasm of escherichia coli expressing a cloned slo gene were determined. the high-m(r) forms of nslo and rslo are identical, reflecting removal of a 31-residue signal peptide, but the similar-size low-m(r) forms are very different. removal of c-terminal sequences by proteases in the e. coli periplasm produces an inactive low-m(r) form of rslo. in contrast, an active low-m(r) form of nslo is produced by proteolytic cleavage between the n-terminal  residues lys-77 and leu-78, which was shown to correspond to an extremely sensitive cleavage site for the pyrogenic exotoxin b-derived streptococcal cysteine protease.

TI  == identification and characterization of a bacteroides gene, csuf, which encodes an outer membrane protein that is essential for growth on chondroitin sulfate.
AB  == bacteroides thetaiotaomicron can utilize a variety of polysaccharides, including  charged mucopolysaccharides such as chondroitin sulfate (cs) and hyaluronic acid  (ha). since the enzymes (chondroitin lyases i and ii) that catalyze the first step in breakdown of cs and ha are located in the periplasm, we had proposed that the first step in utilization of these polysaccharides was binding to one or more outer membrane proteins followed by translocation into the periplasm, but no such outer membrane proteins had been shown to play a role in cs or ha utilization. previously we have isolated a transposon-generated mutant, cs4, which was unable  to grow on cs or ha but retained the ability to grow on disaccharide components of cs. this phenotype suggested that the mutation in cs4 either blocked the transport of the mucopolysaccharides into the periplasmic space or blocked the depolymerization of the mucopolysaccharides into disaccharides. we have mapped the cs4 mutation to a single gene, csuf, which is capable of encoding a protein of 1,065 amino acids and contains a consensus signal sequence. although csuf had  a predicted molecular weight and pi similar to those of chondroitin lyases, it did not show significant sequence similarity to the bacteroides chondroitin lyase ii, a proteus chondroitin abc lyase, or two hyaluronidases from clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes, nor was any cs-degrading enzyme activity  associated with csuf expression in bacteroides species or escherichia coli. the deduced amino acid sequence of csuf exhibited features suggestive of an outer membrane protein. we obtained antibodies to csuf and demonstrated that the protein is located in the outer membrane. this is the first evidence that a nonenzymatic outer membrane protein is essential for utilization of cs and ha.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of glycerine-ichthammol in otitis externa.
AB  == the clinical efficacy of glycerine-ichthammol in otitis externa may be due to an  anti-inflammatory action of ichthammol or a dehydrating effect of glycerine on the oedematous ear canal. its antimicrobial activity, if any, against the common  organisms in otitis externa is not well known. a study of the antibacterial property of glycerine-ichthammol as measured by a growth inhibition test and a modified cidal assay, showed inhibition of selected gram positive organisms (streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus) by ichthammol and glycerine-ichthammol combination, but only negligible antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. candida albicans was also weakly inhibited. as the activity against gram negative organisms is minimal, incorporation of an anti-gram negative antibiotic such as gentamicin in the glycerine-ichthammol compound to enhance its antibacterial spectrum is suggested.

TI  == third generation oral cephalosporins: comparative in vitro kinetics.
AB  == in order to provide additional data on the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefetamet-pivoxil against respiratory pathogens, we determined the bactericidal kinetics of this antibiotic in comparison to cefixime and ceftibuten against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae, e. coli, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. time-kill studies were performed by using concentrations equal to a x mic, and 4 x mic of the antibiotics tested and different inocula (10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) cfu/ml). the strains were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 degrees c and 1 ml samples were removed at regular intervals for viable count determination. the antibiotics were eliminated by serial ten-fold dilutions in physiological saline before plating. at 4 x mic of cefetamet and at 10(5) cfu/ml  inoculum the results were 99.9% killing or more of h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis at 4 h, and of e. coli and k. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h, and of e. coli and k. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h. at the same concentration of mic and with the same inoculum a 99.9% reduction was achieved against s. pneumoniae within 4 h and against s. pyogenes within 2 h with no regrowth at 24 h in both cases. similar results were obtained using 10(7) and 10(9) cfu/ml inocula. cefetamet had efficient killing activity even at lower concentrations. bactericidal kinetics of cefetamet favorably compare with those of cefixime and ceftibuten. the efficient  bactericidal activity of cefetamet-pivoxil indicates a clinical role for this new oral cephalosporin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

(b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

AB  == the serum opacity factor (sof) is a group a streptococcal protein that induces opacity of mammalian serum. the serum opacity factor 22 gene (sof22) from an m type 22 strain was cloned from an embl4 library by screening for plaques exhibiting serum opacity activity. dna sequencing yielded an open reading frame of 3,075 bp. its deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein of 1,025 residues with a molecular weight of 112,735, a size that approximates that of the sof22 protein isolated from both the original streptococcal strain and escherichia coli harboring the cloned sof22 gene. the molecule is composed of three domains: an n-terminal domain responsible for the opacity reaction (opacity domain), a repeat domain with fibronectin-binding (fn-binding) activity, and a c-terminal cell attachment domain. the c-terminal end of sof22 is characterized by a hexameric lpxtgx motif, an adjacent hydrophobic region, and a charged c terminus, which are the hallmarks of cell-bound surface proteins found on nearly all gram-positive bacteria. immediately upstream of this cell anchor region, sof22 contains four tandem repeat sequence blocks, flanked by prolinerich segments. the repeats share up to 50% identity with a repeated motif found in other group a streptococcal fn-binding proteins and exhibit fn-binding activity, as shown by subcloning experiments. according to deletion analysis, the opacity domain is confined to the region n terminal to the repeat segment. thus, sof22 is unique among the known fn-binding proteins from gram-positive bacteria in containing an independent module with a defined function in its n-terminal portion. southern blot analysis with a probe from this n-terminal region indicates that the opacity domain of sof varies extensively among different sof-producing m types.

AB  == in 5 mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin g, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime,  cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. ten centers in italy, 4 centers in greece, 3 centers in spain, and 1 center in lebanon and saudi arabia contributed  to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (sceptor, bbl, heidelberg, frg). the most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (n = 1267), proteus mirabilis (n = 843), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric salmonella spp. (n = 629), enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), citrobacter freundii (n = 383), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 246), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and shigella spp. (n = 185). statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. the penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the  gram-positive cocci, exceeding the mic90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. regarding the gram-negatives (above all klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (mic90 = 1 mg/l). regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. there was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae isolates (mic90 = 2 mg/l). by far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == molecular, genetic, and topological characterization of o-antigen chain length regulation in shigella flexneri.
AB  == the rfb region of shigella flexneri encodes the proteins required to synthesize the o-antigen component of its cell surface lipopolysaccharides (lps). we have previously reported that a region adjacent to rfb was involved in regulating the  length distribution of the o-antigen polysaccharide chains (d. f. macpherson et al., mol. microbiol. 5:1491-1499, 1991). the gene responsible has been identified in escherichia coli o75 (called rol [r. a. batchelor et al., j. bacteriol. 173:5699-5704, 1991]) and in e. coli o111 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain lt2 (called cld [d. a. bastin et al., mol. microbiol. 5:2223-2231, 1991]). through a combination of subcloning, deletion, and transposon insertion analysis, we have identified a gene adjacent to the s. flexneri rfb region which encodes a protein of 36 kda responsible for the length  distribution of o-antigen chains in lps as seen on silver-stained sodium dodecyl  sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. dna sequence analysis identified an open reading frame (orf) corresponding to the rol gene. the corresponding protein was almost identical in sequence to the rol protein of e. coli o75 and was highly homologous to the functionally identical cld proteins of e. coli o111 and s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2. these proteins, together with orf o349 adjacent to rfe,  had almost identical hydropathy plots which predict membrane-spanning segments at the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends and a hydrophilic central region. we isolated a number of tnphoa insertions which inactivated the rol gene, and the fusion end points were determined. the phoa+ rol::phoa fusion proteins had phoa fused within the large hydrophilic central domain of rol. these proteins were located in the whole-membrane fraction, and extraction with triton x-100 indicated a cytoplasmic membrane location. this finding was supported by sucrose  density gradient fractionation of the whole-cell membranes and of e. coli maxicells expressing l-[35s]methionine-labelled rol protein. hence, we interpret  these data to indicate that the rol protein is anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane via its amino- and carboxy-terminal ends but that the majority of the protein is located in the periplasmic space. to confirm that rol is responsible for the effects on o-antigen chain length observed with the cloned rfb genes in e. coli k-12, it was mutated in s. flexneri by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cartridge. the resulting strains produced lps with o antigens of nonmodal chain length, thereby confirming the function of the rol gene product. we propose a model for the function of rol protein in which it acts as a type of  molecular chaperone to facilitate the interaction of the o-antigen ligase (rfal)  with the o-antigen polymerase (rfc) and polymerized, acyl carrier lipid-linked, o-antigen chains. analysis of the dna sequence of the region identified a number  of orfs corresponding to the well-known gnd and hisie genes. the rol gene was located immediately downstream of two orfs with sequence similarity to the gene encoding udpglucose dehydrogenase (hasb) of streptococcus pyogenes. the orfs arise because of a deletion or frameshift mutation within the gene we have termed udg (for udpglucose dehydrogenase).

TI  == detection of aerolysin gene in aeromonas strains isolated from drinking water, fish and foods by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique was used to assay the presence of the aerolysin gene in a total of 89 aeromonas hydrophila and a. sobria strains isolated from drinking water, fish and foods. these strains were also characterized for the production of virulence factors such as haemolysin, protease and cytotoxin. the primers used in the pcr targeted a 209-bp fragment of the aer gene coding for the beta-haemolysin and detected template dna only in haemolytic a. hydrophila strains. the cell-free culture supernatants of these aerolysin-positive a. hydrophila strains were also cytotoxic to the hela and mccoy cells. the haemolytic a. sobria and non-haemolytic a. hydrophila were consistently negative in the pcr assay. primer specificity was determined in the  pcr by using a control haemolytic escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes and a  restriction endonuclease assay. the pcr clearly identified the aerolysin-producing strains of a. hydrophila and may have application as a rapid  species-specific virulence test.

TI  == expression of the arp protein, a member of the m protein family, is not sufficient to inhibit phagocytosis of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == many streptococcus pyogenes immunoglobulin-binding proteins have structural similarities to the antiphagocytic m protein, including the well-known c repeats. one of these molecules is the immunoglobulin a-binding protein arp, which is expressed by a serotype 4 strain for which no antiphagocytic m protein has yet been described. we expressed arp4 in an s. pyogenes strain from which the structural gene for the m protein has been deleted and found that arp4 is not sufficient to inhibit phagocytosis.

TI  == revised sequence of the porphyromonas gingivalis prtt cysteine protease/hemagglutinin gene: homology with streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b/streptococcal proteinase.
AB  == the prtt gene from porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 53977 was previously isolated from an escherichia coli clone possessing trypsinlike protease activity upstream  of a region encoding hemagglutinin activity (j. otogoto and h. kuramitsu, infect. immun. 61;117-123, 1993). subsequent molecular analysis of this gene has revealed that the prtt protein is larger than originally reported, encompassing the hemagglutination region. results of primer extension experiments indicate that the translation start site was originally misidentified. an alternate open reading frame of nearly 2.7 kb, which encodes a protein in the size range of 96 to 99 kda, was identified. in vitro transcription-translation experiments confirm this size, and northern (rna) blot experiments indicate that the protease is translated from a 3.3-kb mrna. searching the embl protein database revealed that  the amino acid sequence of the revised prtt is similar to sequences of two related proteins from streptococcus pyogenes. prtt is 31% identical and 73% similar over 401 amino acids to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b. in addition,  it is 36% identical and 74% similar over 244 amino acids with streptococcal proteinase, which is closely related to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b. the similarity is particularly high at the putative active site of streptococcal proteinase, which is similar to the active sites of the family of cysteine proteases. thus, we conclude that prtt is a 96- to 99-kda cysteine protease and hemagglutinin with significant similarity to streptococcal enzymes.

TI  == characterization and distribution of insertion sequence is1239 in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the human pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pyogenes causes pharyngitis, acute rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis and toxic-shock-like syndrome. the bacterium  synthesizes several extracellular products, including the recently described streptococcal superantigen ssa, a molecule that shares considerable homology with several staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins. while studying allelic variation at the ssa locus, six isolates expressing serotypes m4, m23, m33, m41, m43, and provisional type pt4854, were identified that had pcr products about 40-bp larger than expected, and one isolate (m15) had an amplified fragment that was more than 1-kb larger than expected. all six isolates have a 34-bp insert located 103 bp 5' of the ssa start codon. the larger product is a result of a 1110-bp insertion at  the analogous location. the complementary strand of this insert has a 981-bp open reading frame that potentially encodes a 326-amino-acid polypeptide with substantial homology to the escherichia coli is30 transposase. results of southern blot analysis showed that at least twelve copies of the sequence are present in the serotype m15 s. pyogenes isolate. this element, designated is1239, is the first simple insertion sequence described in group-a streptococci. results of pcr screening showed that 26 of 78 (33%) s. pyogenes isolates expressing distinct m protein serotypes contained sequences with homology to is1239, which means that the element is widely distributed in the species.

TI  == development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae dna.
AB  == in this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay to detect the presence of streptococcus pneumoniae genomic dna. the target dna sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the s. pneumoniae dna polymerase i gene (pol i). pcr products of pure cultures of a set  of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing s. pneumoniae. we were able to detect 2 fg of purified s. pneumoniae dna. there were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas spp. nontypeable h. influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococcus pyogenes. the addition of edta and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the pcr reaction mixture inhibited the pcr  assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to pcr reaction mixture did not  interfere with the ability to detect the presence of s. pneumoniae dna.

TI  == sequencing of genes within the vir regulon of streptococcus pyogenes type m15--an opacity factor-positive serotype with low opacity factor expression.
AB  == major virulence determinants of group a streptococci, such as m-protein, immunoglobulin fc-receptors (fcra, emml) and c5a peptidase, appear to be genetically co-regulated, their genes being located within a vir regulon. we studied the organization of these genes in a group a, type m15 strain of streptococcus pyogenes, previously defined as of-, by hybridization analysis of chromosomal dna and of an s. pyogenes gene library in escherichia coli, and by gene sequencing. within the vir regulon, in addition to the virr and scpa genes,  three so-called emm-related genes were found: fcra, emml and enn. whereas igg fc-binding proteins were encoded by fcra and emml, the product of enn was not identified. the presence of three emm-related genes in this region is reminescent of vir regulon organization in of+ rather than of- strains as earlier defined by  others. furthermore, analysis of the deduced product of the emml gene showed deletions and amino acid substitutions within the pgts-rich domain and membrane anchor, which thus resembles corresponding products of of+ rather than of- strains. in view of these findings, the opacity factor (of) activity of the strain was tested using growth supernatant, with negative outcome. however, a concentrated sds cell extract revealed definite of activity. one of two other type m15 reference strains also showed definite of activity in sds extracts. we therefore propose that type m15 strains belong to the of+ category but often show low levels of expression of of.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of a fibronectin/fibrinogen-binding protein from group a streptococci.
AB  == lipoteichoic acid and several streptococcal proteins have been reported to bind fibronectin (fn) or fibrinogen (fgn), which may serve as host receptors. we searched for such proteins by screening a library of genes from m type 5 group a  streptococci cloned into escherichia coli. lysates of clones were probed with biotinylated fn and biotinylated fgn. one clone expressed a 54-kda protein that reacted with fn and fgn. the protein, termed fbp54, was purified and used to immunize rabbits. anti-fbp54 serum reacted with purified, recombinant fbp54 and with a protein of similar electrophoretic mobility in extracts of m type 5, 6, and 24 streptococci. anti-fbp54 serum also reacted with 5 of 15 strains of intact, live streptococci, suggesting that fbp54 may be a surface antigen. southern blot analysis confirmed that the gene is found in group a streptococci but not in staphylococcus aureus or e. coli. the cloned gene was sequenced and contained an open reading frame encoding a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 54,186. partial amino acid sequencing of purified fbp54 confirmed that  this open reading frame encoded the protein. as determined by utilizing fusion proteins containing truncated forms of fbp54, the primary fn/fgn-binding domain appears to be contained in residues 1 to 89. these data suggest that fbp54 may be a surface protein of streptococci that reacts with both fn and fgn and therefore  may participate in the adhesion of group a streptococci to host cells.

(1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 19181-19184]. we have now generated two polyclonal monospecific antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to portions of the deduced protein. both antibodies recognize a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000 either from wild-type streptococcus pyogenes  or from escherichia coli containing the cloned gene on a plasmid. immobilized affinity-purified antibody depleted ha synthase activity from functional detergent extracts of streptococcal membranes in a specific fashion. the immobilized protein displayed ha synthase activity, and hasa was the major bound  polypeptide. the recombinant ha synthase behaves identically to that from streptococci, with respect to sugar nucleotide specificity and polysaccharide production. only the authentic sugar nucleotides udp-glucuronic acid and udp-n-acetylglucosamine support ha polymerization. the recombinant enzyme elongates ha in a processive manner and rapidly produces polymers on the order of > or = 5 x 10(6) da at rates of about 10-30 monosaccharides/s at three times the  apparent km of substrates.

TI  == [bacteriological and clinical studies of biapenem (l-627) in pediatrics].
AB  == bacteriological and clinical studies in the pediatric field have been performed on biapenem (l-627), a newly-developed carbapenem antibiotic, and the following results were obtained. 1. in the pharmacokinetic study, the plasma concentration  of l-627 showed dose-dependant change: cmax was 14.6 micrograms/ml and auc was 15.4 micrograms.hr/ml with the administration of 6 mg/kg, while cmax was 49.2 micrograms/ml and auc was 60.1 micrograms.hr/ml with the administration of 12 mg/kg. after the administration of 6 mg/kg, the urinary concentration reached maximum within 2 hours and the cumulative urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours was 49.4%. 2. antibacterial activities of l-627 against 27 strains of clinical isolates were determined. mics of l-627 against such gram-positive cocci as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes were sufficiently low, and those against such gram-negative rods as haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli and bordetella pertussis were satisfactory and as low as those of imipenem or ceftazidime. 3. clinical efficacies of l-627 were evaluated in 36 cases of bacterial infections. the overall efficacy rate was 100%, and excellent responses in 26 cases and good in 10 cases were obtained. as  for bacteriological efficacies, all strains except 1 of b. pertussis were eradicated and a high eradication rate of 96.6% was obtained. 4. no side effects  were observed in 37 evaluated cases. as abnormal laboratory test results, eosinophilia was noted in 2 cases (5.4%), but they returned to normal values rapidly after the drug was discontinued. from these results, it has been concluded that l-627 is a safe and effective drug to be used in treatment of pediatric infectious diseases.

TI  == udp-glucose dehydrogenase from bovine liver: primary structure and relationship to other dehydrogenases.
AB  == the primary structure of bovine liver udp-glucose dehydrogenase (udpgdh), a hexameric, nad(+)-linked enzyme, has been determined at the protein level. the 52-kda subunits are composed of 468 amino acid residues, with a free n-terminus and a ser/asn microhetergeneity at one position. the sequence shares 29.6% positional identity with gdp-mannose dehydrogenase from pseudomonas, confirming a similarity earlier noted between active site peptides. this degree of similarity  is comparable to the 31.1% identity vs. the udpgdh from type a streptococcus. database searching also revealed similarities to a hypothetical sequence from salmonella typhimurium and to "udp-n-acetyl-mannosaminuronic acid dehydrogenase"  from escherichia coli. pairwise identities between bovine udpgdh and each of these sequences were all in the range of approximately 26-34%. multiple alignment of all 5 sequences indicates common ancestry for these 4-electron-transferring enzymes. there are 27 strictly conserved residues, including a cysteine residue at position 275, earlier identified by chemical modification as the expected catalytic residue of the second half-reaction (conversion of udp-aldehydoglucose  to udp-glucuronic acid), and 2 lysine residues, at positions 219 and 338, one of  which may be the expected catalytic residue for the first half-reaction (conversion of udp-glucose to udp-aldehydoglucose). a gxgxxg pattern characteristic of the coenzyme-binding fold is found at positions 11-16, close to the n-terminus as with "short-chain" alcohol dehydrogenases.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == an m-like protein from streptococcus pyogenes type m15 strain ef1949 (emml15) was cloned in escherichia coli and sequenced. recombinant emml15 protein revealed a unique binding pattern for human igg subclasses not described previously. comparative analysis of the emml15 amino acid sequence with those of other m-like proteins of opacity factor positive (of+) serotypes and protein h, and igg receptor from of- serotype m1, showed that igg-binding proteins with common binding of igg3 were closely related and distinct from streptococcal igg receptors not binding igg3. thus, the ig-binding proteins from s. pyogenes were subdivided into two main categories according to binding pattern, protein structure, and gene location.

TI  == m1 protein and protein h: iggfc- and albumin-binding streptococcal surface proteins encoded by adjacent genes.
AB  == m1 protein and protein h are surface proteins simultaneously present at the surface of certain strains of streptococcus pyogenes, important pathogenic bacteria in humans. the present study concerns the structure, protein-binding properties and relationship between these two molecules. the gene encoding m1 protein (emm1) was found immediately upstream of the protein h gene (sph). both genes were preceded by a promoter region. comparison of the sequences revealed a  high degree of similarity in the signal peptides, the c repeats located in the central parts of the molecules and in the c-terminal cell-wall-attached regions,  whereas the n-terminal sequences showed no significant similarity. protein h has  affinity for the fc region of igg antibodies. also m1 protein, isolated from streptococcal culture supernatants or from escherichia coli expressing emm1, was  found to bind human iggfc. when tested against polyclonal igg from eight other mammalian species, m1 protein and protein h both showed affinity for baboon, rabbit and pig igg. m1 protein also reacted with guinea-pig igg, whereas both streptococcal proteins were negative in binding experiments with rat, mouse, bovine and horse igg. the two proteins were also tested against other members of  the immunoglobulin super family: human igm, iga, igd, ige, beta 2-microglobulin,  and major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class-i and class-ii antigens. m1 protein showed no affinity for any of these molecules whereas protein h reacted with mhc class-ii antigens. m1 protein is known to bind albumin and fibrinogen also. the binding sites for these two plasma proteins and for iggfc were mapped to different sites on m1 protein. thus albumin bound to the c repeats and iggfc to a region (s) immediately n-terminal of the c repeats. finally, fibrinogen bound further towards the n-terminus but close to the iggfc-binding site. on the  fibrinogen molecule, fragment d was found to mediate binding to m1 protein. the iggfc-binding region of m1 protein showed no similarity to that of protein h. still, competitive binding experiments demonstrated that the two streptococcal proteins bound to overlapping sites on iggfc.

TI  == cloning and sequence analysis of a gene encoding a 67-kilodalton myosin-cross-reactive antigen of streptococcus pyogenes reveals its similarity with class ii major histocompatibility antigens.
AB  == the group a streptococcal sequela acute rheumatic fever (arf) has been associated with immunological cross-reactivity between streptococcal and heart proteins. to  identify streptococcus pyogenes genes that encode a myosin cross-reactive antigen(s) recognized by arf sera, a genomic library from an emm deletion strain  (t28/51/4) was screened with a single arf serum. a positively identified lambda embl3 clone (t.2.18) produced a protein which reacted with myosin-specific antibodies affinity purified from individual arf sera. the recombinant protein was initially estimated to be 60 kda in size by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; however, upon sequence analysis it had a molecular mass equivalent to 67 kda. sera from patients with streptococcal  infections, acute glomerulonephritis, and arf were reactive with the recombinant  67-kda protein. however, individual sera from healthy persons were negative or demonstrated low levels of reactivity with the 67-kda antigen. the gene encoding  the 67-kda myosin-cross-reactive antigen was subcloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined by using a combined strategy of dna sequencing of the cloned gene and n-terminal amino acid sequencing of the protein expressed in escherichia coli. the amino-terminal sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of an open reading frame was identical to that determined from the 67-kda protein expressed in e. coli. the gene encoded 590 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 67,381. no cleavable signal peptide was detected with the 67-kda protein expressed in e. coli. the deduced amino acid sequence of  the 67-kda protein did not exhibit significant similarity to any known streptococcal proteins. however, it was found to be 19% identical and 62% similar over 151 amino acid residues to the beta chain of mouse major histocompatibility  complex class ii antigen (i-au). similar degrees of homology to the beta chains of other murine and human class ii haplotypes were found. mouse anti-ia sera reacted with the recombinant 67-kda protein about five times more strongly than normal mouse sera in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. southern hybridization experiments using a probe for the gene encoding the 67-kda protein  showed that the gene was present and conserved among pathogenic groups a, c, and  g of streptococci. these data suggest that the streptococcal protein, which is distinct from the m protein, may have structural features in common with the beta chain of the class ii antigens, as well as myosin, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of streptococcal infections.

TI  == a group a streptococcal enn protein potentially resulting from intergenomic recombination exhibits atypical immunoglobulin-binding characteristics.
AB  == the gene encoding the enn protein (enn) of the m untypeable group a streptococcal (gas) strain 64/14 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, cloned into the expression vector pjla602 and expressed in escherichia coli dh5 alpha. unlike other gas-enn proteins, which exhibit iga-binding activity, the recombinant enn enn64/14 protein reacted preferentially with human igg3. the 1050 bp open reading frame comprising the enn64/14 gene was completely sequenced. the region of the gene encoding the signal peptide and the c-terminus exhibited > 95% homology to corresponding sections of other enn genes. the region of enn64/14 encoding the n-terminus of the mature enn protein was found to be highly homologous to the corresponding section of the gene encoding the m-like protein of gas serotype m9  (emml9). the recombinant protein encoded by emml9 was found to react with all four human igg subclasses. about 30% of the 1152 bp open reading frame of emml9 encoding the n-terminus was found to display > 90% homology to the corresponding  section of enn64/14 but was < 50% homologous in the remainder of the gene sequence. the functional analysis of the subcloned n-terminal section of emml9 demonstrated a polypeptide exhibiting selective binding to human igg3. these findings suggested that enn64/14 was a hybrid gene formed by recombination of an  enn gene and an emml9 gene. the putative recombinational event could have involved a set of flanking 7 bp direct repeats. since enn64/14 and emml9 are genes from different phylogenetic lineages of gas, this report provides evidence  that intergenomic recombinations between different types of gas genes can occur and could lead to hybrid proteins with unique ig-binding characteristics.

TI  == streptokinase activates plasminogen bound to human group c and g streptococci through m-like proteins.
AB  == an ability to interact with plasminogen or plasmin could provide micro-organisms  with a mechanism for invasion. thus, group a, c and g streptococci secrete streptokinase which binds and activates plasminogen. some streptococci also express surface structures which bind plasminogen without causing its activation. plasminogen-binding surface proteins were extracted from one group c and one group g streptococcal isolate. both proteins were found to bind plasmin, fibrinogen and serum albumin in addition to plasminogen. gene fragments encoding  the streptococcal proteins were amplified by pcr and were subsequently cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. dna sequence determination revealed for both genes open reading frames encoding proteins which contained repetitive domains and a carboxyl-terminal unrepeated region that were typical of m and m-like proteins. though the amino-terminal regions of the group c and g streptococcal proteins demonstrated a rather high overall similarity between themselves, they were not similar to the variable regions of other m-like proteins with one exception: there was a 46% identity between the first 22 amino acids of the group g streptococcal protein and the corresponding sequence of pam, the plasminogen-binding m-like protein of type m53 group a streptococci. like the proteins extracted from the streptococci, the recombinant proteins bound plasminogen, fibrinogen and albumin. the three plasma proteins bound to separate  sites on the streptococcal m-like proteins. plasminogen bound by the group c and  g streptococcal proteins was readily activated by streptokinase, providing evidence for a functional link between the secreted plasminogen-activator and proteins exposed on the bacterial surface.

TI  == molecular characterization of protein sir, a streptococcal cell surface protein that binds both immunoglobulin a and immunoglobulin g.
AB  == cell surface proteins that bind to the fc part of immunoglobulin (ig) a and/or igg are expressed by many strains of the group a streptococcus, an important human pathogen. two extensively characterized proteins in this group of molecules are protein arp that preferentially binds iga and protein h that binds igg. in addition, recent work has shown that many group a streptococcal strains express a novel type of fc-binding protein, designated protein sir, that binds both iga and igg. protein sir22, the molecule expressed by a strain of serotype m22, has now been purified and characterized after expression of the cloned gene in escherichia coli. dot-blot analysis with a large number of purified monoclonal igs showed that protein sir22 reacted with 19 out of 20 iga proteins and with 19  out of 24 igg proteins. the affinity constants for the reactions between protein  sir22 and ig were determined to be 7.0 x 10(8) m-1 for serum iga, 2.4 x 10(8 m-1  for secretory iga, and 7.8 x 10(8) m-1 for igg. inhibition experiments showed that the bindings of iga and igg to protein sir22 were mutually exclusive, indicating shared or contiguous binding sites. analysis of the sequence of the sir22 gene indicated a gene product with 365 amino acid residues, including a 41-residue signal peptide. the processed form of the protein, 324 residues, has a calculated m(r) of 37,168. deletion analysis of the sir22 gene showed that a 156-residue nh2-terminal fragment of protein sir22 retained the ability to bind both iga and igg. the overall organization of protein sir22 is similar to that of the iga-binding protein arp and the igg-binding protein h. all three of these proteins are members of the m protein family and have a central repeat region of  the c type.

AB  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. the advantages of in vitro activity of fk037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (mic90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (h-mrsa), (3) a strong activity against enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (mic90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for escherichia coli,  0.1 microgram/ml for streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for haemophilus influenzae and proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis and moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for c. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant s. aureus (l-mrsa), enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for h-mrsa and serratia marcescens.  fk037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except mrsa, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except p. vulgaris and/or m. catarrhalis. the increase in mics of fk037 against 2 l-mrsa strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. fk037 was highly bactericidal against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa at the mic or higher. fk037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against h-mrsa and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. against the other strains, fk037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa. transmission electron microscopic  studies revealed that fk037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in mrsa after 4 h incubation.

TI  == localization of immunoglobulin a-binding sites within m or m-like proteins of group a streptococci.
AB  == many strains of group a streptococci are capable of binding human immunoglobulin  a (iga) by a nonimmune mechanism. m or m-like proteins constitute a family of structurally diverse molecules which form surface fibrillae, and some of the m or m-like protein forms are responsible for the iga-binding activity. in this report, the binding site for iga is localized within two structurally distinct m  or m-like proteins, ml2.2 and arp4. apart from those structural domains which are common to all m and m-like proteins, ml2.2 and arp4 lack significant levels of amino acid sequence homology, with the exception of a short segment (alxgenxdlr)  located at residues 21 to 30 of the mature ml2.2 protein. recombinant fusion polypeptides containing portions of the ml2.2 and arp4 proteins were expressed in escherichia coli and tested for binding of human myeloma iga. a 58-residue polypeptide containing residues 14 to 71 of ml2.2 bound human iga. the iga-binding site of arp4 could be localized to a 53-residue polypeptide containing residues 43 to 95, which encompasses the alxgenxdlr consensus sequence of arp4 positioned at residues 50 to 59. site-specific mutagenesis at three codons within the alxgenxdlr coding sequence of both the ml2.2 and arp4 recombinant polypeptides leads to a loss in iga-binding activity. thus, the alxgenxdlr consensus sequence is essential for the nonimmune binding of iga by both ml2.2 and arp4. however, the failure to bind iga by polypeptides which partially overlap the 58- and 53-residue iga-binding polypeptides of ml2.2 and arp4, yet contain the alxgenxdlr consensus sequence, strongly suggests that flanking regions are also critical for iga binding. in summary, the results indicate that common functional domains bearing significant sequence homology are distributed within regions of m or m-like molecules that are otherwise highly divergent.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

AB  == the gene pcp, encoding pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (pcp), from pseudomonas fluorescens mfo was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. this sequence contains a unique open reading frame (pcp) coding for a polypeptide of 213 amino acids (m(r) 22,441) which has significant homology to the pcps from streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus amyloliquefaciens. comparison of the four pcp sequences revealed two highly conserved motifs which may be involved in the active site of these enzymes. the cloned pcp from p. fluorescens was purified to homogeneity and appears to exist as a dimer. this enzyme displays a michaelis constant of 0.21 mm with l-pyroglutamyl-beta-naphthylamide as the substrate and an absolute substrate specificity towards n-terminal pyroglutamyl residues. studies of inhibition by chemical compounds revealed that the cysteine and histidine residues are essential for enzyme activity. from their conservation in the four enzyme sequences, the cys-144 and his-166 amino acids are proposed to form a part of the active site of these enzymes.

AB  == cefditoren pivoxil (cdtr-pi, me1207) granules, a new oral cephem, was given to pediatric patients with infectious diseases to evaluate antibacterial activities  against clinical isolates, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and safety, and the following results were obtained. 1. in sensitivity test, 30 strains were used comprised of 5 species, isolated from the patients before administered with cdtr-pi. against staphylococcus aureus, mics of 7 agents, cefditoren (cdtr), cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram, cefotiam, cefpodoxime and methicillin, were determined. against other 4 species, mics of the above 6 agents excluding methicillin were determined. among gram-positive cocci tested, the mics of cdtr were 0.78 to 100 micrograms/ml or higher against s. aureus (16 strains), < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against streptococcus pyogenes (5 strains), and 0.10 or 0.39 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae (2 strains). these values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems and of methicillin. among gram-negative rods tested, the mics of cdtr were < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against haemophilus influenzae (3 strains), and 0.10 or 0.20 microgram/ml against escherichia coli (4 strains). also, these values were equal to or lower than those of conventional cephems. 2. when cdtr-pi granules was orally administered in a single dose of 3.0 mg/kg to 1 patient and that of 6.0 mg/kg to 2 patients 30 minutes after meal, plasma cdtr concentrations reached their maxima 4 hours after administration in the former patient and 1 or 2 hours after administration in the latter 2 patients, and the peak plasma concentrations were 1.91, 3.46 and 4.82 micrograms/ml with half-lives of 1.01, 0.81 and 0.88 hours and aucs of 8.62, 9.89 and 13.52 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. dose-dependency was observed for the peak plasma concentrations and aucs also tended to depend on dose excepting for the auc in one 6.0 mg/kg patient. 3. the urinary concentrations in the above patients reached their peaks at 4 to 6 hours after administration in one 3.0 mg/kg patient and at 4 to 6 hours and 2 to 4 hours after administration in two 6.0 mg/kg patients, and the corresponding values were 126.0, 195.0 and 234.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. recovery rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 18.2, 24.6 and 21.3%, respectively. 4. of 53 patients with 13 diseases, cdtr-pi was clinically judged "excellent" in 32 (60.4%) and "good" in 21 (39.6%), showing excellent efficacy. 5. bacteriologically, excellent results were obtained, i.e., 29 (96.7%) of 30 strains from 5 species were eradicated. 6.  side effects were observed in none of the 54 patients treated.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (cxm-ax) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from january to september of 1990 and 1993. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were  obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic80 of cxm were equal to or lower against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes, except for streptococcus pneumoniae, mic80 which was slightly higher. 2. mic90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephem-resistant e. coli and klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant h. influenzae and n. gonorrhoeae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. from the nature of mrsa detected in those situations mrsa appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. mic90 against strains obtained from  patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. therefore, the determination of mic90  is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. antimicrobial activities of cxm against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. however, mic of cxm as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of cxm against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., h. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.

TI  == comparison of peptidoglycan-polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide stimulation of  kupffer cells to produce tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1.
AB  == endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is a cell wall polymer from gram-negative bacteria that stimulates kupffer cell release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1. another bacterial cell wall polymer in both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms is peptidoglycan-polysaccharide. lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan-polysaccharide exist together in the intestinal lumen and can cross the intestinal mucosa, enter the portal vein and activate kupffer cells. the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of lipopolysaccharide stimulation and peptidoglycan-polysaccharide stimulation of kupffer cells on release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1. both bacterial polymers caused maximum tumor necrosis factor-alpha release from kupffer cells after incubation for 4 to 8 hr. maximum tumor necrosis factor-alpha release induced by 400 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide was 704 +/- 258 pg/ml, compared with 329 +/- 91 pg/ml tumor necrosis factor-alpha after 100 micrograms/ml peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (p < 0.001). polymyxin b blocked lipopolysaccharide  stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha by 95% +/- 5% but blocked peptidoglycan-polysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha by 30% +/- 14% (p < 0.001). repeat incubation of kupffer cells with lipopolysaccharide after prior lipopolysaccharide incubation induced low tumor necrosis factor-alpha release (tolerance). repeat incubation with peptidoglycan-polysaccharide induced  no tolerance to tumor necrosis factor-alpha release. incubation of lipopolysaccharide plus peptidoglycan-polysaccharide released less tumor necrosis factor-alpha than did each polymer used alone, but this inhibition was prevented  by indomethacin. dibutyryl cyclic amp, prostaglandin e1, prostaglandin e2 and the adenosine a2-receptor agonist n-ethylcarboxyamideadenosine inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha release by 83%, 97%, 90% and 94%, respectively, but inhibited peptidoglycan-polysaccharide-stimulated  tumor necrosis factor-alpha release by 52%, 60%, 45% and 51%, respectively (p < 0.001 for each). this indicates that intracellular signaling pathways differ for  lipopolysaccharide-stimulated and peptidoglycan-polysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha release. after incubation for 8 and 24 hr, 100 micrograms/ml peptidoglycan-polysaccharide had induced significantly more interleukin-1 release from cultured kupffer cells than had 400 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (p < 0.001). lipopolysaccharide induced tolerance to interleukin-1 release after repeat incubation, but peptidoglycan-polysaccharide caused no tolerance. these studies show that peptidoglycan-polysaccharide, a ubiquitous bacterial cell wall polymer, shares several proinflammatory properties with lipopolysaccharide but that there are differences that may have pathophysiological significance.

AB  == a survey aimed at assessing the ability of ceftibuten, a new oral third-generation cephalosporin, to eradicate in vitro selected bacterial pathogens was conducted in 1991 in 17 microbiology laboratories evenly distributed in italy. over 8700 organisms collected from in- and outpatients affected mainly by respiratory and urinary tract infections were analyzed. this collection of bacteria did not include staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas and other oxidative species naturally refractory to the action of most antibiotics employed. susceptibility to ceftibuten, cefaclor, cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cotrimoxazole and erythromycin was assessed using a standardized agar-diffusion method. production of beta-lactamases was confirmed by the nitrocefin test. among the microorganisms studied e. coli (32.1%) prevailed, followed by p. mirabilis (17.1%), k. pneumoniae (10.9%), s. pyogenes (6.6%), e. cloacae (5.1%), serratia spp. (4.5%), enterobacter spp. (4.2%), h. influenzae (3.6%), s. pneumoniae (2.2%) and m. catarrhalis (2%). within this group of pathogens amoxicillin resistance, often mediated by synthesis of beta-lactamases, was widely diffused (46.2%). the overall inhibitory activity of the drugs tested decreased as follows: ceftibuten (90.4%), cefuroxime (80.4%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (77.4%), cotrimoxazole (75.3%), cefaclor (72.6%), amoxicillin (53.8%) and erythromycin (32.8%). when the efficacy of the antibiotics was assessed against the collection of respiratory isolates producing beta-lactamases only ceftibuten maintained the same overall potency manifested against the general population while the comparative agents were far less effective. the results of this national survey indicate that, given the low incidence of resistance among the most prevalent causative agents of respiratory  and urinary tract infections, ceftibuten can be safely used at present in the empiric therapy of these conditions especially when they occur in community settings.

TI  == significance of antibiotics resistance amongst clinical bacterial isolates in lagos.
AB  == in vitro susceptibility of several strains of six different species of clinical facultative pathogens involved in nosocomial infections in our hospital was investigated by a series of disc diffusion, broth dilution and chequerboard titration testing. with disc diffusion method all the test strains, except streptococcus pyogenes, were resistant to penicillin. 46% of the klebsiella aerogenes and 73% of the pseudomonas strains were generally resistant to cefotaxime. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the antibiotics correlated well with the results of the disc diffusion tests. synergistic effects were demonstrated by various combinations of gentamicin, ampicillin, clindamycin, colistin, cefoxitin, and ceftriazone against resistant strains of s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and klebsiella aerogenes. against s. aureus the effect of gentamicin/clindamycin demonstrated indifference. the need for stringent caution is strongly advocated in the selection of combination therapy for serious infections caused by some hospital bacterial strains particularly in acute care units. the clinical microbiologist should be consulted at all times during the process of selection of an appropriate combined therapy for expert guidance.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from  the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin c. cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. the majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. these include haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and the  other streptococci (excluding group d streptococci), and moraxella catarrhalis. bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and salmonella and shigella and straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). the pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. the absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. the protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. an oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available  as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). cefuroxime axetil  is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic  bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). for most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate.  in some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. if pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. adverse reactions to  cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during march through april 1985, 1988 and 1992)  to penicillin v, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by mic determination on pdm and pdm ii agar. the mics of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis and staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined  against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and bay y 3118. beta-lactamase production was found in  10% of h. influenzae and 80-90% of s. aureus and b. catarrhalis in 1992. among h. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. decreased susceptibility of s. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. decreased susceptibility of s. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. the two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and bay  y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. the study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefdinir (fk482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent  clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90 0.015-2 mg/l). cefixime was the most active agent against hemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris (mic90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). the activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against s. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (mic90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to  cefixime against s. pyogenes (mic90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against h. influenzae, m. catarrhalis, klebsiella spp. and proteus spp. (mic90 <  0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). the activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against enterococcus faecalis (mic90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). none of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 >  64 mg/l). overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. at 24 h at 1 x mic, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x mic, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

TI  == spontaneous uterine infections are associated with elevated prostaglandin f(2)alpha metabolite concentrations in postpartum dairy cows.
AB  == postpartum holstein (n=21) and jersey (n=4) cows were used to determine if uterine infections are associated with elevated plasma concentrations of 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-prostaglandin f(2)alpha (pgfm). based upon clinical examinations and bacterial content of intrauterine fluid samples, cows detected with uterine infections between 21 and 28 d post partum were used (infected; n=14). these cows were matched with herdmates that were free of infection (control; n=11). beginning on the day the cows were assigned to the experiment (day 1), blood samples were collected on alternate days for the next 14 to 15 d.  plasma samples were stored at -20 degrees c until assayed. from day 1 until the end of the experiment, uterine fluid samples were collected transcervically twice weekly for aerobic bacterial culture. endometrial biopsies were collected between days 6 and 8 and days 13 and 15. control cows did not show signs of uterine infection throughout the trial, and bacterial cultures indicated that there were  no significant bacterial populations in the uteri of the control cows. the uteri  of infected cows harbored numerous microbes. actinomyces pyogenes was most prominent. various species of streptococcus and pasteurella were also prevalent in the infected cows. escherichia coli was present in the uterus of both infected and control cows. biopsies showed that infected cows had more (p<0.05) neutrophils, plasma cells and lymphocytes in the endometrium than did the control cows. as determined by plasma progesterone concentrations, 83% of the control and 50% of the infected cows had functional luteal tissue during the 2-wk sampling period. plasma pgfm profiles were linear (p<0.03) and did not differ between treatment groups (p>0.01). however, average plasma pgfm concentrations were greater (p<0.0001) in infected than in control cows. these data indicate that plasma pgfm concentrations are greater in postpartum cows with spontaneous uterine infections then in herdmates free of infection.

TI  == comparison of antibody activity against various microorganisms in intravenous immunoglobulin preparations determined by elisa and opsonic assay.
AB  == in the present study the level of antimicrobial antibodies and the phagocytosis-promoting activity in immunoglobulin preparations produced for intravenous use were assessed. the level of antibodies directed against various microorganisms in six immunoglobulin preparations was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and was shown to be either equal to or  higher than that of pooled normal human serum. all preparations were able to promote phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli k12, and streptococcus pyogenes by human granulocytes. substantial differences among the various preparations in antibody activity were noted. in particular, intraglobulin, chemically modified by beta-propiolactone treatment, exhibited little activity in both the elisa and the phagocytosis assay. in contrast, ivig src, gamimmune, sandoglobulin (treated at low ph in presence or absence of trace  amounts of pepsin), and gammagard (treated by ion-exchange chromatography) showed good activity in both assays. comparison of the results of the elisa and phagocytosis assay for the various preparations indicated a good correlation except for s. aureus with a moderate (strain 42d) or high (strain cowan i) protein a content. these data indicate that the antibody activity of immunoglobulin preparations against various microorganisms determined by elisa can be used to predict their opsonic activity.

TI  == the identification of rofa, a positive-acting regulatory component of prtf expression: use of an m gamma delta-based shuttle mutagenesis strategy in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == binding of the gram-positive pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus) to respiratory epithelium is mediated by the fibronectin-binding adhesin, protein f. most strains of streptococci regulate the expression of protein f in response to oxygen levels and redox potential; however, jrs4 constitutively binds high levels of fibronectin under all environmental conditions. in this study, we have examined the regulation of protein f expression in jrs4 using a shuttle mutagenesis strategy novel to s. pyogenes. cloned dna representing the chromosomal loci adjacent to the gene which encodes protein f (prtf) was subjected to transposon mutagenesis in escherichia coli using a derivative of transposon m gamma delta that was modified to contain a streptococcal antibiotic-resistance gene. mutagenized dna was then returned to the streptococcal chromosome by allelic replacement. analysis of the resulting fibronectin-binding phenotypes revealed that insertions in a region upstream of prtf abolished the constitutive phenotype. however, these mutants now demonstrated regulation in response to both oxygen levels and redox potential. because these insertions define a locus responsible for the constitutive phenotype, it has been designated rofa (regulator of f). chromosomal interruption studies using integrational plasmids together with complementation data from a previous study (vanheyningen et al., 1993) suggested that rofa acts as a positive trans-acting regulator of prtf. construction of prtf-lacz fusions indicated that  transcription of prtf is constitutive in jrs4 but is regulated in rofa mutants. analysis of the dna sequence defined by the rofa insertions revealed a 1495 bp open reading frame, whose predicted product (rofa) possessed both a putative helix-turn-helix motif and limited homology to two other transcriptional activators (mry, prgr) of gram-positive surface proteins. sequences homologous to rofa were found in regulated strains of s. pyogenes, which suggests that rofa may act as an activator of prtf in response to an unidentified environmental signal.  we speculate that the allele reported here contains a mutation that renders it constitutively active.

AB  == most m type 5 group a streptococcal strains were found to contain a single emm-like gene between virr and scpa (the vir regulon), but two distinct emm-like  genes were identified in the vir regulon of the m5 strain nctc8193. the complete  sequences of both of these genes were determined. one, called emm5.8193, was shown to be a minor variant of the previously described emm5 gene from strain manfredo. the second, designated enn5.8193, expresses an igg-binding protein when cloned in escherichia coli. a comparison of enn5.8193 with emm-like gene sequences from other strains indicated that it has a mosaic structure, consisting of distinct segments originating from emm-like genes in different of+ and of- strains. these data provide the first clear evidence that the horizontal transfer of emm-like sequences between distinct strains contributes to the evolution of group a streptococcal emm-like genes and vir regulons.

TI  == rabbit cap18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  == cap18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kda) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of re-lipopolysaccharide  coated erythrocytes. the c-terminal 37 amino acids of cap18 comprise the lps-binding domain called rnip, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. synthetic rnip has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [ic50 = 130-200 nm] and gram negative bacteria [ic50 = 20-100 nm). susceptible strains include staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes. antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. although a 32  amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the c terminus of rnip is highly active, other fragments of rnip including truncation of its n-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins rnip is active in serum. rnip or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.

TI  == pam, a novel plasminogen-binding protein from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the ability of group a streptococci to bind human plasminogen and plasmin has attracted interest, because it could provide the bacteria with a mechanism for invasion. m or m-like proteins account for the binding of several plasma proteins to group a streptococci. to investigate whether m or m-like proteins were responsible for the binding of plasminogen to group a streptococci, acid-extracted material from a type m53 streptococcal isolate was tested for its  ability to bind plasminogen. indeed, a 42-kda plasminogen-binding protein was solubilized. two oligonucleotides homologous with conserved sequences in known m  protein genes were used as primers in the polymerase chain reaction, with chromosomal dna from the m53 isolate. when cloned and expressed in escherichia coli, a resulting fragment encoded a 43-kda plasminogen-binding protein. nucleotide sequence determination of the gene fragment revealed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 43,580 da, which matched the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the plasminogen-binding protein extracted from m53 streptococci. the dna sequence data also proved the relationship of the encoded protein, named  pam, to the m proteins. the plasminogen-binding domain was mapped to the amino-terminal third of pam. plasminogen absorbed by m53 streptococci or by immobilized pam could be activated by streptokinase. the results provide further  evidence of the diversity of the m protein family and suggest a new mechanism whereby these proteins contribute to the virulence of group a streptococci.

TI  == analysis of streptococcus pyogenes promoters by using novel tn916-based shuttle vectors for the construction of transcriptional fusions to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.
AB  == we have developed a series of shuttle vectors based on the conjugative transposon tn916 that have been designed for the analysis of transcriptional regulation in streptococcus pyogenes and other gram-positive bacteria. designated the pvit vectors (vectors for integration into tn916), the vectors are small, stable plasmids in escherichia coli to facilitate the fusion of promoters from cloned s. pyogenes genes to a promoterless gene which encodes chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. the vectors each contain one or more small regions of tn916 to direct the integration of the transcriptional fusion into the transposon via homologous recombination following transformation of s. pyogenes or other suitable gram-positive hosts. integration can be monitored by the inactivation or replacement of an antibiotic resistance determinant in modified derivatives of tn916. promoter activity can then be quantitated by the determination of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-specific activity. in addition, since integration is into loci that do not disrupt the conjugative transpositional functions of tn916, the vectors are useful for analysis of regulation in strains  that are difficult or impossible to transform and can be introduced into these strains by conjugation following transformation of an intermediate host. the promoters for the genes which encode both the m protein and protein f of s. pyogenes were active in pvit vectors, as was the region which controls transcription of mry, a trans-acting positive regulator of m protein expression.  however, neither of the two characterized promoters for mry demonstrated activity when independently analyzed in pvit-generated partial diploid strains, suggesting that regulation of mry is more complex than predicted by current models. the broad host range of tn916 should make the pvit vectors useful for analysis of regulation in numerous other bacterial species.

TI  == protein f: an adhesin of streptococcus pyogenes binds fibronectin via two distinct domains.
AB  == the binding of streptococcus pyogenes to fibronectin (fn) enables the adherence of this pathogen to target epithelial cells, which is the first necessary step for initiation of infection. binding is mediated by a bacterial surface protein termed protein f. here we provide the complete structure of protein f and identify two domains responsible for binding to fibronectin. the first domain is  located towards the c-terminal end of the molecule and is composed of five repeats of 37 amino acids that are completely repeated four times and a fifth time partially. the second domain is adjacent to the first domain and is located  on the n-terminal side of it. it is composed of a single stretch of 43 amino acids. protein f expressed in escherichia coli completely blocked the binding of  fibronectin to s. pyogenes. however, mutant proteins that contained only one or the other of the two domains were only capable of partial blockage of binding. complete blockage of binding of fibronectin could be achieved when a protein extract containing the n-terminal domain was mixed in a binding reaction with a protein extract containing the c-terminal domain. similarly, a purified recombinant protein containing the two domains only, blocked the binding completely. in contrast, a purified recombinant protein containing just the c-terminal domain, blocked the binding partially. a clone exclusively expressing  the c-terminal domain, completely blocked the binding of the 30 kda n-terminal fragment of fibronectin to s. pyogenes, whereas a clone expressing the n-terminal domain failed to block the binding of this fn fragment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [laboratory and clinical studies on s-1108 in the pediatric field].
AB  == laboratory and clinical studies on s-1108, a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out to evaluate its usefulness at a dose between 2 and 4 mg/kg a day for  7 to 14 days in the pediatric field. 1) pharmacokinetic studies s-1108 at a dose  of 2 mg/kg was administered to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters in 1 subject. cmax, t1/2 and auc were 0.69 hour, 1.42 hours and 2.15 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. 2) antimicrobial activities mics against various clinically isolated organisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus  pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae) were determined. the mic values of s-1006 were similar to those of cefteram, the  mics against s. pyogenes, and h. influenzae were < or = 0.025 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. 3) clinical studies s-1108 was administered to patients with various pediatrics infections in 34 cases (upper respiratory tract  infections: 12 cases, lower respiratory tract infections: 5 cases, urinary tract  infections: 9 cases, skin and soft tissue infection: 6 cases, otitis media: 2 cases). clinical efficacy rate was evaluated according to "standard of clinical evaluation in pediatrics field". the responses were all good or excellent. 4) side reactions there were no serious adverse reactions in any cases. the above results suggest that s-1108 is potent effective and safe agent in the pediatric field at a dose between 2-4 mg/kg (t.i.d.) a day.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of s-1108 in children].
AB  == a new oral cephem antibiotic, s-1108, was evaluated for its clinical efficacy and safety in children. s-1108 was effective in 95% of the 59 examined cases of respiratory, middle ear, skin and urinary tract infections. s-1108 was highly effective in infections of streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, but was less effective in penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus infections. the serum half-life was 1.26 +/- 0.36 hours upon after meal administration of 4 mg/kg. no severe adverse reaction  was encountered. from these data, s-1108 appears to be safe and effective in children with susceptible bacterial infections.

TI  == cefepime: overview of activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == cefepime is a novel methoxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a quaternized  n-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety at the 3' position conferring zwitterionic properties. because of this the molecule penetrates the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria rapidly. in addition it is resistant to degradation by several plasmid and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases, for which it also shows very low affinity and no inducing capacity. it has good affinity for pbps 2 and 3 of escherichia coli and for pbp 3 of pseudomonas aeruginosa. its broad-spectrum of activity includes gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. it is more active than cefotaxime or ceftazidime, against enterobacteriaceae. the mic90 for p. aeruginosa is higher than that of ceftazidime, but lower than those  of cefpirome, cefoperazone and latamoxef. other gram-negative organisms, haemophilus influenzae, neiserria meningitidis, neiserria gonorrhoeae, moraxella  catarrhalis are highly susceptible to cefepime. among gram-positive species methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, whether beta-lactamase producers or not, streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus pyogenes are susceptible. cefepime is active against cefotaxime- and/or ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteriaceae. only strains of p. aeruginosa producing large amounts of beta-lactamase may be resistant to both ceftazidime and cefepime. in experimental infections such as meningitis, induced  with various bacterial species in neonatal rats and chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis in rabbits, cefepime has shown good efficacy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of dv-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == we compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of dv-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. moreover, mic50s for dv-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. dv-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and peptostreptococcus spp. at  0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the mic90 level than the other quinolones tested. the activity of dv-7751a against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the mic90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. dv-7751a showed activity comparable to  those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis (mic90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). dv-7751a activity  was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of dv-7751a against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa. the frequency of spontaneous resistance to dv-7751a was less than or  equal to those of the reference drugs. dv-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of dna gyrases from s. aureus, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == in order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic's) of cdzm and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide  medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. the followings are a summary of the results: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter diversus, most of klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. some strains of klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant escherichia coli seemed likely. among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including cdzm and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. mic90's of cdzm against streptococcus spp., h. infleunzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp. and p. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. this indicates that cdzm would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. however, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant s. pneumoniae, cephem resistant e. coli and cephem resistant k. oxytoca with cdzm. 3. among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of cdzm with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. antibacterial activities of cdzm we observed in this study seem to indicate that  cdzm concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above mic levels for relatively long periods of time.

TI  == cloning, characterization and overexpression of a streptococcus pyogenes gene encoding a new type of mitogenic factor.
AB  == a new type of mitogenic factor, termed mf, has been found in the culture supernatant of streptococcus pyogenes and its n-terminal amino acid sequence has  been determined. on the basis of this sequence, an s. pyogenes gene encoding mf was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. the mf gene includes a long, open reading frame with 813 nucleotides capable of encoding the mf precursor protein with 271 amino acids. removal of the putative 43 residues as a  signal peptide results in the mature mf protein with 228 amino acids. the molecular mass of the mature mf is calculated as 25,363 which is consistent with  the previously determined value of 25,370 for mf secreted from s. pyogenes. neither nucleotide nor amino acid sequence homology was found between the mature  mf and other streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, such as spe a, spe b and spe c. the mature mf was recombinantly overexpressed as a fusion protein with glutathione s-transferase in escherichia coli. the recombinant protein showed mitogenic activity in rabbit peripheral blood lymphocytes and immunoreactivity with the rabbit antiserum raised against the secreted mf from s. pyogenes. these  data indicate that a unique gene encoding mf was cloned from s. pyogenes.

TI  == molecular cloning, identification, and sequence of the hyaluronan synthase gene from group a streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the hyaluronan (ha) synthase of group a streptococci has been identified by transposon mutagenesis and deletion analysis. the genes for the ha synthase and a recently identified udp-glc dehydrogenase (dougherty, b. a., and van de rijn, i.  (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 7118-7124) reside on a contiguous stretch of 3.2-kilobase pair dna that can direct ha biosynthesis in enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli as well as mutant streptococcus (deangelis, p. l., papaconstantinou, j., and weigel, p. h. (1993) j. biol. chem. 268, 14568-14571).  the synthase contains 395 residues (calculated mr = 45,063) and migrates on sds-page with a molecular mass of 42 kda. e. coli k5, which synthesizes udp-glucuronic acid for production of its endogenous capsular polysaccharide, can make ha if it contains a plasmid encoding the intact 42-kda protein. e. coli sure or chi 1448 cells containing the same construct, however, cannot produce ha since these strains cannot make both required sugar nucleotide precursors. the ha synthase is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with four membrane-associated helices, which is consistent with the location of the enzyme  activity in streptococci. there is significant homology between the ha synthase and the rhizobium nodc gene product, an enzyme that synthesizes chitin-like oligomers. this is the first description at the molecular level of an enzyme shown to synthesize a glycosaminoglycan.

TI  == isolation of three antibacterial peptides from pig intestine: gastric inhibitory  polypeptide (7-42), diazepam-binding inhibitor (32-86) and a novel factor, peptide 3910.
AB  == two antibacterial peptides, cecropin p1 and pr-39 (39-residue proline/arginine-rich peptide), from the upper part of pig small intestine have previously been isolated and characterized. we have now continued our search for  antibacterial peptides in different side fractions generated during the isolation of intestinal hormones. starting from one such fraction and monitoring activity against bacillus megaterium, we isolated three homogeneous peptides by three consecutive chromatographic steps. amino acid sequence analysis in combination with mass spectrometry identified two of the peptides as gastric inhibitory polypeptide (7-42) [gip(7-42)] and diazepam-binding inhibitor (32-86) [dbi(32-86)], derived from factors already known. however, intact gip and dbi have hardly any antibacterial activity by themselves. the third peptide constitutes a previously unknown structure, designated as peptide 3910 from its molecular mass. all three peptides showed good activity against b. megaterium. in addition, gip (7-42) showed some activity against streptococcus pyogenes and an escherichia coli mutant with a defect in its outer membrane.

AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for sultamicillin (sbtpc), and for other major oral beta-lactam agents against clinically isolated  strains collected from outpatients during a period from august, 1992 to february, 1993, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of penicillinase  (pcase)-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus was 96.0% and that of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) was 12.0%. mic90 of sbtpc against s. aureus including mrsa was 6.25 micrograms/ml. no increasing tendency was observed for s. aureus resistant to sbtpc. 2. no resistant strains were found among streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis against penicillins (pcs) including sbtpc. but pcs and cephems (ceps) insensitive or resistant streptococcus pneumoniae were observed in 22.0% among all the strains of s. pneumoniae. 3. 100% of the tested both strains of escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis were beta-lactamase producers. 12.0% of the tested strains of haemophilus influenzae and 16.0% of the strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae were also beta-lactamase producers. sbtpc showed strong antimicrobial activity against most of these beta-lactamase producing strains. however, in our study of beta-lactamase productivity using plural substrates and test methods, it appeared that a part of strains of e. coli might produce beta-lactamase of "extended broad-spectrum". mics of sbtpc and ceps against those strains were distributed rather in a high range. 4. the results of the study suggested that the resistant  strains of s. pneumoniae against pcs and ceps might be increasing year by year. some of strains of e. coli, resistance against the 2 agents were observed. it is  important to keep observing changes in resistance of such organisms in the future. 5. the antimicrobial activities of sbtpc against clinically isolated strains in this study indicated potential problems such as those mentioned above. it is, however, also confirmed that sbtpc shows still strong antimicrobial activities against most of beta-lactamase producing strains found in daily medical examinations. taking into consideration of the strong activities of sbtpc against so-called indirect pathogenicity caused by beta-lactamase producing indigenous bacteria reported lately, sbtpc may be a useful antibiotic for community acquired infections in the 1990's.

TI  == review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == recombinant tetravalent group a streptococcal m protein vaccine.
AB  == previous studies have shown that the amino-terminal regions of group a streptococcal m proteins contain primarily protective (opsonic) epitopes and not  tissue-cross-reactive epitopes. limited primary structures from multiple serotypes of m protein containing only protective epitopes could potentially be linked together to form a broadly protective vaccine. the present studies were undertaken to determine the protective immunogenicity of a recombinant, multivalent hybrid molecule containing amino-terminal subunits of types 24, 5, 6, and 19 m proteins. polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify emm gene fragments ranging from 35 to 113 codons. the pcr products were ligated in tandem and inserted into pkk223-3. the tetravalent m protein that was purified from extracts of escherichia coli migrated as a single band on sds-page with an apparent m.w. of 31 kda. in immunoblot analyses, the hybrid protein reacted with  serotype-specific antisera indicating that it contained all four m protein subunits. rabbits immunized with the purified tetravalent m protein developed significant antibody levels against all four serotypes of native m proteins represented in the hybrid protein. none of the antisera cross-reacted with human  tissues. the immune sera also opsonized all four serotypes of group a streptococci. our data show that a hybrid protein containing subunits from multiple m proteins can evoke broadly protective immune responses without tissue-cross-reactive antibodies.

AB  == a contiguous 3-kilobase pair region of dna was isolated from group a streptococcus pyogenes (gas) that can direct hyaluronic acid (ha) capsule biosynthesis in acapsular mutants as well as heterologous bacteria. the dna was identified by transposon 916 insertional mutagenesis and subcloned into a plasmid shuttle vector. mutant acapsular gas or enterococcus faecalis containing this plasmid, but not vector alone, displayed a mucoid phenotype on agar plates, possessed a capsule as seen by light microscopy, and produced ha in quantities comparable with wild-type gas. the polysaccharide was shown to be authentic ha based on its recognition by a specific proteoglycan and its degradation by streptomyces hyaluronate lyase. escherichia coli with the complementing plasmid also produced ha but at only 10% of the level made by the above cells. e. coli minicell analysis showed that two proteins, 42 and 45 kda, are expressed by the functional dna insert. deletion analysis of the insert in the minicells revealed  that the 42-kda protein is essential for ha production. this is the first demonstration of reconstitution of ha capsule biosynthesis in vivo.

TI  == post-antibiotic effects of ofloxacin on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of ofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either once of four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. similar to the results obtained previously with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin gave pae values with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. cell division of klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited on removal of ofloxacin, but no clear pae was demonstrated with this species because once replication recommenced, the mean generation times of drug-treated cultures were much shorter than those of untreated controls. therefore, although the results obtained with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin imply a consistency of pae for 4-quinolones within a  species, the response to dna damage induced by 4-quinolones is multifaceted and species dependent. 4-quinolones inhibit both dna replication and cell division, whilst at the same time stimulating dna repair pathways. thus, in some cases paes result from an increased post-treatment lag phase which may be followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag may be followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being shorter than those of corresponding drug-free controls. the pae of a drug-induced lag may thus be masked by rapid cell division once growth resumes.

AB  == loracarbef is an orally administered member of a new synthetic class of beta-lactam antibiotics, the carbacephems, which is characterised by enhanced chemical stability. at low concentrations (< 2 mg/l) in vitro, it inhibits streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, beta-haemolytic streptococci groups b, c and g. proteus mirabilis and moraxella catarrhalis, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. at therapeutic plasma concentrations it is also active in vitro against most strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus,  escherichia coli and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of haemophilus influenzae. like other beta-lactams, loracarbef is inactive against methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. when administered at dosages of 200 to 400 mg twice daily, the clinical and bacteriological efficacy of loracarbef is comparable with that of amoxicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and comparable with that of cefaclor in treating infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures and urinary tract. loracarbef and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin  v) were equally effective in treating streptococcal pharyngitis and tonsillitis.  loracarbef is generally well tolerated by all age groups and causes less diarrhoea than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. it is administered twice daily. it offers a suitable alternative to other orally administered antibiotics for the treatment of mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible organisms.

TI  == hybrids of antibiotics inhibiting protein synthesis. synthesis and biological activity.
AB  == four hybrid antibiotics combining structural features of chloramphenicol (1a), sparsomycin (2b), lincomycin (5c), and puromycin (6d)--lincophenicol (1c), chloramlincomycin (5a), sparsolincomycin (5b), and sparsopuromycin (6b)--were synthesized. they were investigated as inhibitors of several partial reactions of procaryotic and eucaryotic protein synthesis as well as potential antimicrobial agents. lincophenicol (1c) was active as inhibitor of escherichia coli ribosomal  peptidyltransferase-catalyzed puromycin reaction. both lincophenicol (1c) and sparsophenicol (1b) inhibited the binding of the iodophenol analogue of sparsomycin to e. coli ribosomes. the results are discussed in terms of a retro-inverso hypothesis advanced earlier for interpretation of biological activity of chloramphenicol (1a) and sparsophenicol (1b). chloramlincomycin (5a)  suppressed the growth of streptococcus pyogenes with mic 6.25 micrograms/ml.

TI  == quinolone antibacterials containing the new 7-[3-(1-aminoethyl)-1- pyrrolidinyl]  side chain: the effects of the 1-aminoethyl moiety and its stereochemical configurations on potency and in vivo efficacy.
AB  == a series of stereochemically pure 7-[3-(1-aminoethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl]-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline and 1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acids, with varied substituents at the 1-, 5-, and 8-positions, were synthesized to study the effects of the 7-[3-(1-aminoethyl)-1- pyrrolidinyl] moiety on potency and in vivo efficacy relative to the known 7-[3-(aminomethyl)-1- pyrrolidinyl] derivatives. the antibacterial efficacies of the target compounds and their relevant reference agents were determined in vitro using an assortment of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms and in vivo using escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes mouse infection models. the effects of the 7-[3-(1-aminoethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] moiety were also examined at the level of the target enzyme by employing a dna-gyrase supercoiling inhibition assay. selected compounds were further evaluated for potential phototoxic and clastogenic liabilities using a phototoxicity mouse model and an in vitro mammalian cell cytotoxicity assay. it was found that the differences in in vitro antibacterial activity between the stereoisomers were significantly greater than previously reported for other optically pure 3-substituted pyrrolidinyl side chains. relative to their 7-[3-(aminomethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] analogs, the (3r,1s)-3-(1-aminoethyl)pyrrolidines generally conferred a 2-4-fold increase in gram-positive in vitro activity and an average of 10-fold improvement in oral efficacy. the level of phototoxicity and cytotoxicity of the product quinolones was ultimately determined by the combined influence of the 7-[3-(1-aminoethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] side chains and the other quinolone substituents. from this study, several compounds were identified with outstanding antibacterial activity and low degrees of phototoxicity and mammalian cell cytotoxicity. one such agent, 34f-r,s (pd 140248), showed the best overall blend  of safety and efficacy.

TI  == antibacterial activity of nm394, the active form of prodrug nm441, a new quinolone.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of nm394 was compared with those of other new quinolones. nm394 showed potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against 2,606 recent clinical isolates. the activity of nm394 against gram-positive bacteria was 2- to 16-fold less than that of tosulfoxacin and sparfloxacin but was comparable to that of ofloxacin. only against streptococcus pyogenes was the  activity of nm394 equal to that of sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria,  nm394 showed antibacterial activity equal to that of ciprofloxacin. against quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (norfloxacin mic, > 6.25 micrograms/ml), the activity of nm394 was greater than those of the other agents  tested. nm394 was rapidly bactericidal at concentrations near the mic. nm394 inhibited supercoiling activities of dna gyrase purified from staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and p. aeruginosa; the 50% inhibitory concentrations were 18.0, 0.41, and 2.05 micrograms/ml, respectively.

TI  == identification of a fibronectin-binding protein as adhesin of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the role of streptococcal fibronectin-binding protein (sfb protein) in the adherence of streptococcus pyogenes to epithelial cells was analyzed by using a recombinant sfb fusion protein which was constructed by fusion of the binding domain of sfb protein to ms2 polymerase. sfb fusion protein was overexpressed in  escherichia coli, purified from e. coli lysates by fplc and analysed in binding experiments with 125i-labelled fibronectin and adherence studies with hep2 epithelial cells. lysates from e. coli expressing the fusion protein as well as purified sfb protein competitively inhibited fibronectin binding and epithelial cell adherence of s. pyogenes, whereas streptococcal lipoteichoic acid (lta), previously suggested to be the adhesin of s. pyogenes, had no effects. southern blot analysis of chromosomal dna from various streptococci revealed that the gene coding for the binding domain of sfb protein was also present in other s. pyogenes strains. these results indicate that fibronectin-binding protein is the  major adhesin of s. pyogenes.

TI  == stimulation of human t cells by streptococcal "superantigen" erythrogenic toxins  (scarlet fever toxins).
AB  == the pyrogenic (erythrogenic) exotoxins a and c (spea and spec) of streptococcus pyogenes belong to the family of mitogenic toxins of which the staphylococcal enterotoxins are the prototypes. the erythrogenic toxin b (speb) is a proteinase  precursor. all spe have been reported to be superantigens. here we have analyzed  the human t cell response to these toxins. we used highly purified preparations of spea, speb, and spec from different s. pyogenes strains. these toxins were apparently homogenous in sds-page, ief, and hplc. in addition, recombinant spea and spec were produced in escherichia coli. in cultures of pbmc, all three toxins expanded preferentially a fraction of t cells. using mab against v beta 2, -5, -6, -8, and -12, we investigated the phenotype of the stimulated cells. natural spea, speb, and spec strongly stimulated v beta 8+ t cells, whereas recombinant spea and spec did not. both natural and recombinant spea stimulated v beta 12+ cells and both natural and recombinant spec stimulated v beta 2+ cells. in accordance with these findings, a human v beta 8+ line responded to all three toxins derived from s. pyogenes but not to the recombinant proteins. an antiserum against natural spec neutralized specifically the v beta 2-stimulating activity of spec and the v beta 8-stimulating activity of all three toxins, but had no effect on the response to other superantigens. this shows that trace amounts of a potent novel v beta 8-stimulating activity not identical to spea and spec are responsible for the stimulation of v beta 8+ t cells by natural spea and spec reported previously. in a preliminary screening of s. pyogenes strains from patients, we found that this novel superantigen appears to be more widely distributed than spea and spec. furthermore, we present evidence that also the superantigenic properties of speb are due to contaminations with this v beta 8 stimulator. the response to speb usually required 1000 times higher concentrations than to spea or spec. antisera to spec but not to speb inhibited the response of pbmc and v beta 8+ jurkat cells to speb. furthermore, more stringent purification of speb yielded speb preparations devoid of mitogenic activity. these results indicate that the mitogenicity that is commonly attributed to speb is due to minute contaminations of the v beta 8 stimulator. these results raise two important caveats for the work with these highly potent t cell mitogens.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == type m12 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is a receptor for igg3.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes, serotype m12, was discovered to express a human igg3 binding protein. western blot analysis of partially purified m12 protein, exposed to igg3 myeloma protein, showed that both m12 ag and the receptor protein were the same apparent size. a lambda clone (lambda 4.1) containing the emm12 open reading frame expressed both the m12 ag and the igg3 binding protein. the emm12 open reading frame was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the expression vector pjla602. based on western blot analysis, one recombinant escherichia coli (pd3) expressed m12 protein with igg3 binding activity. this result confirmed that the m12 protein from strain cs24 is also an  igg3 receptor. deletion analyses showed that a truncated m12 protein encoded by an internal pvuii fragment was sufficient for igg3 binding activity. further deletion studies suggested that the igg3 binding domain was located in a 200 amino acid internal fragment containing two directly repeated sequences. other experiments suggest that the receptor did not bind to the same igg3 domain as that recognized by protein g. the m12 protein did not bind human igg1, igg2, igg4, or ig from several other animal species.

TI  == bacterial infection complicating varicella infection: a 10-year review of hospitalized children.
AB  == an increased incidence of streptococci pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gas]) infections and rheumatic fever has been reported over the past decade. the present study was conducted to determine whether a similar increase in such infections was observed after varicella, an infection previously shown to be associated with a high incidence of streptococcal infections. the charts of all children admitted with chickenpox to the hospital for sick children in toronto, ontario from january 1, 1980 to december 31, 1989 were reviewed. immunocompromised children and those hospitalized for another reason who had an incidental diagnosis of chickenpox were excluded. twenty-five cases with bacterial infection complicating chickenpox were compared with 103 patients without secondary infection. no statistically significant differences were observed for age, gender, duration of illness prior to hospitalization or duration of hospitalization in the two groups. gas was the most frequent isolate  in the cases, followed by staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae. the types of infection were significantly different for gas compared  with other organisms, with a predominance of skin infections in the former group  (chi(2) analysis, p<0.05). no increase in the incidence of gas infections was observed over time. this study confirms the importance of gas infections in patients with varicella, but no increase was observed in hospitalized children during the 10-year study period.

TI  == probable role of streptococcus pyogenes in kawasaki disease.
AB  == over the past 25 years, the clinical course of kawasaki disease has been defined, the prevalence and nature of the cardiovascular effects widely understood, and pathological changes in the most severe cases well described. however, the aetiology and pathogenesis of this puzzling disease have remained unclear, thus specific therapy is not yet available. because of some close clinical similarities between this disease and streptococcal scarlet fever, particular attention has been paid to the possible role of streptococcus pyogenes as an aetiological agent in this illness. until now, however, group a beta-haemolytic streptococci have never been consistently isolated from any patients; in addition, the titre of anti-streptolysin 0 is not raised, and lack of response to antibiotics is a feature of this disease. our long series of investigations over  more than 10 years, which will be covered in the present review, were performed in an attempt at elucidating causative agent(s) of kawasaki disease. this has led to our firm belief in the probable role of s. pyogenes in the pathogenesis of this disease, despite the lack of fulfillment of koch's postulates, on the basis  of the following findings. patients with kawasaki disease recovering from the acute, febrile phase of the illness exhibited an exaggerated cell-mediated reactivity, as measured by the macrophage migration inhibition test, to group a beta-haemolytic streptococci, their pyrogenic exotoxin and streptolysin 0 as well as to several mammalian muscle cell extracts which are allegedly related antigenically to the cell wall and/or cytoplasmic membrane of s. pyogenes. protoplast-like "spherical bodies" varying in diameter from 0.5 to 1.5 microns, and devoid of cell walls, were detected in the buffy coats of peripheral blood from patients with this disease, and stained distinctly by immuno-electron microscopy using, as a primary antibody, a rabbit antiserum to s. pyogenes- derived protoplasts, and followed by absorption with protoplasts from staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. newborn mice infected with s. pyogenes having no capacity to confer cell-mediated immunity even in adult murine hosts, and reinfected 4-6 weeks later with another strain of the same species of  bacteria which is able to elicit cellular immunity, showed a lack of humoral response to streptococcal antigens, leaving intact cell-mediated immunity. such a biased immunological characteristic is an exact counterpart of that of kawasaki disease patients.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == immunodiagnosis of group-a streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  == seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-a streptococci were generated. all of them were of igm isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-a streptococci and polysaccharide. these were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-b, -c, -g and staphylococcus aureus. polyclonal antibodies against group-a polysaccharide (aps) were also raised in rabbits by linking aps to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. the assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng aps/ml as compared to 1 microgram aps/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-b, -c, -g, staph. aureus, cornybacterium diptheriae, candida albicans, candida spp., morexella catarrhalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, strep. pneumoniae. salmonella typhi and s. paratyphi a and b. throat  swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-a, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.

TI  == contributions of post-antibiotic lag and repair-recovery to the post-antibiotic effects of ciprofloxacin on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == a viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (pae) of ciprofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either one or four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. pae were demonstrated with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes after exposure to either concentration for both times. no clear pae was  demonstrated for klebsiella pneumoniae after any treatment. in some cases, pae was due to an increased post-treatment lag phase, which was followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag was followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being much less than those of the corresponding drug-free controls. this is evidence of recovery of cells that have completed dna repair. s. aureus, e. coli  and k. pneumoniae all exhibited evidence of this type of repair even though k. pneumoniae gave no significant pae. however, the post-treatment generation times  of s. pyogenes, which produced the greatest pae, gave no evidence of such repair. it is concluded that paes may result from a variety of factors.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of a series of basic amides of teicoplanin and deglucoteicoplanin with polyamines.
AB  == basic carboxamides of teicoplanin a2 (cta) and its aglycon (td) are prepared by condensation of the 63-carboxyl function of these antibiotics with linear or branched polyamines. the antimicrobial activities of some of the resulting compounds were better than those of the unmodified antibiotics. the presence of more than one basic group in the amidic chain enhanced the in vitro activity of some td-amides against gram-negative bacteria; two of these derivatives were also effective in vivo against escherichia coli septicemia in the mouse. among the cta derivatives, the amide with spermine showed some unexpected in vitro activity against gram-negatives. both cta- and td-amides with polyamines are very soluble  in water over a wide range of ph and are very hydrophilic.

TI  == mhc-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human cd8+ cytotoxic t lymphocytes.
AB  == a cd8+ alpha beta tcr+ t cell clone (a35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by yersinia enterocolitica. this clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. there was no restriction by polymorphic parts of hla-a, -b, or -c molecules and a hla class ii-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected hla class i-deficient cells (daudi cells) were not. the clone showed crossreaction between yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with staphylococcus epidermidis. mab to cd2, cd3, and cd8 efficiently blocked a35, whereas the addition of mab to hla class ii or to hla class i did not. this clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.

TI  == fibronectin-binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes: sequence of the binding domain involved in adherence of streptococci to epithelial cells.
AB  == the sequence of the fibronectin-binding domain of the fibronectin-binding protein of streptococcus pyogenes (sfb protein) was determined, and its role in streptococcal adherence was investigated by use of an sfb fusion protein in adherence studies. a 1-kb dna fragment coding for the binding domain of sfb protein was cloned into the expression vector pex31 to produce an sfb fusion protein consisting of the n-terminal part of ms2 polymerase and a c-terminal fragment of the streptococcal protein. induction of the vector promoter resulted  in hyperexpression of fibronectin-binding fusion protein in the cytoplasm of the  recombinant escherichia coli cells. sequence determination of the cloned 1-kb fragment revealed an in-frame reading frame for a 268-amino-acid peptide composed of a 37-amino-acid sequence which is completely repeated three times and incompletely repeated a fourth time. cloning of one repeat into pex31 resulted in expression of small fusion peptides that show fibronectin-binding activity, indicating that one repeat contains at least one binding domain. each repeat exhibits two charged domains and shows high homology with the 38-amino-acid d3 repeat of the fibronectin-binding protein of staphylococcus aureus. sequence comparison with other streptococcal ligand-binding surface proteins, including m  protein, failed to reveal significant homology, which suggests that sfb protein represents a novel type of functional protein in s. pyogenes. the sfb fusion protein isolated from the cytoplasm of recombinant cells was purified by fast protein liquid chromatography. it showed a strong competitive inhibition of fibronectin binding to s. pyogenes and of the adherence of bacteria to cultured epithelial cells. in contrast, purified streptococcal lipoteichoic acid showed only a weak inhibition of fibronectin binding and streptococcal adherence. these  results demonstrate that sfb protein is directly involved in the fibronectin-mediated adherence of s. pyogenes to epithelial cells.

AB  == the sub-mic effects (smes) and the postantibiotic sub-mic effects (pa smes) of vancomycin, roxithromycin, and sparfloxacin for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae and of amikacin for escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated. a postantibiotic effect was induced by exposing strains to 10x the mic of the antibiotic for 2 h in vitro. after the induction, the exposed cultures were washed to eliminate the antibiotics. unexposed controls were treated similarly. thereafter, the exposed cultures (pa sme) and the controls (sme) were exposed to different subinhibitory concentrations (0.1, 0.2,  and 0.3x the mic) of the same drug and growth curves for a period of 24 h were compared. in general, the pa smes were much more pronounced than the smes. however, for amikacin and e. coli the sme of 0.2 and 0.3x the mic also had an initial bactericidal effect. the longest pa smes were demonstrated for the combinations with the most pronounced killing during the induction and for the combinations which exhibited the longest paes.

TI  == one step purification and characterization of the pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase  of streptococcus pyogenes over-expressed in escherichia coli.
AB  == pyrrolidone carboxyl peptidase (ec 3.4.11.8) (pcp), an enzyme which selectively removes pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (pca) from some pca-peptides and -proteins, was demonstrated in bacteria and in plant, animal and human tissues. in this paper we describe the purification to homogeneity of the enzyme of streptococcus  pyogenes, over-expressed in escherichia coli. this was achieved, for the first time in one step, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. analysis under non-denaturing conditions revealed a molecular mass of 85 kda and in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate gave a molecular mass of 23.5 kda. investigations on enzymatic properties showed that the pcp over-expressed in e. coli disclosed properties similar to those found for the enzyme extracted from s. pyogenes or for some other pcps studied previously. thus the over-expressed enzyme should serve as a suitable source for n-terminal unblocking prior to some pca protein sequencing.

TI  == molecular characterization of pcp, the structural gene encoding the pyrrolidone carboxylyl peptidase from streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == this paper describes the cloning of a gene (pcp) coding for pyrrolidone carboxylyl peptidase (pyrase), an enzyme which selectively removes n-terminal pyroglutamic acid residues from polypeptides. this gene was isolated from streptococcus pyogenes by construction of a gene library with a bacteriophage lambda-derived cosmid-escherichia coli host system. nucleotide sequence determination of a 1.3 kb restriction fragment revealed a 645 bp open reading frame encoding a 215-amino-acid product of m(r) 23,135 consistent with the 26 kda polypeptide obtained from in vivo overexpression in e. coli. southern hybridization confirmed that pcp is a single-copy gene on the s. pyogenes chromosome. 5' and 3' endpoint mapping of the 0.7 kb specific transcript observed by northern analysis permitted the identification of transcriptional initiation and termination signals. structural features of the pcp gene product from s. pyogenes are discussed and compared with that from bacillus subtilis. the lack of sequence identity with any other known protein or nucleotide sequence suggests that this enzyme belongs to a new class of peptidase.

TI  == cloning, sequence analysis, and expression in escherichia coli of a streptococcal plasmin receptor.
AB  == plasmin(ogen) receptors are expressed by many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. we previously isolated a plasmin receptor from a pathogenic group a streptococcal strain (c. c. broder, r. lottenberg, g. o. von mering, k. h. johnston, and m. d. p. boyle, j. biol. chem. 266:4922-4928, 1991). the gene encoding this plasmin receptor, plr, was isolated from a lambda gt11 library of chromosomal dna from group a streptococcal strain 64/14 by screening plaques with antibodies raised against the purified streptococcal plasmin receptor protein. the gene was subcloned by using a low-copy-number plasmid and stably expressed in escherichia coli, resulting in the production of an immunoreactive and functional receptor protein. the dna sequence of the gene contained an open reading frame encoding 335 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 35,787. upstream of the open reading frame, putative promoter and ribosomal binding site sequences were identified. the experimentally derived amino acid sequences of the n terminus and three cyanogen bromide fragments of the purified streptococcal plasmin receptor protein corresponded to the predicted sequence encoded by plr. the deduced amino acid sequence for the plasmin receptor protein revealed significant similarity (39 to 54% identical amino acid residues) to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

TI  == introduction of the emm6 gene into an emm-deleted strain of streptococcus pyogenes restores its ability to resist phagocytosis.
AB  == to complete the formal proof that the m protein functions to protect the group a  streptococcus from phagocytosis and to lay the groundwork for the molecular genetic dissection of this major virulence factor, we have reintroduced a wild-type allele of the m protein gene (emm) into the chromosome of a strain from which it had previously been deleted. for this purpose, we used homologous recombination with an engineered plasmid that was introduced into the streptococcus pyogenes chromosome by an electroporation technique that we developed. the plasmid pjrs120e was constructed in escherichia coli and contains  the structural gene for the antiphagocytic m6 protein (emm6) of s. pyogenes jrs4  and a selectable marker (ermam) between the chromosomal regions that flank emm6 in s. pyogenes. this plasmid was introduced into s. pyogenes strain jrs75, a strain that is not resistant to phagocytosis as a result of the allelic replacement of the emm6 gene by a kanamycin resistance gene (apha3). dna hybridization analysis indicated that in erythromycin-resistant strain jrs115, homologous recombination resulted in the replacement of the apha3 gene of jrs75 with the introduced emm6 allele. strain jrs115 produces approximately the same amount of m6 as does the parental emm6+ strain jrs4, as assayed by western blot analysis, and is resistant to phagocytosis.

TI  == protein f, a fibronectin-binding protein, is an adhesin of the group a streptococcus streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == binding to fibronectin has been suggested to play an important role in adherence  of the group a streptococcus streptococcus pyrogenes to host epithelial cells; however, the identity of the streptococcal fibronectin receptor has been elusive. here we demonstrate that the fibronectin-binding property of s. pyogenes is mediated by protein f, a bacterial surface protein that binds fibronectin at high affinity. the gene encoding protein f (prtf) produced a functional fibronectin-binding protein in escherichia coli. insertional mutagenesis of the cloned gene generated a mutation that resulted in the loss of fibronectin-binding activity. when this mutation was introduced into the s. pyrogenes chromosome by homologous recombination with the wild-type allele, the resulting strains no longer produced protein f and lost their ability to bind fibronectin. the mutation could be complemented by prtf introduced on a plasmid. mutants lacking protein f had a much lower capacity to adhere to respiratory epithelial cells. these results demonstrate that protein f is an important adhesin of s. pyogenes.

AB  == loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. a review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values (microgram/ml) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; m. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; h. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; escherichia coli, 2.0-25; klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; s. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. the in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. the results of in vitro susceptibility tests with  any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. this is particularly true with h. influenzae. furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.

AB  == bacteriological and clinical studies have been performed on meropenem (mepm, sm-7338), a newly developed carbapenem antibiotic, in the pediatric field. 1. antibacterial activities of mepm against 24 clinical isolates were determined. mepm showed excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria, especially escherichia coli and branhamella catarrhalis. against haemophilus influenzae, mepm had a higher activity than imipenem and flomoxef, but had a lower activity than piperacillin and cefoperazone. 2. clinical efficacies of mepm were evaluated in 32 cases with  bacterial infections. a poor efficacy was observed in 1 patient with phlegmon but excellent or good efficacies were obtained in other 31 patients with tonsillitis  (1), pneumonia (17), uti (12), or ssss (1). the overall efficacy rate was 96.9%.  all strains except 1 of s. aureus were eradicated by the administration of mepm,  and a high eradication rate of 95.8% (23 out of 24 strains) was obtained. 3. no side effects were observed in 35 evaluated cases. as abnormal laboratory test results, elevated got, elevated gpt, eosinophilia and neutropenia were noted in 4, 4, 4 and 2 patients, respectively. 4. influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. pivka ii was elevated upon administration of mepm in some cases, but no changes in att, tt, hpt or fbg were observed during the treatment. based on the above results, it has been concluded that mepm is a safe  and effective drug to use in the treatment of pediatric infections. the usual recommended dosage and administration should be 10 to 20 mg/kg of mepm at a time, using intravenous drip infusion, 3 times a day.

TI  == degenerate oligonucleotide primers for enzymatic amplification of reca sequences  from gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas.
AB  == reca protein in gram-negative bacteria, especially in escherichia coli, has been  extensively studied, but little is known about this key enzyme in other procaryotes. described here are degenerate oligonucleotide primers that have been used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) reca sequences from several gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas. the dna sequences of reca pcr products from streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and mycoplasma pulmonis were determined and compared. these data indicate that the m. pulmonis reca gene has diverged significantly from reca genes of other eubacteria. it should be possible to use cloned reca pcr products  to construct reca mutants, thereby providing the means of elucidating homologous  genetic recombination and dna repair activities in these organisms.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous  antimicrobial barrier.

TI  == bacteriology of wound infection: evaluation by surface swab and quantitative full thickness wound biopsy culture.
AB  == a total of 171 cases of wounds of various aetiology were examined and screened bacteriologically for evidence of infection by surface swab culture and quantitative full thickness wound biopsy culture techniques. staphylococcus pyogenes was the most frequently isolated (39.9%) single organism. other organisms being escherichia coli (26.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.4%), klebsiella species (5.8%), streptococcus pyogenes (4.9%), proteus species (4.8%)  and coliform organism (3.1%). collectively the gram-negative organisms were the majority among the isolated organisms. as indicator of wound infection, surface swab culture was found to be reliable in 72% cases when correlated with wound biopsy culture. the latter technique was found to be more consistently valuable (in 95% cases) both for regular assessment of the wounds as well as to judge the  response to treatment.

TI  == effects of growth factors, hormones, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and lipotechoic acids on the clonal growth of normal ureteral epithelial cells in serum-free culture.
AB  == in vitro tissue culture techniques were employed to study the effects of bacterial endotoxins on the growth of normal epithelial cells from the human ureter (nhu). primary cultures of nhu cells were initiated from explant outgrowth cultures of human ureteral tissue and cultured on collagen gel in f-12* medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (fcs). optimal clonal growth of secondary cultures of nhu cells seeded at relatively low seeding cell densities, directly on plastic dishes, was achieved in f-12* medium containing bovine pituitary extract (0.5% bpe) and 0.05% bsa. results indicated that insulin in the f-12* medium could be replaced by three orders of magnitude less igf-1. further clonal growth experiments demonstrated that pge1 is growth stimulatory and can replace bpe as a growth factor requirement. this finding was in agreement with the fact that bpe growth requirement could be replaced by cholera toxin or dibutyryl camp. these results suggested that both bpe and cholera toxin operated by activation of a camp-dependent mitogenic pathway. seven gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) and three gram-positive bacterial lipotechoic acids (lt) were tested for their effects on nhu clonal growth. three out of the five lps derived from escherichia coli (strains 055:b5, 0128:b12, and 0127:b8), lps from klebsiella pneumoniae, and lps from pseudomonas aeruginosa all showed significant growth inhibitory effects at minimally effective doses ranging from 5 to 25 micrograms/ml. lps derived from e. coli strain (0111:b4) had no growth effects at the highest concentration tested (100 micrograms/ml). in contrast, lt  derived from streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, staphylococcus aureas, and bacillus subtilis all markedly enhanced clonal growth at concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml less than [lt] less than 50 micrograms/ml. lt from strep. pyogenes was inhibitory to clonal growth at 100 micrograms/ml. the growth inhibitory effects of lps were shown to be sensitive to the presence of hydrocortisone in the growth medium, indicating that lps effects on growth are mediated via the arachidonic acid cascade. we speculate that these results indicate a link between the susceptibility of uroepithelial tissue to the pathogenic microflora seen in urinary tract diseases and the differential sensitivity of proliferation-competent uroepithelial cells to growth inhibition by lps produced by gram-negative bacteria. however, further studies with uropathogenic serotypes will be necessary to corroborate this possibility. the growth-stimulating activity of lts produced by gram-positive bacteria may be due  to their ability to bind to cell-associated fibronectin and to activate the fibronectin receptor as part of ligand receptor-induced mitogenic transmembrane signalling pathway.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem were compared with those of imipenem, ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefuzonam and cefotiam. meropenem showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical isolates of gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria. against gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, meropenem exhibited the most potent activity among the drugs tested. it inhibited all 330 strains of enterobacteriaceae at 0.78 mg/l. meropenem was sensitive against several cephem-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem was four-fold more  active than imipenem and eight-fold more active than ceftazidime, with an mic90 of 0.78 mg/l. the therapeutic effect of meropenem on systemic infection in mice was ten to twenty-fold less than that of imipenem against staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. however, meropenem was as effective as imipenem on infections of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. meropenem was eliminated from mice plasma two-fold faster than imipenem, with a plasma half-life of 7.6 min. from the above results the authors concluded that meropenem is a promising drug for clinical use.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  == cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its mic90 is 0.125 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for haemophilus spp., neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of m. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. less than 1 mg/l is needed for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus spp. and shigella spp. the mic90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, morganella morganii, providencia spp. and most strains of serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp. and enterobacter spp. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and most strains of pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. cefodizime has high affinity for pbp 3 and pbp ia and ib (escherichia coli); in s. aureus it shows the highest affinity for pbp 1.

AB  == bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefdinir (cfdn, fk482),  a new oral cephalosporin, 5% and 10% granules, were performed in the field of pediatrics. the results are summarized below. 1. antibacterial activities antibacterial activities of cfdn against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were studied in comparison with those of cefaclor (ccl), cefixime (cfix) and amoxicillin (ampc).  mic80's of cfdn against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, h. influenzae, b.  catarrhalis, k. pneumoniae and e. coli were 0.78, 0.20, less than or equal to 0.025, 0.39, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively. these results show  that cfdn has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. mic80's of cfdn against gram-positive bacteria were similar to those of ampc, and was lower  than those of ccl and cfix. as for antibacterial activities against gram-negative bacteria (gnb), the mic80 of cfix against h. influenzae was 0.05 micrograms/ml, which was slightly lower than that of cfdn. the mic80's of cfdn against other gnb were similar to those of cfix. 2. absorption and excretion blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of cfdn 5% and 10% granules and 100 mg capsule were determined. the data on cfdn 10% granules were similar to those on cfdn 5% granules. at a dose of 3 mg/kg, peak blood concentrations (cmax's) of cfdn ranged from 0.20 to 2.12 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and from 0.50 to 1.15 micrograms/ml with 10% granules at 2 to 3 hours after dosing. at a dose of 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 0.66-2.06 micrograms/ml and 0.70-1.52 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and with 10% granules, respectively. at 8 hours after dosing, blood concentrations were 0.04-0.54 micrograms/ml at 3 mg/kg and 0.06-0.27 micrograms/ml at 6 mg/kg. blood half-lives were 1.33-4.36 hours at 3 mg/kg and 1.14-3.27 hours at 6 mg/kg. auc's were 1.7-11.0 micrograms.hr/ml with 3 mg/kg and 2.4-8.7 micrograms.hr/ml with 6 mg/kg. with administration of single 100 mg capsule, cmax's, blood concentrations after 8 hours, t1/2's and auc's were 0.79-1.88 micrograms/ml, 0.20 micrograms/ml, 1.54-2.72 hours, and 5.2 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours ranged from 6.85 to 39.2% with 3 mg/kg and 6.08-25.5% with 6 mg/kg.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == temperature-sensitive immunoglobulin a-binding and dimerization of c-terminus-impaired protein arp4 produced in escherichia coli.
AB  == a gene for protein arp4, an iga receptor protein derived from streptococcus pyogenes ap4, was expressed in escherichia coli. the product was demonstrated to  be accumulated in a periplasmic space as a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 40 kda with the deleted c-terminal membrane anchor portion of protein arp4. this 40-kda peptide of the c-terminus-impaired recombinant protein arp4 produced in e. coli, designated ir-protein arp4, was purified from a periplasmic  fraction of transformants and its iga-binding activity was analyzed. the iga binding of ir-protein arp4 was temperature-sensitive, that is, ir-protein arp4 bound iga at 4 and 25 c, but did not at 37 c. in addition, the dimerization of ir-protein arp4 was also temperature-sensitive in parallel with temperature-dependent binding activity, suggesting that the dimerization of ir-protein arp4 may be required for its active binding to iga. in contrast, ir-protein arp4 immobilized on sepharose 4b did bind to iga even at 37 c as well  as 4 and 25 c. the immobilized ir-protein arp4 might acquire the temperature-resistant iga binding activity in part through the formation of a stable dimerized ir-protein arp4 on the solid support.

TI  == [preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  == the authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (ifp) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. the infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with ifp as well as in recommended standard media. solid media used for cultivation of s. pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, n. meningitidis and c. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. all of these strains grew on the media prepared with ifp except s.  pneumoniae when cultured in ifp diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. only s. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. no more  differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. the growth of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and b. subtilis was  measured in liquid media after 8 hours. in solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in ifp-agar and nutriente agar by the number of colonies on trypticase soy agar plates. some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated  in standard media. the average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of ifp was 5.03 mg/ml. the experiments showed that culture media prepared with ifp supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. it suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.

TI  == evaluation of the bactericidal activity of temafloxacin.
AB  == although the fluoroquinolones share many properties, these agents differ in their ability to kill the same bacterial strain. the bactericidal activity of temafloxacin against a number of pathogens has been compared with that of other fluoroquinolones by determination of minimal bactericidal concentration, time-kill kinetics, and postantibiotic effect. studies have demonstrated that temafloxacin has equivalent or superior ability to kill when compared with other  fluoroquinolones. temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and pd 117558 were more active than other fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium avium complex, with 90% minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc90s; 8-16 micrograms/ml) four- to eightfold greater than 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic90s; 2 micrograms/ml). against chlamydia trachomatis the mic90 and mbc90 of temafloxacin were both 0.25  microgram/ml; ciprofloxacin was less active (mbc90 twice the mic90), and norfloxacin was least active. temafloxacin demonstrated more rapid killing kinetics than did ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin at all concentrations tested against streptococcus pyogenes. findings were similar against streptococcus pneumoniae at antibiotic concentrations of 1-2 micrograms/ml. similar time-kill curves against  escherichia coli were observed for temafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and difloxacin. time-kill kinetics of temafloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) were superior to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. postantibiotic effect with temafloxacin against legionella pneumophila showed a considerable delay in regrowth, and temafloxacin  delayed regrowth of mrsa and mssa to a greater extent than did ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. by the three methods used in the studies to assess bactericidal activity that are currently published, temafloxacin had equivalent or superior activity to the comparative fluoroquinolones tested. other organisms remain to be tested and the significance of these findings determined in clinical studies.

TI  == [bactericidal effect of cefadroxil, amoxicillin alone or in combination with clavulanic acid in sera of healthy volunteers].
AB  == determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) provides data on the susceptibility or resistance of a bacteria; however, in susceptible bacteria this parameter is not predictive of effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent. bactericidal activities of cefadroxil, of amoxicillin, and of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on bacteria commonly found in ent and lower respiratory tract disease were studied comparatively. the antibiotics were  given by the oral route to six healthy volunteers. with beta-lactamase-producing  and non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of escherichia coli, amoxicillin produced mics consistent with susceptibility but failed to exhibit a bactericidal effect, whereas cefadroxil was bactericidal. combination of amoxicillin with an inhibitor did not modify this activity on e. coli and failed to produce a bactericidal effect on klebsiella pneumoniae similar to that seen with cefadroxil. amoxicillin with and without clavulanic acid exhibited comparable effectiveness on streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. the bactericidal effect of cefadroxil on s. pneumoniae was of similar magnitude but shorter duration than that of amoxicillin. cefadroxil and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination had similar bactericidal effects against staphylococcus aureus. these antibiotics exhibited a time-dependent effect on gram positive microorganisms. these pharmacodynamic data, together with measures of bactericidal activity, may  be very helpful for selecting the appropriate antibiotic and dosage.

TI  == a host factor absent from lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis mg1363 is required for conjugative transposition.
AB  == in matings between lactococcus lactis strains, the conjugative transposons tn916  and tn919 are found in the chromosome of the transconjugants in the same place as in the chromosome of the donor, indicating that no transposition has occurred. in agreement with this, the frequency of l. lactis transconjugants from intraspecies matings is the same whether the donor contains the wild-type form of the transposon or the mutant tn916-int1, which has an insertion in the transposon's integrase gene. however, in intergeneric crosses with bacillus subtilis or enterococcus faecalis donors, tn916 and tn919 transpose to different locations on the chromosome of the l. lactis transconjugants. moreover, tn916 and tn919 could  not be transferred by conjugation from l. lactis and b. subtilis, e. faecalis or  streptococcus pyogenes. this suggests that excision of these elements does not occur in l. lactis. when cloned into e. coli with adjacent chromosomal dna from l. lactis, the conjugative transposons were able to excise, transpose and promote conjugation. therefore, the inability of these elements to excise in l. lactis is not caused by a permanent structural alteration in the transposon. we conclude that l. lactis lacks a factor required for excision of conjugative transposons.

AB  == inhibition experiments were performed to study the specificity of igg-class antibody, binding to cardiolipin immobilized onto a polystyrene surface, in sera  from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) or infection. six different phospholipids (three anionic: cardiolipin, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid, and three neutral: phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and platelet activating factor), lipopolysaccharide from salmonella minnesota (relps), strain re595 and lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus pyogenes were used as inhibitors, in the form of liposomes. eight of fifteen sle sera exhibited strong reactivity to phosphatidylserine liposomes; other anionic phospholipids, cardiolipin and phosphatidic acid, were less effective inhibitors. the binding was inhibited effectively only by cardiolipin in three of the sle sera, and by none of the anionic phospholipids tested in the remaining four sle sera. in most  sera from patients with bacterial infections (including syphilis), anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aca) were inhibited only by cardiolipin, but in some cases also by phosphatidic acid. in gram-negative infections, aca were inhibited  by relps more effectively than by cardiolipin. relps also inhibited aca in two of five chlamydial sera. appreciable inhibition of aca by phosphatidylserine did not occur in infections. thus, in contrast to previous studies, broad reactivity to anionic phospholipids occurred in only about half of sle sera. this pattern of polyreactivity was not seen in infections.

TI  == lack of emergence of significant resistance in vitro and in vivo to the new azalide antibiotic azithromycin.
AB  == in vitro experiments were performed in which 6 to 12 strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae were passaged nine times in sub-lethal concentrations of azithromycin or control  antibiotics. streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus quickly became resistant to rifampin as the mic90 increased from 0.1 to greater than 50 micrograms/ml for both species. the mic90 of azithromycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin and cefaclor increased by three dilutions for staphylococcus aureus.  the mic values of azithromycin for streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae and enterobacteriaceae strains did not change significantly. however, for haemophilus influenzae and the enterobacteriaceae strains, the mic values of erythromycin and oral cephalosporins increased four-fold. in the in vivo experiments, mice infected with staphylococcus aureus or escherichia coli contaminated sutures were administered azithromycin for three days, and on day 6  viable bacterial cells were recovered from the infection site. the sustained tissue concentrations of azithromycin indicated that the organisms would have been continuously exposed to azithromycin at the site of infection. colonies isolated from azithromycin-treated and non-treated mice were cultured and their susceptibility to azithromycin compared. the azithromycin mic values for staphylococcus aureus cultures from treated and non-treated animals were identical. the azithromycin mics for escherichia coli recovered from treated animals were on average, less than one dilution higher than for control cultures. emergence of significant resistance to azithromycin in the laboratory was not observed with the pathogens tested.

TI  == pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics in vitro.
AB  == the pharmacodynamic effects of subinhibitory concentrations of different beta-lactam antibiotics were investigated. a postantibiotic effect (pae) was induced for different bacterial species by exposure to 10x mic of several beta-lactam antibiotics for 2 h in vitro. the antibiotic-bacterial combinations used in this study were imipenem-pseudomonas aeruginosa, benzylpenicillin-streptococcus pneumoniae and -streptococcus pyogenes, cefcanel-s. pyogenes, ampicillin-escherichia coli, and piperacillin-e. coli. after the induction of the pae, the exposed cultures as well as the unexposed controls were washed and diluted. thereafter, the cultures in the postantibiotic  phase (pa phase) and the cultures not previously treated with antibiotics were exposed to 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3x mic of the relevant drug and the growth curves were compared. when bacteria in the pa phase were exposed to sub-mics, a substantial prolongation of the time before regrowth was demonstrated, especially in antibiotic-bacterial combinations for which a pae was found. in contrast, sub-mics on cultures not previously exposed to suprainhibitory antibiotic concentrations yielded only a slight reduction in growth rate compared with the controls. thus, it seems important to distinguish the direct effects of sub-mics  on bacteria not previously exposed to suprainhibitory concentrations from the effects of sub-mics on bacteria in the pa phase.

AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == bacteriology of community acquired urinary tract infection. analysis of 1048 cases.
AB  == urine samples from 1048 cases clinically suspected to have urinary tract infection were examined for bacteriological culture and antibiotic sensitivity. of 1048 cultures, 530 (50.5%) were sterile, 163 (15.5%) showed the presence of nonpathogenic bacteria and 11 (1%) revealed nonsignificant bacteriuria with escherichia coli. significant bacteriuria (more than 10(5)/ml) was found in the remaining 344 (32.8%) cases. escherichia coli was the predominant pathogen isolated from 170 (16.2%) samples; klebsiella aerogenes was the next in order, found in 46 (4.3%) cases. streptococcus pyogenes was isolated in 37 (3.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa in 29 (2.7%), proteus mirabilis in 26 (2.4%), streptococcus faecalis in 21 (2.0%), staphylococcus aureus in 12 (1%) and citrobacter freundii in 3 cases. nalidixic acid was the most effective drug against gram negative organisms. nitrofurantoin was the next antibiotic of choice, whereas cephalexin was the third drug in order of sensitivity. ampicillin was the first drug of choice in infection with gram positive cocci, followed by nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, cephalexin and cephaloridine. the results of sensitivity tests emphasise the problem of multiple drug resistance in our community.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  == cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and  negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. cefcanel had excellent activity against  methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, mic90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. however, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, mic greater than or equal to  16 micrograms/ml. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the mics were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for bacteroides spp. the mic90 for moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the mics of cefixime. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, mics greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and  50% of enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii were resistant. cefcanel was hydrolyzed by tem-1, tem-3 and moraxella bro-1 beta-lactamases. escherichia coli  containing tem-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel mics of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited haemophilus influenzae carrying tem-1.

TI  == expression of the fibronectin-binding components of streptococcus pyogenes in escherichia coli demonstrates that they are proteins.
AB  == the fibronectin-binding components (fbcs) of two clinical isolates and a culture  collection strain of streptococcus pyogenes have been analysed. western immunoblotting of bacterial lysates which had been fractionated on polyacrylamide gels revealed trypsin-sensitive fibronectin-binding species. the genes specifying the fbcs were cloned from all three strains and expressed in escherichia coli using a lambda embl3 vector. an fbc gene from the culture collection strain was subcloned and expressed in the e. coli expression vector pjla601, and subjected to deletion analysis. the fibronectin-binding domain was thereby localized within a 40 kda truncated peptide encoded by the 1000 bp c-terminal region of the gene.  southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that the analysed gene was present in the parental s. pyogenes chromosome, but not in the dna of fbc expressing lambda clones obtained from the two clinical isolates. further evidence for the existence of at least two different types of fbcs in group a streptococci was provided by western blot analysis of recombinant phage lysates which revealed a complex series of fibronectin-binding species ranging from 120 to 200 kda in size and showing strain-dependent variation in their patterns. as was the case with parental streptococcal strains all of the recombinant fbcs were protease-sensitive, and treatment with trypsin or pronase resulted in a total loss of fibronectin-binding activity. competitive inhibition experiments indicated that lipoteichoic acid was not a significant fbc in the tested streptococcal strains.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == expression and immunogenicity of a streptococcal m protein epitope inserted in salmonella flagellin.
AB  == a synthetic 48-bp oligonucleotide specifying the n-terminal 15 amino acids of m protein of streptococcus pyogenes type 5 (plus a cta codon, to terminate translation of genes with the insert in reverse orientation) was inserted by blunt-end ligation at the site of the 48-bp ecorv deletion in the salmonella flagellin gene in plasmid pls408 (s. m. c. newton, c. o. jacob, and b. a. d. stocker, science 244: 70-72, 1989). the resulting plasmid was transferred from escherichia coli via a restriction-negative salmonella typhimurium strain into an aromatic-compound-dependent, flagellin-negative live-vaccine strain of salmonella dublin to produce strain sl7127, which was motile. expression of the inserted epitope in flagellin and its exposure at the flagellar filament surface were shown by immunoblotting and by the reaction of flagellate bacteria (immobilization, immunogold labeling) with antibody raised by injection of the corresponding synthetic peptide, s-m5(1-15). rabbits immunized by injection of the live-vaccine strain with flagella composed of the chimeric flagellin or by injection of concentrated flagella from such bacteria developed antibodies reactive in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with peptide s-m5(1-15) and with the large peptic-digest peptide pepm5. these antibodies were opsonic for type 5 streptococci. mice that were given parenteral live sl7127 (six doses, each 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6), over 8 weeks) developed titers of ca. 12,800 for the m5-specific peptides and opsonizing activity for type 5 streptococci but not for  type 24 streptococci. sera from mice similarly immunized with a control live vaccine strain without an insert in the flagellin gene did not react with the m5-specific antigens. all of the five mice given the control strain, without an insert, died after challenge with type 5 streptococci or type 24 streptococci; by contrast, four of the five mice given strain sl7127, with an insert, survived the m5 challenge, but none of the five challenged with the type 24 strain survived. therefore, our study shows that an m protein epitope can be expressed in the context of an unrelated protein and maintain its immunogenicity. furthermore, we  demonstrate that mice can be protected against a streptococcus pyogenes type 5 challenge by immunization with a salmonella live vaccine with flagella made of flagellin with an insert carrying a protective epitope of m5 protein but without  the cross-reactive epitopes of the complete protein.

TI  == possible role of streptococcus pyogenes in mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. xi. immunoelectron microscopic observation of protoplast-like "spherical bodies" detected in peripheral blood of mcls patients.
AB  == protoplast-like "spherical bodies" averaging 0.5-1.5 microns in diameter and devoid of cell walls were first detected by ueno et al, in the buffy coat of heparinized venous blood from patients with mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (mcls). but the nature of the "bodies" has yet to be clarified because of the absence of convincing evidence pointing to their antigenic characteristics. the present investigations were designed solely to provide a serological identification of the "bodies" by the use of immunoelectron microscopy, with the  following results. first, "spherical bodies" bearing a striking resemblance to those observed by the above-mentioned authors were detected in biopsy specimens from challenge sites in mice infected with streptococcus pyogenes as well as in the buffy coat of peripheral blood from mcls patients. second, the "bodies" detected were stained distinctly in both cases by an immunohistochemical technique using, as the primary antibody, a rabbit antiserum raised toward s. pyogenes-derived protoplasts, which was then absorbed with protoplasts from staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. third, the absorbed sera were proved  to be not faultless, because complete specificity toward protoplasts from s. pyogenes was not attained due to the presence of a large amount of cross-reactive antigens between protoplasts from the immunizing and absorbing strains of bacteria. the implications of these findings are discussed, particularly in relation to the evaluation of the present serological test for the "spherical bodies".

TI  == aggregation of group a streptococci by human saliva and effect of saliva on streptococcal adherence to host cells.
AB  == the aggregation of group a streptococci by whole, stimulated human saliva (whs) and the effect of saliva on streptococcal adherence to host cells was investigated. whs samples from 11 individuals were found to aggregate both m+ and m- group a streptococci to various degrees. the aggregating activity was sensitive to heat, edta, egta [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid], sodium dodecyl sulfate, and lipoteichoic acid. none of the simple sugars tested, mercaptoethanol, albumin, or nonionic detergents had any effect on aggregation. the aggregating activity of edta-treated saliva was restored by 0.1 mm ca2+ and 1.0 mm mn2+ but not by up to  5 mm mg2+. only streptococci from the stationary phase were aggregated. hyaluronidase treatment of streptococci from the exponential phase of growth restored their ability to be aggregated, suggesting that the hyaluronic acid capsule interferes with agglutination. adsorption of whs by one strain of streptococcus pyogenes removed aggregating activity for other strains of s. pyogenes and streptococcus sanguis but not agglutinins for escherichia coli, suggesting that the agglutinin is specific for certain gram-positive bacteria. molecular sieve chromatography of whs and identification of streptococcus-binding components of saliva suggest that either a glycoprotein of approximately 360 kda  or a mucin of saliva of greater than 1,000 kda mediates aggregation of streptococci. whs also inhibited adherence of s. pyogenes to buccal epithelial cells.

AB  == gr69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (mic90). it had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and e-1040. against cephalosporinase-producing enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, and serratia marcescens, mics ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and  cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to gr69153, and for this organism the mic90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the e-1040 mic90, but most pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. gr69153 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. for staphylococcus aureus gr69153 mics were similar to those of ceftazidime and e-1040. enterococci and listeriae were resistant to gr69153, but streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. the activity of gr69153 was not affected by serum. gr69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of staphylococcus aureus, tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, and bro-1, but it was hydrolyzed by tem-3, tem-9, and morganellae. gr69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. it is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. gr69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.

TI  == the effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with bacteroides species. is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. in infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or  gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted  organism. the combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of b. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with s. aureus and s. pyogenes. these findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.

AB  == the dna repeat region of fcra76, the gene encoding a group a streptococcal fc-binding protein, was subcloned in-frame into an escherichia coli plasmid expression vector. the expressed protein product displayed the same fc-binding properties as the full-length fc-binding protein expressed from fcra76. the affinity-purified, full-length fc-binding protein was found to compete with staphylococcal protein a or streptococcal protein g for binding to beads coated with human igg. these results are consistent with earlier studies suggesting that the binding sites on human igg for protein a, protein g and the type ii fc-binding protein from group a streptococci are located at the interface of the  ch2 and ch3 domains of the fc region.

TI  == carboxyhydrazides of the aglycone of teicoplanin. synthesis and antibacterial activity.
AB  == the condensation of the terminal carboxyl group of the deglucoteicoplanin (td) with various substituted hydrazines produced hydrazide derivatives having different physico-chemical properties. this chemical modification of the carboxyl function does not affect the ability of teicoplanin antibiotics to interfere in bacterial cell-wall synthesis. the antibacterial activity of deglucoteicoplanin hydrazides (v) were found to depend mostly on their ionic character. all the hydrazides were slightly more active than td on escherichia coli. those possessing an additional basic group were more in vitro active than td against gram-negative microorganisms. in experimental streptococcus pyogenes septicemia in the mouse, basic hydrazides were more active than other derivatives when administered subcutaneously although they are as potent as td.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == inability of toxin inhibitors to neutralize enhanced toxicity caused by bacteria  adherent to tissue culture cells.
AB  == toxicity to y-1 adrenal mouse cells caused by heat-labile toxin secreted by an enterotoxigenic strain of escherichia coli (h-10407-p) was 40-fold enhanced in mixtures containing organisms capable of adhering to the y-1 cells compared with  monolayers exposed to organisms whose adherence was inhibited by mannoside. severalfold the concentrations of anti-heat-labile toxin antibodies required to neutralize the toxicity of nonadherent bacteria were unable to neutralize the toxicity caused by adherent bacteria. the cytolytic activity toward tissue culture cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages caused by streptolysin s carried by streptococcus pyogenes was severalfold increased in mixtures containing organisms capable of adhering to the target cells compared with mixtures containing nonadherent bacteria. the ability of trypan blue and rna core to inhibit the cell-bound streptolysin s was determined in tissue culture cells containing adherent streptococci and mixtures of streptococci randomly colliding  with erythrocytes. both inhibitors were markedly less effective in neutralizing cytolysis than in their ability to neutralize hemolysis. we conclude that compared with toxins produced by nonadherent bacteria, those produced by bacteria adherent to cells are targeted more efficiently and become relatively inaccessible to neutralization by toxin inhibitors.

TI  == regulation of human monocyte/macrophage function by extracellular matrix. adherence of monocytes to collagen matrices enhances phagocytosis of opsonized bacteria by activation of complement receptors and enhancement of fc receptor function.
AB  == in inflammation monocytes emigrate from the peripheral circulation into an extravascular area rich in extracellular matrix proteins. in this milieu, phagocytes ingest and kill invading pathogens. in the present studies, we found that monocytes adhered to type i collagen gels phagocytized 2.5-12-fold more opsonized escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae than plastic-adherent monocytes. the rate of phagocytosis and the number of bacteria ingested by collagen-adherent monocytes was equal to, or greater than, the number of bacteria ingested by 7-d cultured macrophages (m phi). although both collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes were  bactericidal for e. coli and s. aureus, more bacteria were killed by collagen-adherent monocytes by virtue of their enhanced phagocytic capacity. cultured m phi only were bacteriostatic. adherence of monocytes to collagen gels  activated c receptors (cr) types 1 and 3 for phagocytosis, and enhanced fc receptor (fcr)-mediated phagocytosis. collagen- and plastic-adherent monocytes produced equivalent amounts of superoxide anion in response to phorbol myristate  acetate and opsonized zymosan. thus, the enhanced phagocytosis and killing of opsonized bacteria by collagen-adherent monocytes appear to be by regulation of the function of membrane cr and fcr, without apparent enhancement of the respiratory burst. these data suggest that adherence of monocytes to the extracellular matrix during inflammation may rapidly activate these cells for enhanced phagocytic bactericidal activity.

TI  == aromatic-dependent salmonella as live vaccine presenters of foreign epitopes as inserts in flagellin.
AB  == synthetic oligonucleotides specifying amino acid sequences identified as epitopes of various foreign antigens (cholera toxin subunit b, hepatitis b surface protein and others) have been inserted at an ecorv-ecorv deletion site in a cloned salmonella flagellin gene; the resulting plasmids, when placed in flagellin-negative escherichia coli or salmonella sp. strains, caused production  of flagellin expressing the epitope. if the chimeric flagellin allowed formation  of flagella, the epitope was exposed at the surface of the flagellar filaments. a delta aroa flagellin-negative s. dublin live vaccine strain given plasmids carrying various chimeric flagellin genes was administered to mice, etc. serum antibody specific for the foreign epitope was in all cases evoked by parenteral administration; oral route administration was effective in the case of two epitopes of hepatitis b surface protein but not effective for several other epitopes. several i.p. inocula of the live vaccine strain with an insert corresponding to the 15 n-terminal amino acids of the m protein of streptococcus  pyogenes type 5 evoked m-specific antibody with opsonic activity, and the mice were (incompletely) protected against a lethal challenge of s. pyogenes type 5. the non-virulence of salmonella sp. strains with complete blocks in the aromatic  biosynthesis pathway, even for animals with genetically determined or other defects in host defences, can be completely accounted for by their requirement for p-aminobenzoic acid, since non-leaky pabb mutations caused similar attenuation. two transposon insertions at aroe caused little or no attenuation, presumably because they did not result in complete block of the relevant step in  biosynthesis. the limited growth of delta aroa strains in mouse tissues parallels that which precedes the bacteriostasis caused by addition of a sulphonamide to a  growing broth culture of a sulphonamide-sensitive strain; the final cessation of  growth in each case presumably results from inability to initiate new protein chains with a formyl-methionine unit when the original folic acid content of the  bacteria has been diluted out by residual growth.

AB  == twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of fusarium solani and f. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited  to inhibition of phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil in a pharmacokinetic in-vitro model.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil was studied in an in-vitro model simulating doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg. strains of klebsiella spp. proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and haemophilus influenzae were effectively reduced by a dose of 200 mg. while for esch. coli no dose-activity relationship was observed--the maximal effect was achieved with a simulated dose of 100 mg--staphylococcus aureus could be reduced effectively only by a simulated dose of 400 mg. the lower doses showed stepwise lower activities.  apart from broad spectrum beta-lactamases like shv 2 or tem 5 the presence of plasmid coded beta-lactamases in esch. coli and h. influenzae did not affect the  antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime proxetil. the results show that cefpodoxime was more active against gram-negative bacteria than amoxycillin, and comparable activity to intramuscular cefotiam in the in-vitro model.

AB  == several sequences, resembling vegetative promoters and ribosome-binding sites of  bacilli were found in the primary structure of the replication region of streptococci plasmid psm19035. promoterless alpha-amylase gene of bac. amyloliquefaciens and lambda ci857 gene, supplied with bamhi site upstream of the initiator atg-codon, were used for functional characterization of the structures. as a result, bac. subtilis synthesized alpha-amylase up to 0.5 g/l, and lambda-repressor up to 3% of the intracellular water-soluble protein. the repressor, synthesized in bac. subtilis, regulates lambda pr promoter in the cells. plasmid pcb22 is constructed for the convenience of usage of the found expression unit, called eu19035. the plasmid has bamhi and bgiii sites on different distances from the ribosome-binding site.

TI  == clinical, pathologic, and microbiologic findings of foot abscess in neonatal pigs.
AB  == a longitudinal study was undertaken in a swine herd with an ever-present problem  of foot abscess in suckling pigs reared on a woven-wire floor. of 3,322 4-day-old pigs, 199 (6%) developed abscess lesions involving claws and accessory digits before weaning. lesions were first detected in 4-day-old pigs; median and mean ages at onset were 10 and 11.3 days, respectively. at first detection, most pigs  had only a single claw affected, but 39 pigs had at least 2 claws with abscesses. hind limbs had more affected claws (140) than forelimbs (96). in the hind limbs,  medial claws were most likely to have lesions, whereas the reverse was true for the forelimbs. gross and microscopic examinations of affected claws indicated necrotic pododermatitis, with severe osteomyelitis, arthritis, and tenosynovitis. bacteria isolated from foot abscess lesions included actinomyces pyogenes, staphylococcus spp, beta-hemolytic streptococcus spp, actinobacillus spp, escherichia coli, fusobacterium spp, bacteroides spp, and peptostreptococcus spp.

TI  == sequence and structural characteristics of the trypsin-resistant t6 surface protein of group a streptococci.
AB  == the gene for the trypsin-resistant surface t6 protein of streptococcus pyogenes d471 (m type 6) was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene (tee6) and its flanking regions was determined and found to include only one major open reading frame coding for a protein of 537 amino acids (mr, 57,675). the n terminus of the deduced protein sequence exhibits features of a typical signal sequence, and the c-terminal segment was found to have a high degree of homology with the membrane anchor region of other  gram-positive surface proteins, such as streptococcal m protein, wapa protein from streptococcus mutans and staphylococcal protein a. a hexapeptide having the  consensus sequence lpstge and located immediately upstream of the c-terminal hydrophobic segment showed the highest degree of conservation at both the protein and dna levels, with nearly all reported surface proteins from gram-positive cocci. the amino acid composition of the t6 protein revealed 21% serine and threonine residues distributed nearly regularly throughout the molecule, and analysis of the secondary structure predicted a conformation composed of greater  than 70% beta-sheet potential interrupted by beta-turns or random coils. localization experiments in e. coli show very little t6 protein in the periplasmic space. when found here, however, this t6 protein had a molecular mass of 55 kilodaltons, similar to that extracted from the streptococci by nonionic detergent. most of the t6 protein was found localized in the membrane fraction, where it was composed of a triple band of 60, 58, and 57 kilodaltons. the coexistence of streptococcal surface proteins which are either resistant (t protein) or sensitive (m protein) to proteolytic enzymes may offer a new dimension to the modulation of these antigens under specific biological conditions.

TI  == streptococcal-host interactions. structural and functional analysis of a streptococcus sanguis receptor for a human salivary glycoprotein.
AB  == colonization of oral tissues by streptococcus sanguis may be influenced by a mucin-like salivary glycoprotein (sag) through a calcium-dependent interaction with a specific bacterial receptor. we report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) and show that this protein may bind sialic acid residues of sag. the ssp-5 protein contains three unique structural domains, two of which consist of repetitive amino acid sequences. the  n-terminal domain is comprised of four tandem copies of an 82-residue repeat which exhibits homology to m protein of streptococcus pyogenes. this region is highly charged and predicted to be alpha-helical. a second hydrophilic repetitive domain consists of three copies of a 39-amino acid sequence containing 30% proline flanked by nonrepetitive proline-rich sequence. the third domain consists of 48% proline and resides near the c terminus of the protein. secondary structure analysis of the ssp-5 sequence also identified four potential helix-turn-helix motifs that resembled e-f hand calcium binding domains. the ssp-5 protein is highly homologous to a surface antigen expressed by the mutans streptococci and the domain structure of ssp-5 is conserved within this family of proteins. the interactions of ssp-5 and of intact s. sanguis with sag were inhibited by neuraminidase digestion of the salivary glycoprotein and by simple sugars containing sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is the primary ligand  involved in the binding reaction.

TI  == biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, win 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, win 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. agar inclusion and broth dilution  in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the  staphylococci. the mic for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (mic90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the mic90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. against enterococci the mic90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group a and group b streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. in general, the mic90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. exceptions were serratia marcescens (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml), citrobacter freundii (mic90,  4 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). the greatest potency was observed against haemophilus spp. and neisseria spp., with mic90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with mic90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. the in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for  all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. with the exception of the pseudomonas  infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. win 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial  infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).

TI  == protective effect of heterologous gram-positive vaccine against lethal upper respiratory tract infection with type m50 group a streptococci in mice.
AB  == type m50 group a streptococci are exceptional for their virulence in mice. however, intranasal (i.n.) vaccination with heat-killed group a streptococci, either of type m50 or m55, or an m12 strain deficient in m-protein, protected mice against i.n. challenge with m50 streptococci (82, 88 and 83% survival, respectively). significant resistance against m50 streptococci was also noted by  i.n. application of heat-killed lactobacillus fermenti (81% survival) as well as  two strains of pneumococci (50 and 79% survival). in contrast, no protective effect was obtained using heat-killed trypsin-treated m55 streptococci. nor did vaccination with escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa induce protection against type m50. thus, m protein was not required for immunity against type m50. the results call for a revision of the hitherto accepted view that m proteins are the only candidates for mucosal vaccines against group a streptococci.

TI  == differential binding of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus to corneal epithelium in culture.
AB  == adherence of bacteria to corneal epithelium is a prerequisite for corneal infection. we used two methods to study the binding of pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus to rabbit corneal epithelial cells in culture. in the first method, rabbit corneal epithelial cells grown on glass slides were incubated with p. aeruginosa or s. aureus (10(7) cfu/ml) at room temperature for 90 min, and the bacterial binding to the epithelial cells was examined by light microscopy. both  p. aeruginosa and s. aureus bound to epithelial cells. p. aeruginosa was bound to the cell periphery whereas s. aureus was bound randomly to the cell surface. in the second method, suspension cultures of corneal epithelial cells were used. in  contrast to the findings in cultures on slides, binding pattern with cells in suspension was similar for both species and resembled that for s. aureus in cultures on slides. a much greater number of p. aeruginosa (186 +/- 11 bacteria/epithelial cell) than s. aureus (30 +/- 1.5 bacteria/epithelial cell) bound to epithelial cells grown on glass slides. in contrast, a similar number of p. aeruginosa (25 +/- 5.1) and s. aureus (20 +/- 4.7) bound to epithelial cells grown in suspension cultures. using either method, escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes did not bind significantly (less than 5/cell) to corneal epithelial cells. the above methods should prove useful for characterization of bacterial binding to corneal epithelial cells in culture.

AB  == streptococcal c5a peptidase (scp), a recently discovered virulence factor of streptococcus pyogenes, specifically cleaves the human serum chemotaxin c5a near  its carboxyl terminus, destroying its ability to serve as a chemoattractant. we previously localized the scp gene, scpa, to the 5.8-kb insert of the recombinant  plasmid ptt1. here we present the complete nucleotide sequence of scpa and its flanking regions. the gene initiates at a ttg codon and consists of 3501 base pairs, specifying a precursor protein of 128,252 daltons. sequences resembling the promoter and ribosome-binding site of gram-positive organisms are found upstream of scpa. the predicted amino acid sequence reveals the presence of a 31-residue signal peptide, putative cell wall spanning and membrane anchor domains. regions of scp show significant similarity to the sequences involved in  the formation of the active site of the prokaryotic serine protease subtilisin. results of southern hybridization studies indicate that sequences highly similar  to that of scpa are present in all serotypes of s. pyogenes tested.

TI  == deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  == microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized s. pyogenes, s. aureus, and e. coli; ingestion of s. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, and s. epidermidis was moderate. peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. to find  out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (pma) or opsonized s. aureus. upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake  of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (sam), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with sam. the results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of s. epidermidis by these macrophages. the release of hydrogen peroxide by sam-pretreated peritoneal  macrophages upon stimulation with pma or opsonized s. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == microbiologic culture revealed the following cause of mastitis and anorexia in 145 cows in wisconsin to be escherichia coli, 66 cows; klebsiella spp, 3; corynebacterium pyogenes, 27; streptococci, 21; staphylococci, 20; yeasts, 1; and no bacterial growth, 7. mastitis was detected with approximately equal frequency  throughout the year. escherichia coli was isolated throughout the year, but was more common and was the predominant organism during the summer. corynebacterium pyogenes was isolated most often in winter and spring; streptococci in fall, winter, and spring; and staphylococci throughout the year. corynebacterium pyogenes caused most of the mastitis in nonlactating cows. escherichia coli, c pyogenes, streptococci, and staphylococci were isolated with about equal frequency at parturition, whereas e coli was the predominant cause of mastitis in early and late lactation. of cases of mastitis, 27% were seen 10 days before and  after parturition. local and systemic clinical signs of infection were similar for all causes, except that c pyogenes caused more (p less than 0.01) malodorous  and purulent milk than did other organisms and was isolated more commonly from quarters with injured teats. recovery was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher in cows with e coli infections, compared with recovery in cows with gram-positive organism infections. cows with c pyogenes infections frequently had quarters that ultimately ceased lactation. a few cows were recumbent at initiation of antimicrobial therapy and a few were not eating 24 hours later; however, 50% of these cows recovered. criteria such as season of year, stage of lactation, appearance of milk and udder, and appetite permitted the cause (gram-negative or  gram-positive organisms) of the mastitis to be predicted with 77% accuracy.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime,  and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012  micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it  did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella  species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8  micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == hematologic effects of exposure to three infective agents in rabbits.
AB  == infectious disease is typically accompanied by changes in the number and types of circulating leukocytes. to examine the effects of infectious challenge on the distribution of rabbit wbc, rabbits were inoculated iv with streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, or candida albicans. blood was collected prior to and every 6 to 12 hours after inoculation for 48 hours. infectious challenge did not  substantially alter total wbc counts, but did cause neutrophilia and lymphopenia  for 6 to 48 hours after inoculation. similar patterns of leukocyte distribution were observed in rabbits with naturally developing clinical problems. thus, high  total wbc counts may not be a common characteristic of acute infectious conditions in rabbits, but differential distributions of various leukocyte populations can provide useful markers of disease in this species.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem alp-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  == extensive sequence homology between iga receptor and m proteins in streptococcus  pyogenes.
AB  == many strains of streptococcus pyogenes are known to express a receptor for iga. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for such a receptor, protein arp4, has been determined. the deduced amino acid sequence of 386 residues includes a signal sequence of 41 amino acids and a putative membrane anchor region, both of  which are homologous to similar regions in other streptococcal surface proteins.  the processed form of the iga receptor has a length of 345 amino acids and a calculated molecular weight of 39544. the n-terminal sequence of the processed form is different from that previously found for a similar iga receptor isolated  from a s. pyogenes strain of type m60. the sequence of protein arp4 shows extensive homology to the c-terminal half of streptococcal m proteins, but not to the streptococcal igg receptor protein g or staphlyococcal protein a. apart from  the membrane anchor, this homology includes a sequence of 119 amino acid residues containing three repeated units and a 54-residue sequence without repeats. the protein expressed in escherichia coli is found in the periplasmic space, in which it constitutes the major protein. protein arp4 is the first example of a surface  protein that has both immunoglobulin-binding capacity and structural features characteristic of m proteins.

TI  == effects of microbial challenge on sleep in rabbits.
AB  == rabbits challenged with viable staphylococcus aureus exhibit marked time-dependent changes in sleep patterns. to examine the generality of this observation, we monitored sleep patterns for 24 h before and for 48 h after intravenous inoculation of rabbits with streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, or candida albicans. all three agents produced complex time-dependent changes in  sleep. inoculation with s. pyogenes or c. albicans increased the time spent in slow-wave sleep (sws) during h 4-20 after challenge. electroencephalographic delta wave amplitudes (dwa) increased during h 4-8 after injection, but decreased during h 24-38 after inoculation. altered sleep patterns were not observed when similar doses of heat-killed organisms were administered. in contrast, inoculation with e. coli produced a large increase in both sws time and dwa for the first 2-4 h after inoculation. dwa then decreased from 6 to 32 h after inoculation. similar effects occurred when heat-killed e. coli were administered. rapid eye movement sleep was reduced by all three agents. these data demonstrate  that altered sleep patterns occur in response to infectious challenge in rabbits, and that these changes are related to the type of infectious organism involved.

TI  == [bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the pediatric field].
AB  == bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (cpdx-pr, cs-807), a new oral cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. antibacterial activities of r-3746 (na-salt of cefpodoxime (cpdx] against clinically isolated strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were compared with those of cefaclor, cephalexin and cefadroxil. r-3746 is superior to other antibiotics against s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. catarrhalis and gram-negative rods. 2. serum concentrations of cpdx after administration of cpdx-pr at doses of 3 mg/kg (fasting), 6 mg/kg (non-fasting) and 6 mg/kg (fasting) were determined. mean auc  (area under curve)'s of cpdx obtained were 9.60, 31.35 and 17.89 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively for the 3 dosages. the mean half-lives of cpdx were 3.35, 1.88 and 1.76 hours, respectively. the mean urinary recovery rate within 8 hours after administration of cpdx-pr at a dose of 3 mg/kg (fasting) was 39.2%. 3. cpdx-pr was administered to 37 pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (pyelonephritis 9, cystitis 4, pneumonia 7, acute bronchitis 3, otitis media 2, tonsillitis 10, subcutaneous abscess 1 and purulent lymphadenitis 1). the overall clinical efficacy rate was 91.9% and the overall bacteriological eradication rate was also 91.9%. 4. no adverse reactions were observed. abnormal laboratory findings were moderate, eosinophilia in 2 and slight elevation of got and gpt in 1. the taste and the odor of the cpdx-pr preparation was sufficiently tolerable. from the above results we have concluded  that cpdx-pr is a useful oral antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == effect of immune globulin intravenous on opsonization of bacteria by classic and  alternative complement pathways in premature serum.
AB  == the mechanisms involved in the effect of immune globulin intravenous (igiv) on bacterial opsonization by both complement pathways in premature serum were elucidated in this study. of the bacteria used, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis were nonencapsulated while streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli 07 k1 were encapsulated. as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, igiv showed specific antibody titers of 1:32 for s. aureus and s. enteritidis and of 1:8 for s. pyogenes and e. coli 07 k1. igiv alone had no direct opsonic activity against these organisms. addition of igiv did not alter the opsonic activity of normal adult serum against these organisms. in contrast, addition of igiv promoted the opsonic activity of premature serum against the nonencapsulated bacteria to levels matching that in normal adult serum. the igiv preparation significantly improved the opsonization of bacteria by the classic (from 39 to 68% of that in adult serum) and alternative (from 22 to 97% of that in adult serum) complement pathways in premature serum. igiv also  markedly augmented c3 deposition on the bacteria by both complement pathways. these studies suggest that igiv containing high titers of specific antibodies promote opsonization of bacteria by the enhancement of complement pathway activation, especially the alternative pathway, in premature serum.

TI  == enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == necrobacillosis is caused by fusobacterium necrophorum (fn), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. their possible role was studied in experiments  made with a virulent fn strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously)  were given. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with fn suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. undiluted culture of a strain of escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of fn to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered e. coli. a heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of e. coli culture had little if any effect on fn. citrobacter freundii  and comparatively small numbers of corynebacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of e. coli. an alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of fn, though less strikingly than e. coli. fn increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and b. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.

TI  == cloning and expression of the streptococcal c5a peptidase gene in escherichia coli: linkage to the type 12 m protein gene.
AB  == a genomic library of streptococcus pyogenes cs24 dna was constructed by cloning streptococcal dna partially digested with sau3a into the lambda replacement vector embl3. the expression of streptococcal c5a peptidase (scp) was analyzed by radioimmunoassay with hyperimmune rabbit serum. two clones, lambda 4.1 and lambda 4.2, were found to express the desired antigen, and various dna fragments from the hybrid bacteriophage lambda 4.1 were subcloned into the plasmid vector puc9 in escherichia coli. one of the recombinant plasmids, designated ptt1, contained  a 5.8-kilobase (kb) streptococcal dna insert. analysis of total cellular protein  from this e. coli clone by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western (immuno-) blotting identified a 140,000-mr protein, similar in size to the native protein purified from s. pyogenes. cloned scp was functionally active, as shown by its ability to inhibit c5a-mediated chemotaxis.  by deletion analysis with both restriction endonucleases and bal 31 nuclease, the scp gene was localized to a 4.3-kb segment of dna. southern hybridization experiments showed that the type 12 m protein-coding sequence is also present in  the hybrid phage lambda 4.1, at approximately 2 kb upstream of the scp structural gene. western blot analysis indicated that the cloned streptococcal dna in lambda 4.1 directed the expression of both scp and m12 protein.

TI  == comparative activity of cefixime and cefaclor in an in vitro model simulating human pharmacokinetics.
AB  == the dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. in the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. the more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml)  of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). as a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic  properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.

TI  == bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin sc 47111 (ny-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  == the bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x mic)  and suprainhibitory (4 x mic) concentrations. five strains each of the following  microorganisms were studied: streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. we found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by mics. however, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x mic and 4 x mic were tested. for many of  the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. the low mics seen for the gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x mic were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.

AB  == two genes coding for cell surface proteins were cloned from a group a streptococcus type m4: the gene for an iga binding protein and the gene for a fibrinogen binding protein. both proteins were purified and partially characterized after expression in escherichia coli. there was no immunological cross-reaction between the two proteins. the iga binding protein, called protein  arp4, is similar to an iga receptor previously purified from another strain of group a streptococci, but the proteins are not identical. characterization of many independent clones showed that the two proteins described here are coded for by closely linked genes. bacterial mutants have been found which have simultaneously lost the ability to express both genes, and a simple method to isolate such mutants is described. the existence of these variants indicates that expression of the two cell surface proteins may be coordinately regulated. binding of fibrinogen is a characteristic property of streptococcal m proteins, and the available evidence suggests that the fibrinogen binding protein is indeed an m protein.

TI  == serine and tyrosine protein kinase activities in streptococcus pyogenes. phosphorylation of native and synthetic peptides of streptococcal m proteins.
AB  == two forms of protein kinase activity were isolated from crude extracts of streptococcus pyogenes and partially purified by ion exchange chromatography and  affinity chromatography. the phosphorylation activities were shown to be insensitive to camp, required the presence of divalent cations, and eluted from a sephadex g-200 column with approximate molecular masses of 60 and 45 kda, respectively. both enzymes were capable of phosphorylating eukaryotic proteins and synthetic polypeptides in addition to endogenous and heterologous prokaryotic proteins at serine and tyrosine residues. firm evidence for tyrosine kinase activity was obtained by the use of a tyrosine kinase-specific substrate, a 4:1 glutamate:tyrosine copolymer. both protein kinases phosphorylated hpr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system isolated from s. pyogenes and bacillus stearothermophilus, but failed to phosphorylate hpr isolated from escherichia coli. both also phosphorylated a native polypeptide fragment (pep m24) as well as synthetic peptide copies of m protein, the major virulence determinant of group a streptococci. these results indicate that prokaryotic protein kinases are capable of phosphorylating eukaryotic proteins and suggest that the protein kinases of streptococci may play an important role not only in the phosphotransferase system but also in the virulence properties of these organisms.

TI  == receptor for iga in group a streptococci: cloning of the gene and characterization of the protein expressed in escherichia coli.
AB  == the gene for an iga-binding protein from a group a streptococcal strain was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the iga-binding protein, called protein arp, was purified on iga-sepharose, allowing complete purification in a single step. analysis of protein arp by western immunoblotting demonstrated a major iga-binding band, with an apparent molecular weight of 42 kd. the purified protein was shown to bind serum iga and secretory iga, as well as monoclonal iga  of both subclasses. there was no binding to igm, igd or ige, but a weak binding to igg. inhibition experiments with whole bacteria indicated that iga and igg bind at separate sites. experiments with immunoglobulin fragments showed that protein arp binds to the fc region of both iga and igg. the equilibrium constant  of the reaction between protein arp and polyclonal human iga was determined to be 5.6 x 10(8) m-1. amino acid sequencing of protein arp demonstrated a direct repeat of 7 amino acids in the nh2-terminal region, a feature previously found in several streptococcal m proteins. this suggests that protein arp, like m proteins, may be a streptococcal virulence factor.

TI  == the streptokinase gene of group a streptococci: cloning, expression in escherichia coli, and sequence analysis.
AB  == the gene specifying the group a streptokinase (ska) gene was cloned from an m type 49 strain of streptococcus pyogenes and shown to express in escherichia coli. the nucleotide sequence of the dna fragment carrying ska was determined and compared to that of the group c streptokinase gene (skc). there is 90% sequence identity between the two genes, with highly conserved transcription and translation control regions. the deduced amino acid sequence of the group a streptokinase (ska) contains the same number of amino acids as that of group c streptokinase, with 85% sequence identity between the two proteins. among 440 amino acid residues specified by the coding sequence, there are 62 non-identical  residues with 45 conserved and 17 non-conserved residues. the non-identical residues are located in two major regions, spanning residues 174 to 244 and 270 to 290, with 40 and 10 amino acid changes, respectively. the sequence differences provide an explanation at the molecular level for the previous findings of immunological and chemical heterogeneity among streptokinase produced by pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == sequence analysis and expression in escherichia coli of the hyaluronidase gene of streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage h4489a.
AB  == the hyaluronidase gene (hylp) from streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage h4489a was previously cloned into escherichia coli plasmid puc8 as a 3.1-kilobase thai fragment. southern hybridization experiments confirmed the origin of this fragment in bacteriophage h4489a before determination of the nucleotide sequence  of the entire fragment. two open reading frames (orfs) were found, the first of which specified a 39,515-molecular-weight protein identified as the bacteriophage hyaluronidase. the second orf encoded a 65,159-molecular-weight protein of unknown function. putative transcription and translation control sequences for each orf were identified by using a plasmid containing a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. controlled exclusive expression of the hylp gene via the t7 polymerase-promoter system in e. coli resulted in a 40,000-dalton protein, a result consistent with the coding capacity of the hylp gene.

TI  == sensitivity patterns of bacteria isolated from patients at sidamo regional hospital.
AB  == this study from the sidamo regional hospital presents the prevailing sensitivity  to common antimicrobials among 337 bacterial isolates from abscesses, infected wounds, urine or gonorrhoeal infections. as expected, staphylococcus aureus escherichia cloi, proteus supp and streptococcus pyogenes were most frequently grown from abscesses and infected wounds, whereas e. coli, proteus spp, klebsiella spp, and coagulase negative staphylococci dominated in urinary tract infections. very high rates of reduced sensitivity, including multiresistance to  commonly used antibiotics, were detected. of 54 isolates of niesseria gonorrhoeae 84% were resistant to penicillin-g by disc diffusion method. beta lactamase production was detected in 4 of 6 isolates tested.

TI  == [bactericidal activity of enoxacin and ciprofloxacin in body fluids].
AB  == until present studies are lacking which investigate the bactericidal activity of  new quinolones in body fluids. therefore, we determined bactericidal titers of enoxacin (en) and ciprofloxacin (cip) against a typical pathogen in urinary tract infections (escherichia coli) in urine and against a typical pathogen in respiratory tract infections (streptococcus pyogenes) in sputum, in each case at  the time of peak and trough levels (in vitro data of the test strains: e. coli -  micen = 0.06 mg/l, miccip = 0.06 mg/l, mbcen = 0.5 mg/l, mbccip = 0.25 mg/l; streptococcus pyogenes - micen = 32 mg/l, miccip = 1 mg/l, mbcen greater than 64  mg/l, mbccip greater than 64 mg/l). following a randomization list, ten healthy volunteers took either 400 mg enoxacin b.i.d. for three days, then (after a break of at least three days) 500 mg ciprofloxacin b.i.d. for three days, or vice versa. two and 12 hours after the final dose, samples of sputum were taken, urine was collected 2-4 h and 10-12 h after the final dose. the bactericidal titers against e. coli in urine were greater than 1:512 (2-4 h after the final dose) and greater than 1:64 (10-12 h after the final dose) for both quinolones in all cases. on the other hand, as to s. pyogenes were found growth in every dilution of sputum. these results confirm the scepticism against quinolone therapy of respiratory tract infections caused by streptococci.

TI  == [clinical studies on sultamicillin fine granule in pediatric field].
AB  == pharmacokinetics, safety and effects on bacterial infection of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granule were evaluated in 17 children. the results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. pharmacokinetics in 3 children receiving a single dose  of 10 mg per kg body weight were evaluated. the half-life of ampicillin (abpc) was 1.38 +/- 0.14 hours and that of sulbactam was 0.93 +/- 0.26 hour. 2. fourteen cases, including 7 tonsillitis, 2 pharyngitis, 2 bronchitis, and 1 each of cystitis, scarlet fever and cellulitis were treated with sbtpc fine granule. the  clinical efficacy rate was 100%. 3. bacteriological efficacies classified by causative organisms were evaluated in 5 children. staphylococcus aureus was responsible in 3 cases, streptococcus pyogenes in 1 case, escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis in 1 case. eradication rate was 100%. sbtpc was more active than abpc against abpc-resistant strains and almost equal to or more active than  cephalexin or cefaclor. 4. the only abnormal laboratory test value observed was eosinophilia in 2 children. no side effects were recorded. from the above results it is concluded that sbtpc fine granule is one of first choices of effective, useful and safe antibiotics for the treatment of infections in pediatric field.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

TI  == increased kasugamycin sensitivity in escherichia coli caused by the presence of an inducible erythromycin resistance (erm) gene of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == an inducible erythromycin resistance gene (erm) of streptococcus pyogenes was introduced into escherichia coli by transformation with a plasmid. the recipient  e. coli cells were either kasugamycin sensitive (wildtype) or kasugamycin resistant (ksga). the mic values of erythromycin increased from 150 micrograms/ml to greater than 3000 micrograms/ml for e. coli. an extract of transformed cells,  particularly a high-salt ribosomal wash, contained an enzyme that was able to methylate 23s rrna from untransformed cells in vitro; however, 23s rrna from transformed cells was not a substrate for methylation by such an extract. 165 rrna and 30s ribosomal subunits of either the wild type or a kasugamycin resistant (ksga) mutant were not methylated in vitro. transformation of e. coli by the erm-containing plasmid led to a reduction of the mic values for kasugamycin. this happened in wild-type as well as in ksga cells. however, in vitro experiments with purified ksga encoded methylase demonstrated that also in  erm transformed e. coli, the ksga encoded enzyme was active in wild-type, but not in ksga cells. it was also shown by in vitro experiments that ribosomes from erm  ksga cells have become sensitive to kasugamycin. our experiments show that in vivo methylation of 23s rrna, presumably of the adenosine at position 2058, leads to enhanced resistance to erythromycin and to reduced resistance to kasugamycin.  this, together with previous data, argues for a close proximity of the two sites  on the ribosome that are substrates for adenosine dimethylation.

TI  == pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of bacteroides fragilis and  b. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with escherichia coli and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate bacteroides fragilis strains and escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of  the b. melaninogenicus group and streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (s. pyogenes, e. coli or bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. however, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. non-capsulate bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either s. pyogenes or e. coli. therapy directed  at the elimination of s. pyogenes and e. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate bacteroides spp. these data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the b. fragilis group and e. coli and between the b. melaninogenicus group and s. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.

TI  == human monoclonal antibodies reactive with antigens of the group a streptococcus and human heart.
AB  == human mab were produced from tonsillar or pbl of normal individuals or patients infected with group a streptococci. lymphocytes were purified on ficoll-hypaque gradients and stimulated in vitro with purified group a streptococcal membranes or m protein extracts. the mab were selected for study based on their reaction with group a streptococci, pep m5 protein, and/or m6 escherichia coli protein. further analysis by western immunoblot or competitive inhibition elisa revealed that there were two types of antibodies: one type that reacted with myosin and dna and the other type that reacted with myosin, keratin, and/or actin. the specificities of these human mab are similar to specificities observed in our previous studies of murine mab reactive with group a streptococci and heart ag. for comparison, anti-myosin antibodies were affinity purified from the sera of infected or acute rheumatic fever patients and were shown to react with myosin and dna as well as with group a streptococci and m protein. to affinity purify these antibodies from normal sera, five times the amount of sera was required to  obtain detectable quantities. these data suggest that the human mab reactive with group a streptococci and myosin reflect the antibodies seen in sera from infected patients or acute rheumatics and that the b lymphocyte clones capable of producing these cross-reactive antibodies are also present in normal individuals.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  == to interpret of the cefoperazone (cpz) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in japan, but a 3 category system is used in the u.s.a. and europe. in the 4 category interpretation system of showa cpz disc the following classification is used: ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. in the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible mic less than  or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible mic less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible mic greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant mic greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. reliability of the cpz disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate mics by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and  75 micrograms. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. a good negative correlation was observed between  inhibitory zone diameters and mics, showing reliability of the test using these discs. the results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of cpz were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. some strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. when different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for p. aeruginosa, and e. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. with 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which mics of cpz were below 3 micrograms/ml. however, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which mics were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. the fact that most frequent values of mics of cpz against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp., haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. according to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis and flare-up reaction in mice induced by homologous or heterologous cell walls.
AB  == intra-articular injection of cell walls from the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes induces an arthritis in both streptococcal cell wall (scw)-primed and naive mice. this joint inflammation subsides after 2 weeks but it could be reactivated by systemic injection of scw in a dose-dependent way. the primary arthritis as well as the flare-up reaction were more vehement in immunized than naive mice. pretreatment with antilymphocyte serum of nonimmunized arthritic mice before systemic challenge completely inhibits the flare-up reaction, suggesting the involvement of lymphocytes in the reactivation. dose-response studies showed that intravenous challenge with scw amounts too small to induce a primary arthritis were able to reactivate a chronic arthritis,  implying that an inflamed joint is in a hyperreactive state, probably due to locally retained lymphocytes. arthritis as a result of injection with scw can be  reactivated by fragments of a nonrelated, gram negative endogenous bacterium, escherichia coli. the latter finding might be of importance for the understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic arthritis: once an arthritis is induced by one bacterium, other (unrelated) bacteria, probably derived from an endogenous source, may be able to reactivate the inflammatory process, thus contributing to  chronicity.

TI  == many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence galnac beta 1-4gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  == pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the united states. to examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. the classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such  as streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-gm1 (fuc alpha 1-2gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4cer), asialo-gm1 (gal beta 1-3galnac beta 1-4gal beta-1-4galc beta 1-1cer), and asialo-gm2 (galnac beta 1-4gal beta 1-4glc beta 1-1cer). bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. they do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides gm1, gm2, gm3, gd1a, gd1b, gt1b, and cad. the finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked galnac, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-gm1 and asialo-gm1 and terminally in asialo-gm2, is required for binding. beta-n-acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence galnac beta 1-3gal. these data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal galnac beta 1-4gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. other bacteria,  including mycoplasma pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella species, and  some e. coli, do not bind to the galnac beta 1-4gal sequence. the biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-gm1 occur in human lung tissue.

AB  == the 1479-base pair (bp) nucleotide sequence of the serotype 5 m protein gene (smp5) from streptococcus pyogenes contains three distinct types of tandemly repeated sequences, designated a, b, and c. repeat a (21 bp x 6, in the 5'-half of smp5), shares no homology with the types 6 or 24 m protein genes (hollingshead, s. k., fischetti, v. a., and scott, j. r. (1986) j. biol. chem. 261, 1677-1686; mouw, a. r., beachey, e. h., and burdett, v. (1988) j. bacteriol., in press). repeat b (75 bp x 3.6, in the center of smp5) is also present in the m6, but not in the m24 gene. repeat c (105 bp x 2.7, just distal to the b repeats) shares homology with repeats in both the m6 and m24 genes. all  three genes share extensive homology in their 3'-halves and in 5' sequences encoding the n-terminal signal peptides, but between these two regions there are  highly variable sequences that are responsible for antigenic diversity. these relationships suggest that both intergenic and intragenic recombination has occurred during the evolution of distinct m protein serotypes. all three m proteins contain conserved hydrophobic and proline-rich sequences at their c-terminal ends, suggestive of a membrane anchor and a peptidoglycan spanning region.

TI  == reaction of bacterium-primed murine t cells to cartilage components: a clue for the pathogenesis of arthritis?
AB  == although different models for rheumatoid arthritis have been studied, the pathogenesis in humans remains unknown. a possible mechanism is the crossreactivity between bacterial components and the target-tissue, the cartilage. the existence of this crossreactivity is supported by various data from clinical and experimental studies. here we provide direct evidence that priming in vivo with cell wall fragments of streptococcus pyogenes or escherichia coli can induce a cellular and humoral anti-cartilage response in balb/c mice in  vitro. t cells isolated from these mice can be stimulated in vitro to proliferate by a variety of antigens among which are the priming bacterium, an unrelated bacterium, small bacterial components and diverse antigens of cartilagenous origin. in bacterium-primed mice antibodies were also detected that displayed a reactivity to cartilage extract besides the reactivity to bacteria. a crossreactive response occurred in vivo in certain circumstances: a delayed type  hypersensitivity reaction could be elicited in cell-wall-primed mice by challenge with cartilage extract. for the expression of this crossreactive response in vivo however, it was obligatory to attenuate the mouse's suppressor-circuit. in this paper we would suggest a mechanism for the pathology of chronic arthritis, based  on repeated challenges with different bacterial stimuli.

TI  == host-vector system for integration of recombinant dna into chromosomes of transformable and nontransformable streptococci.
AB  == we describe a genetic system in which transformation of streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant dna into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetm) 6001 (omega 6001). the element containing the recombinant dna was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. when escherichia coli plasmid pdp36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous dna into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous dna caused inactivation of the tetm gene of omega 6001. by analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous dna was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. it was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of s. pneumoniae, s. sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus faecalis. the omega 6001-pdp36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in  streptococci. by this method cloned streptococcal dna (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of peptides from xenopus granular gland secretions.
AB  == previously, we described a family of novel broad spectrum antimicrobial peptides, magainins, from the skin of xenopus laevis. in this report we show that at least  two other xenopus peptides, present in the skin and its secretions, pgla and a peptide released from the xenopsin precursor, exhibit antimicrobial properties comparable to the magainins. the identification of these newer members provides insight into the structural diversity of vertebrate antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == molecular evolution of streptococcal m protein: cloning and nucleotide sequence of the type 24 m protein gene and relation to other genes of streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the structural gene for the type 24 m protein of group a streptococci has been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene and the 3' and 5' flanking regions was determined. the sequence includes an  open reading frame of 1,617 base pairs encoding a pre-m24 protein of 539 amino acids and a predicted mr of 58,738. the structural gene contains two distinct tandemly reiterated elements. the first repeated element consists of 5.3 units, and the second contains 2.7 units. each element shows little variation of the basic 35-amino-acid unit. comparison of the sequence of the m24 protein with the  sequence of the m6 protein (s. k. hollingshead, v. a. fischetti, and j. r. scott, j. biol. chem. 261:1677-1686, 1986) indicates that these molecules have are conserved except in the regions coding for the antigenic (type specific) determinant and they have three regions of homology within the structural genes:  38 of 42 amino acids within the amino terminal signal sequence, the second repeated element of the m24 protein is found in the m6 molecule at the same position in the protein, and the carboxy terminal 164 amino acids, including a membrane anchor sequence, are conserved in both proteins. in addition, the sequences flanking the two genes are strongly conserved.

TI  == in vivo postantibiotic effect in a thigh infection in neutropenic mice.
AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. we demonstrated and standardized the in vivo pae in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant paes. against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced paes of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce paes against streptococci. with few exceptions the in vivo pae correlated well with the pae reported in prior in vitro studies. residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the pae. theoretically, the presence of a pae may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bmy-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. the bmy-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by bmy-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: citrobacter diversus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus supp., streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. bovis, serogroup c and g streptococci, listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. bmy-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. bmy-28100 was generally bactericidal, but mics for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) cfu/ml was used. strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (tem, oxa, shv, hms) were susceptible to bmy-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. bmy-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (types i and iv). bmy-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but  was destroyed by type i cephalosporinases and klebsiella k1 enzymes.

TI  == correlation of in vitro activities of the fluoroquinolones to their in vivo efficacies.
AB  == the new fluoroquinolones have activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in order to differentiate between the compounds, the authors have compared their in vitro activities and correlated these results with their in vivo efficacies. norfloxacin (n), pefloxacin (p), enoxacin (e), ofloxacin (o), difloxacin (d), ciprofloxacin (c), fleroxacin (f), a-61827 (a), temafloxacin (t)  and lomefloxacin (l) were used in these studies. in vitro, c was the most active  compound against gram-negative aerobic bacteria and a was the most active compound against gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. in mouse protection  tests, c, d, a, o, t and f had similar activities against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d, t and a were the most active quinolones against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes and strep. pneumoniae in mouse protection tests. d was the most active agent against intracellular infection with salmonella typhimurium, followed by o, t, a and f. the other compounds were  ineffective in this test. all the quinolones were effective in treating e. coli pyelonephritis in mice. the doses required to treat p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis  in mice were four times greater than those required to treat e. coli. resistant p. aeruginosa mutants could be isolated from the kidneys after quinolone treatment. systemic infections with e. coli, staph. aureus and p. aeruginosa in neutropenic mice required high doses of the fluoroquinolones and f, t and a were  ineffective at doses of 100 mg/kg against p. aeruginosa in this model. differences in in vitro potencies were not reflected in in vivo efficacies.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

TI  == effect of prophylactic antibiotics upon mixed infections with bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations to explore the effect of  prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. subcutaneous abscesses in mice were induced by single and mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococci and escherichia coli. the infected mice were treated with three doses of gentamicin, cefoxitin, metronidazole or clindamycin alone or else  metronidazole or clindamycin in combination with gentamicin. mice were sacrificed five days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses were determined. infection induced by a single bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. however, in infections caused by two organisms, therapy directed at either the bacteroides fragilis (with metronidazole or clindamycin) or escherichia coli (with gentamicin) was effective in not only significantly reducing the colony forming units (cfu) of the target organism but also reducing the number of untreated bacteria. clindamycin alone was effective in reducing the cfu of both components of mixed infections of bacteroides fragilis with either staphylococcus aureus or group a streptococci. cefoxitin alone and the combination of either clindamycin or metronidazole with gentamicin were effective against all mixed infections. these data support the need to provide coverage for all components of mixed infections with single or combination therapy.

TI  == identification of a gene that regulates expression of m protein, the major virulence determinant of group a streptococci.
AB  == by using tn916 insertional mutagenesis, we have identified mry (m protein rna yield), a gene required for high-level expression of the m protein, an essential  virulence determinant of the group a streptococcus. the mry::tn916 mutation causes a reduction by a factor of approximately equal to 50 in the amount of m protein produced, in the original strain and in a nonmutagenized host to which the mutation was transferred by transduction. the insertion is located approximately 1.8 kilobases upstream of the structural gene for m protein (emm) and its promoter. the genomic region including mry::tn916 and emm was cloned on a cosmid vector and introduced into escherichia coli. when the transposon excised precisely from the chimeric cosmid in e. coli, the resulting streptococcal dna showed the same restriction pattern as the homologous chromosomal region in the parental nonmutagenized streptococcus. the sequence of the promoter for emm was not altered in the mry mutant. the reduction in protein correlates with a decrease in the amount of m protein-specific mrna, indicating that mry regulates  transcription of emm.

AB  == the composition and opsonizing activity of five commercially available immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous use (venoglobulin i, venilon, gammagard, polyglobin, and sandoglobulin) were studied. the composition of these  preparations does not differ very much as far as total protein, immunoglobulin class and igg subclass concentrations are concerned. the only exceptions were that veniglobulin i, gammagard and sandoglobulin contain iga, which might cause side effects in patients with anti-iga antibodies, gammagard contains very little igg4, and venilon and polyglobin contain no and almost no igg3, respectively, which might explain their very low opsonic activity. it was found that venilon and gammagard activate complement in the ready-for-infusion state. the opsonic activity of venoglobulin i, sandoglobulin and gammagard is about equal to that of inactivated serum: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli with k antigen, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus group b are well opsonized and e. coli without k antigen and streptococcus pneumoniae are poorly opsonized.

TI  == dynamics of the acute uterine response to infection, endotoxin infusion and physical manipulation of the reproductive tract in the mare.
AB  == the uterine responses after the infusion of saline (pbs), a bacterial suspension, or lipopolysaccharide derived from escherichia coli, and after stimulation of the reproductive tract were compared. all infusions provoked a response involving both serum proteins and leucocytes. protein levels peaked within a few hours of infusion, whereas leucocyte concentration peaked later at around 6 h. bacterial recovery from the uterus followed a similar pattern, with recovery falling dramatically by 12 h. in mares known to be susceptible to infection large numbers of bacteria were again recovered after 24 h. no differences were apparent between resistant and susceptible mares in protein or leucocyte concentrations. stimulation of the cervix and uterus resulted in a protein and neutrophil response. in contrast, vaginal stimulation failed to provoke the uterine defences.

TI  == effect of immunostimulants and antitumor agents on tumor necrosis factor (tnf) production.
AB  == ok-432, a lyophilized preparation of streptococcus pyogenes, showed a priming activity for tnf production in mice, associated with an increase of spleen weight. psk, a protein-bound polysaccharide preparation from coriolus versicolor, did not show such activity. both ok-432 and psk potentiated the tnf production in mice primed with corynebacterium parvum (cp) and challenged with escherichia coli endotoxin (lps). cytotoxic antitumor agents of 5-fluorouracil (5-fu), cyclophosphamide (cy) and bleomycin (blm) suppressed tnf production in mice primed with cp and challenged with lps. tnf production suppressed by 5-fu, cy and blm was partially restored by the combined treatment with ok-432 or psk. these results suggest that the administration of cytotoxic antitumor agents suppresses  the intrinsic tnf production in cancer patients, and the combined use of immunostimulants such as ok-432 and psk is advantageous in restoring tnf production suppressed by cytotoxic antitumor agents.

AB  == a retrospective survey over a 66-month period of children admitted with head injury who subsequently developed meningitis within the same period yielded six cases (five boys, one girl), giving an incidence of 0.38 per cent. two of the six died, and four survived with no sequelae. four cases occurred within the first week. one patient, who had received prophylactic antibiotics, developed escherichia coli meningitis after 14 days and one had meningitis 2 years after the head injury. the most common organism was pneumococcus (four cases). three patients had periorbital haematomas and none had cerebrospinal fluid leakage. increasing drowsiness and fever were the most consistent features. radiography of the skull was of little use in demonstrating fracture of the base of the skull. two of the four surviving patients had craniotomy with successful dural repair.

TI  == sequence homology of group a streptococcal pep m5 protein with other coiled-coil  proteins.
AB  == group a streptococcal pep m5 protein, an antiphagocytic determinant of the bacteria, is an alpha-helical coiled-coil molecule, and exhibits significant sequence homology with tropomyosin and myosin, but to a lesser degree with other  coiled-coil proteins. moreover, pep m5 is more homologous to myosin than to tropomyosin, and the homologies are more numerous between the c-terminal domain of the pep m5 protein and the s2 fragment of myosin. the c-terminal domain of the pep m5 protein exhibits extensive sequence identity with the c-terminal region of pep m6 molecule, another m protein serotype. thus, regions within two m protein serotypes are homologous to the s2 region of the myosin molecule. these observations are consistent with the immunological findings of other investigators and thus may explain some of the previously reported immunological  cross-reactions between antigens of the group a streptococcus and mammalian heart tissue.

TI  == enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for adherence of bacteria to animal cells.
AB  == epithelial cells scraped from human oral mucosa and from pig intestines were immobilized onto the flat bottom surfaces of microtiter plates to study the adherence of various bacterial species to host cells. bacterial adherence was quantitated either by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique with specific antibacterial serum as the first antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated second antibody or by using biotinylated bacteria and avidin-peroxidase as the detecting agent. unlabeled escherichia coli and purified e. coli 987p fimbriae inhibited the adherence of biotinylated e. coli to immobilized enterocytes. the adherence of a mannose-sensitive strain of e. coli to immobilized oral epithelial cells was inhibited by mannose derivatives. the adherence of fimbriated e. coli 987p to immobilized enterocytes was approximately four times higher than the adherence of a nonfimbriated variant of the same strain. the adherence of streptococcus pyogenes to oral cells was detected in the range of 10 to 150 bacteria per cell and was inhibited by lipoteichoic acid and albumin. the data suggest that the putative receptors which bind bacteria on the  immobilized cells retain a functional form similar to that of native cells in suspension. the proposed adherence assay is easy to perform, allows the detection of specific adherence of test bacteria, and provides objective quantitation of adherence with a sensitivity of 10 bacteria per cell. most importantly, the assay allows the testing of many variables in the same day.

AB  == the dna sequence of the gene for type 6 m protein of streptococcus pyogenes contains two extended tandem repeat regions and one nontandem repeat region. we suggest that the duplication and deletion of these repeats generates the observed diversity in size and sequence among the family of m proteins in the group a streptococci. in addition, the dna sequence reveals the presence of a 42-amino-acid signal peptide, a region rich in proline that is thought to be located in the cell wall, and a membrane anchor sequence at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. signals similar to the consensus sequences recognized for the initiation of transcription and translation in gram-positive bacteria have been identified in the dna sequence. codon usage is similar to that of other gram-positive bacteria and significantly different from that of escherichia coli.

AB  == a-56619 and a-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a-56619 and a-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. infection with salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with a-56619 (50% effective dose [ed50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ed50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). e. coli or pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with a-56619 or a-56620 than with norfloxacin. after oral treatment, the  ed50s of a-56619 and a-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against e. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against e. coli or p. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. a-56619 and a-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by e. coli and streptococcus faecalis. a-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and a-56620  was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against klebsiella pneumonia in mice. a-56619 and a-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. a-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas a-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. the peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of a-56619 and a-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. the serum hal-lives of a-56619 and a-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.

TI  == current state and tendencies of antibiotic resistance in hungary.
AB  == this survey is based on data for 245 903 isolates reported by public health network laboratories in 1983. facultatively pathogenic gram-negative bacteria comprised two-third of the isolates, and--except escherichia coli--were resistant in a high percent to the most frequently used antibiotics. oxacillin and vancomycin were the most effective against staphylococcus aureus being in 94.7% resistant to penicillin. in contrast to other streptococci, all streptococcus pyogenes strains were sensitive to penicillin. the majority of the gram-positive  strains were resistant to tetracycline. a comparison to results reported earlier  (1974 to 1983) showed an increasing resistance rate mainly to ampicillin, carbenicillin, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin, which were introduced in therapy during this period. resistance rate of almost all species has increased to gentamicin, e.g. that of proteus mirabilis has risen tenfold. emergence of haemophilus influenzae resistant to ampicillin, and increasing resistance rates of p. mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae to almost all drugs are remarkable findings. the increasing or variable usage of drugs that have been used for a long time did not influence resistance markedly. in some instances the resistance rates even diminished, e.g. the tetracycline resistance of agents associated with enteric diseases. a restricted use of chloramphenicol reflected in a decreased resistance of some species. multiresistant gram-negative strains--which are resistant to all drugs frequently used in hungary--were isolated in 12.7% from a  representative clinical material. the frequent occurrence of multiresistant p. mirabilis and acinetobacter isolates is a new phenomenon. surprisingly, the percentage of multiresistant e. coli strains was very low. amikacin and netilmicin were found to be the most effective against multiresistant isolates.

AB  == imipenem is the first of a new class of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents with potent in vitro activity against most bacterial pathogens that cause infections in children. we studied, prospectively, the clinical efficacy and toxicity of imipenem/cilastatin in 40 children with proved or suspected bacterial infection.  a dose of 100 mg/kg/day of imipenem was given to children younger than 3 years of age, while children older than 3 years of age received 60 mg/kg/day. twenty-nine  organisms were isolated from 26 patients. infections treated included cellulitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, lymphadenitis, renal infections, wound infections, and pneumonia. bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. all patients responded favorably to treatment, with defervescence and improvement of  symptoms. all of the infecting bacteria were susceptible to imipenem. imipenem/cilastatin was well tolerated, with no serious side effects, and appeared to be an effective and safe antimicrobial agent in the treatment of the  population studied.

TI  == impaired bacterial degradation by monocytes and macrophages from a patient with treated whipple's disease.
AB  == a patient with whipple's disease is described, and multiparameter flow cytometric examinations of several of the patient's phagocyte functions 3 and 9 mo after the start of oxytetracycline therapy are reported. almost no intracellular degradation of escherichia coli or streptococcus pyogenes proteins and dna occurred after ingestion by the patient's monocytes and macrophages. in addition, only minor digestion of phagocytized zymosan particles was detected. the mononuclear intracellular degradation was equally impaired 3 and 9 mo after the start of therapy. the monocyte and macrophage phagocytosis and intracellular killing, and all granulocyte phagocyte functions tested, were normal. the impaired mononuclear degradation of ingested material that was measured is consistent with the accumulation of periodic acid-schiff-positive bacterial degradation products seen in macrophages of affected tissues in vivo, and suggests a key role of macrophage dysfunction in the pathogenesis of whipple's disease.

TI  == detection of a unique human v kappa iv germline gene by a cloned cdna probe.
AB  == we have cloned the cdna encoding the kiv chain of a human antibody with specificity against the major carbohydrate antigen of streptococcus a. the cdna has been used as a genetic probe to estimate the number of germline vkiv genes in human dna. the presence of unique hybridizing bands on digestion of human dna with several restriction endonucleases and the equivalence of the dna in a band to a single gene per haploid genome point to the conclusion that there is a unique human vkiv germline gene. the corollary of this conclusion is that the diversity of human vkiv chains must be exclusively due to somatic mutation. this  is supported by examination of the sequences of human kiv chain genes and their kiv chain products. fusion of the unique germline vkiv gene (1) with one of several jk segments, followed by somatic mutations in the v region of the rearranged kiv gene, can account for the known sequences. the restricted germline gene repertoire may account for the small proportion of human kiv chains in the human k chain sequence library (2).

TI  == immunoglobulin a subclass distribution of naturally occurring salivary antibodies to microbial antigens.
AB  == the distribution of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) and iga2 antibodies to various microbial antigens was determined in human parotid saliva by using monoclonal antibodies to the iga subclasses in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. in 12 subjects examined, antibodies to streptococcus mutans glucosyl transferase, protein antigen i/ii, and cell wall carbohydrate, as well as dextrans b1355 fraction s and b512 and phosphorylcholine, occurred predominantly in the iga1 subclass. in contrast, antibodies to lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus pyogenes and whole lipopolysaccharides from bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli were predominantly of the iga2 subclass. the data  indicate that in most individuals naturally occurring antibodies to a given antigen are predominantly associated with one of the two subclasses of iga.

TI  == evolution and epidemiology of mls resistance.
AB  == within the framework of this symposium, it is not feasible to present an exhaustive description of the present state of knowledge regarding the sensitivity and resistance of bacterial species to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins (mls). this paper is limited to a description of the evolution of  different types of resistance in the light of decisive factors described in previous papers, in order to deduce, if at all possible, trends in future strategy in therapeutics. only acquired resistance lends itself to epidemiological study, in contrast to natural resistance which is, by definition, characteristic of a species or a genus, and not liable to change. three groups will therefore be studied in turn: staphylococcus aureus, streptococci and bacteroides fragilis. there is as yet insufficient accumulated data to draw conclusions regarding the epidemiology and evolution of mlsb resistance observed  in clostridium perfringens and corynebacterium diphtheriae, or regarding the high-level resistance to erythromycin due to enzymatic inactivation recently described in escherichia coli.

TI  == deposition of c3b and ic3b onto particulate activators of the human complement system. quantitation with monoclonal antibodies to human c3.
AB  == monoclonal antibodies were used to determine the number and molecular form of c3  bound to particulate activators of the complement (c) system by human serum. sheep erythrocytes (e) coated with igm (eigm) and igg (eigg) were used to study activation of the classical pathway (cp). yeast (y), rabbit erythrocytes (er), and five species of bacteria (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae type 3, streptococcus pyogenes, and hemophilus influenzae type b) were used to study activation of the alternative pathway (ap). the deposition of c3b onto eigm and eigg incubated in c7-deficient human serum was dependent on the serum concentration. at all serum concentrations tested, there was complete conversion of c3b to ic3b. kinetic analysis of c3b deposition  and conversion to ic3b indicated that these events occurred almost simultaneously; the reaction was completed by 15 min. the deposition of c3 onto the ap activators er and y was also dependent on serum concentration, and er, but not y, required the presence of mg-egta and thus the activation of only the ap. c3b deposition and conversion to ic3b on y was complete in 15 min, with 82% of bound c3 converted to ic3b. for er, maximum c3 deposition required 30 min in both the presence and absence of mg-egta. however, after 1 h of incubation, 74% of bound c2 was ic3b in the absence of mg-egta, compared with only 52% in the presence of mg-egta. thus, even on ap activators, a large portion of c3b may be converted to ic3b, and this conversion is probably controlled by elements on the  particle's surface. studies with the five species of bacteria yielded similar results. approximately 3-5 x 10(4) molecules of c3 were bound per microorganism,  with opsonization being completed in 30 min. remarkably, only 16-28% of bound c3  was in the form of ic3b, even after 2 h of incubation. the presence or absence of mg-egta, or the addition of purified cr1 to the reaction mixture, did not significantly effect the ratio of c3b to ic3b. finally, sds-page and autoradiography of particle-bound 125i-c3 fragments confirmed that there was no conversion of ic3b to c3d,g or c3d. the data obtained about the opsonization of bacteria suggest that the predominant form of c3 that is encountered by inflammatory phagocytes may be c3b.

TI  == role of fibronectin in attachment of streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli  to human cell lines and isolated oral epithelial cells.
AB  == we studied the binding of cells of streptococcus pyogenes and mannose-sensitive escherichia coli to human fibroblast cell lines and isolated buccal epithelial cells in relation to the cell-associated endogenous or exogenous fibronectin of the host cells. the degree of bacterial binding to cell lines correlated directly with the content of endogenous fibronectin on the surface of the cultured cells,  although the correlation was better with s. pyogenes than with e. coli. the addition of exogenous plasma fibronectin to the cell lines or oral epithelial cells enhanced binding of s. pyogenes but suppressed binding of mannose-sensitive e. coli. these findings are consistent with the notion that exogenously acquired  fibronectin on the surface of host cells modulates bacterial adherence by providing attachment sites for certain pathogens, such as s. pyogenes, and by blocking receptors for others, such as mannose-sensitive e. coli.

AB  == the immunochemical properties of type 5 m protein antigens that were expressed in escherichia coli k-12 by recombinant lambda bacteriophages isolated from a gene bank of serotype 5 streptococcus pyogenes have been analyzed in detail. m proteins from partially purified bacteriophage lysates displayed precipitin lines of identity with a purified peptic extract of type 5 m protein (pep m5) in immunodiffusion assays. immunoblot analyses of the m protein-positive lysates demonstrated that the cloned m protein component resided in five polypeptides with relative molecular weights of 57,900 (57.9k), 55.4k, 52.9k, 40.0k, and 32.6k. the hybrid lambda phage (lambda m5)-produced m protein contained immunoprotective epitopes; lambda m5 protein inhibited opsonization of type 5 streptococci by pep m5 antibodies, and antiserum raised against lambda m5 lysates opsonized type 5 streptococci. each of the five antigenic polypeptides of the recombinant phage m protein also shared epitopes with human heart tissue, as demonstrated by the reactivity of immunoblots of lambda m5 antigens separated on  sodium dodecyl sulfate gels with anti-pep m5 antibodies absorbed to and eluted from human heart sarcolemmal membranes. moreover, antiserum raised against the lambda m5 lysates reacted with sarcolemmal membrane proteins with relative molecular weights of 200k, 59k, 55k, 53k, and 27k as determined by immunoblot analyses. these results demonstrate that the structural gene coding for type 5 streptococcal m protein which was inserted into lambda dna expresses immunoprotective epitopes, some of which are shared with human heart tissue.

AB  == serum amyloid p component (sap), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-o-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-d-galactopyranoside (mo beta dg) [hind, collins, renn, cook, caspi, baltz & pepys (1984) j. exp. med. 159, 1058-1069]. sap was found to bind in vitro to klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is  known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. sap also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group a streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. no sap bound to escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. binding of sap to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free mo beta dg. sap, a human plasma  protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == new orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella, enterobacter, proteus mirabilis, proteus sp. indole-positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. none of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against bacteroides fragilis. ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or  ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though  the difference was less marked. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against s. aureus. results with agar and with broth were comparable. the activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the mic values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). the new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.

TI  == bordetella adenylate cyclase: host toxicity and diagnostic utility.
AB  == two toxins from bordetella pertussis, pertussis toxin and bordetella adenylate cyclase, cause profound disruptions of camp metabolism in mammalian cells. while  the role of each toxin in the whooping cough syndrome is unknown, it is highly likely that together they confer on the organism an important proliferative advantage. intact b. pertussis cells express large amounts of adenylate cyclase activity on their exterior surface. in a presently unknown fashion, this enzyme can enter human phagocytes, elevate cellular camp and impair host defense. we reasoned that this unusual enzyme might serve to signal the presence of b. pertussis in nasopharyngeal swabs from infected persons. here we report a series  of in vitro experiments which confirm the feasibility of such an approach. we find that calcium alginate swabs containing as few as 100 b. pertussis organisms  produce readily detectable amounts of camp in our assay. nasopharyngeal secretions swabbed from healthy volunteers, however produced no detectable camp alone and did not affect the production of camp by b. pertussis. we have also tested pure cultures of four common bacterial pathogens (haemophilus influenzae,  streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli) which may be co-isolated in clinical whooping cough and find that none interferes with the detection of b. pertussis. we conclude that the unique adenylate cyclase of b. pertussis might be a valuable diagnostic device.

TI  == the gene for type a streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) is located in bacteriophage t12.
AB  == the infection of streptococcus pyogenes t25(3) with the temperate bacteriophage t12 results in the conversion of the nontoxigenic strain to type a streptococcal  exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) production. although previous research has established that integration of the bacteriophage genome into the host chromosome is not essential for exotoxin production, the location of the gene on the bacteriophage or bacterial chromosome had not been determined. in the present investigation, recombinant dna techniques were used to determine whether the gene specifying type a streptococcal exotoxin (spea) production is located on the bacteriophage chromosome. bacteriophage t12 was obtained from s. pyogenes t25(3)(t12) by induction with mitomycin c, and after isolation of bacteriophage dna by phenol-chloroform extraction, the dna was digested with restriction enzymes and ligated with escherichia coli plasmid php34 or the streptococcus-e. coli shuttle vector psa3. transformation of e. coli hb101 with the recombinant molecules allowed selection of e. coli clones containing bacteriophage t12 genes. immunological assays with specific antibody revealed the presence of type a streptococcal exotoxin in sonicates of e. coli transformants. subcloning experiments localized the spea gene to a 1.7-kilobase segment of the bacteriophage t12 genome flanked by sali and hindiii sites. introduction of the psa3 vector containing the spea gene into streptococcus sanguis (challis) resulted in transformants that secreted the type a exotoxin. immunological analysis showed that the type a streptococcal exotoxin produced by e. coli and s. sanguis transformants was identical to the type a exotoxin produced by s. pyogenes t25(3)(t12). southern blot hybridizations with the cloned fragment confirmed its presence in the bacteriophage t12 genome and its absence in the t25(3) nonlysogen. therefore, the gene for type a streptococcal exotoxin is located in the bacteriophage genome, and conversion of s. pyogenes t25(3) to toxigenicity occurs in a manner similar to the conversion of corynebacterium diphtheriae to toxigenicity by bacteriophage beta.

TI  == characteristics and functional capacities of human cord blood granulocytes and monocytes.
AB  == cord blood phagocytic cells were characterized with respect to cytochemical activities, fc gamma and c3b receptors, and capacity to phagocytose and kill various species of bacteria. the percentages of peroxidase-positive granulocytes  and monocytes from neonates and adults were comparable; the percentage of esterase-positive cord-blood monocytes was about two-thirds of that of adults' blood monocytes. the numbers of cord blood and adults' monocytes with fc gamma and c3b receptors were similar. phagocytic and intracellular killing capacities of cord blood granulocytes and monocytes were investigated for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, and group b streptococcus type  iii. the rates of phagocytosis and intracellular killing by granulocytes from newborns proved to be comparable to the corresponding values for granulocytes from adults. cord blood monocytes phagocytosed e. coli, s. aureus, and s. pyogenes at a normal rate, and killed ingested e. coli and s. pyogenes intracellularly at the same rate as adults' monocytes did. however, s. aureus was killed at a much lower rate by cord blood monocytes than by monocytes from adults. phagocytic activity for group b streptococcus was impaired and killing of these bacteria by cord blood monocytes was virtually nil. the latter finding might partially explain the frequent streptococcal infections in newborns.

TI  == properties of atp-dependent protein kinase from streptococcus pyogenes that phosphorylates a seryl residue in hpr, a phosphocarrier protein of the phosphotransferase system.
AB  == transport of sugars across the cytoplasmic membranes of gram-positive bacteria appears to be regulated by the action of a metabolite-activated, atp-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates a seryl residue in the phosphocarrier protein  of the phosphotransferase system, hpr. we have developed a quantitative assay for measuring the activity of this enzyme from streptococcus pyogenes. the product of the in vitro protein kinase-catalyzed reaction was shown to be phosphoseryl-hpr by several independent criteria (rates of hydrolysis in the presence of various agents, detection of serine-phosphate in acid hydrolysates, immunological assay,  and electrophoretic migration rates). hprs isolated from four different gram-positive bacteria (s. pyogenes, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis) were shown to be phosphorylated by the kinase from s. pyogenes. in contrast, escherichia coli hpr was not a substrate of this enzyme. the soluble kinase released from the particulate fraction of the cells with high salt in the presence of a protease inhibitor was shown to have an approximate molecular weight of 60,000 as estimated by gel filtration. its activity was dependent on divalent cations, with mg2+ and mn2+ being most active. edta, pi, and high concentrations of salt were strongly inhibitory. the enzyme was optimally active at ph 7.0, exhibited high affinity for its substrates, and was dependent on the presence of one of several metabolites. of these compounds,  fructose 1-6-diphosphate was most active, with gluconate 6-phosphate, 2-phosphoglycerate, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate exhibiting moderate to low stimulatory activities. other compounds tested, including a variety of sugar phosphates, pyridine nucleotides, and other metabolites were without effect. the atp-dependent phosphorylation of hpr on the  seryl residue was strongly inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of the active histidyl residue of this protein. treatment of the  kinase with diethyl pyrocarbonate strongly inhibited the atp-dependent phosphorylation activity, although the sulfhydryl reagents n-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and iodoacetate were without effect. these results serve to characterize the hpr (serine) kinase, which apparently regulates the rates of  carbohydrate transport in streptococcal cells via the phosphotransferase system.  a primary role of this kinase in the control of cellular inducer levels and carbohydrate metabolic rates is proposed.

TI  == wide-spectrum antibiotic activity of bovine granulocyte polypeptides.
AB  == the antibiotic activity of a polypeptide fraction purified from bovine granulocyte granules was tested against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, bacillus stearothermophilus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, and clinical isolates of staphylococcus and enterobacter  spp. all of these bacterial species were susceptible to the antibiotic polypeptide(s), with mics ranging from 3 to 100 micrograms of protein per ml. the antimicrobial activity was resistant to boiling and abolished by proteinase treatment. saccharomyces cerevisiae and human fibroblasts grew normally in the presence of 100 and 50 micrograms of antibiotic polypeptide(s) per ml, respectively. [3h]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, dna was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. this suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial dna.

TI  == an extended model for transfer of micro-organisms via the hands: differences between organisms and the effect of alcohol disinfection.
AB  == a model for contact transfer of micro-organisms by hand has been extended to include representatives of bacterial species responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections. the ability of the organisms to transfer from contaminated fabrics to hands and from hands to sterile fabrics was measured, as  was their ability to survive on the skin of the hands. there were differences between the species. staphylococcus saprophyticus transferred well to the hand but not as well from hand to fabric as the other species; it survived well on skin. pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella aerogenes and serratia marcescens transferred moderately well overall and also survived on the skin. these results  were in contrast to those obtained with a strain of escherichia coli and one of streptococcus pyogenes. the contact transfer model was used to investigate the use of small volumes of alcohol in preventing transfer via the hands. an alcohol  handrub of either 0.3 ml 80% ethanol or 0.3 ml 70% isopropanol gave reductions in transfer slightly less than that of a soap and water wash. raising the volume, and consequently the contact time, to 0.5 ml 70% isopropanol gave a 14000-fold reduction in transfer, statistically indistinguishable from that of a thorough soap and water wash (9800-fold reduction).

TI  == ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin.
AB  == the present study describes the ability of various oral bacteria to bind human plasma fibronectin (pfn). avid binding of 125i-pfn was found for streptococcus mutans (serotypes a to h), streptococcus sanguis, group a streptococcus pyogenes  and staphylococcus aureus, while other gram-positive bacterial species tested demonstrated only weak or negligible pfn binding ability. two gram-negative bacterial species, bacteroides gingivalis and escherichia coli, did not significantly bind pfn. 125i-pfn binding to s. mutans 6715 cells was decreased by pretreatment with unlabeled pfn, and the radiolabeled pfn bound to the cell surface was released on addition of unlabeled pfn. strong inhibition of 125i-pfn  binding to s. mutans 6715 cells was obtained by protease pretreatment, while partial inhibition was also observed following treatment with acid, alkali, lipase, and monoclonal anti-polyglycerophosphate. these results suggest that pfn  binding to s. mutans cells is reversible and that pfn receptors on the cell surface appear to be heat-stable multiple proteins.

TI  == group a streptococcal phage t12 carries the structural gene for pyrogenic exotoxin type a.
AB  == the structural gene for group a streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (spe) type a was cloned into e. coli. dna fragments used for cloning the toxin gene were isolated  from bacteriophage t12. toxin, present in cell lysates of e. coli clones, immunoprecipitated with antisera raised against purified spe type a and formed a  line of identity with streptococcal-derived a toxin. the cloned toxin shared the  following biological activities with streptococcal a toxin: pyrogenicity; enhancement of host susceptibility to lethal endotoxin shock; nonspecific lymphocyte mitogenicity; and alteration of immunoglobulin production. the physical location of the toxin gene on the phage t12 genome was determined.

TI  == antibacterial activity of palmitoyltuberactinamine n and di-beta-lysylcapreomycin iia.
AB  == palmitoyltuberactinamine n (pal-tua n) and di-beta-lysylcapreomycin iia (di-beta-lys-cpm iia), which are synthetic derivatives of the antituberculous agent tuberactinomycin (tum) and capreomycin (cpm) respectively, were tested for  anti-bacterial activity. pal-tua n inhibited not only tuberactinomycin-resistant  mycobacterium smegmatis but also escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, although it has lost activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis. di-beta-lys-cpm iia inhibited the growth of laboratory-derived tum-resistant m. smegmatis and m. tuberculosis as well as tum-resistant m. tuberculosis from patients with one exceptional case.

TI  == atp-dependent protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of a seryl residue in hpr, a phosphate carrier protein of the phosphotransferase system in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == hpr, a phosphate carrier protein of the streptococcal phosphotransferase system,  is phosphorylated at the n-1 position of a single histidyl residue in a reaction  requiring phosphoenolpyruvate (p-eprv), mg2+, and enzyme i (p-eprv-hpr phosphotransferase, ec2.7.3.9). we demonstrate that in addition to this reaction, a seryl residue within hpr can be phosphorylated in an atp-dependent process. this reaction is catalyzed by a protein kinase with an approximate mr of 20,000.  in whole cells the kinase activity is stimulated by glucose, whereas in crude extracts the activity is stimulated by glycolytic intermediates such as glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and 2-phosphoglycerate. p-(ser)-hpr cannot transfer its phosphate group via enzyme ii to a sugar as does the p-(his)-hpr. instead, a phosphatase (mr = 70,000) was found to hydrolyze the phosphate group of p-(ser)-hpr. the phosphatase reaction is strongly inhibited by the addition of p-eprv and enzyme i. protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the enzyme constituents of the phosphotransferase system in escherichia coli has also been demonstrated. these observations lead us to suggest that phosphorylation of a seryl residue in hpr is involved in the regulation of sugar transport in the bacteria cell.

TI  == pathogenicity of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus group, b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus (bm) group and four clinical isolates of b. oralis and b. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal abscesses. only 11 isolates of bm group and one b. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). when the other 23 isolates, however, were injected sc in combination with either klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. the bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. capsules also formed in bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of k. pneumoniae or encapsulated bacteroides sp. once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.

TI  == adherence of streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa to fibronectin-coated and uncoated epithelial cells.
AB  == the relationship between the variability in the fibronectin (fn) content on human buccal epithelial cells and the capacity of the cells to bind gram-positive (streptococcus pyogenes) or gram-negative (escherichia coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria was investigated. adhesion experiments performed with mixtures of epithelial cells and mixed suspensions of either s. pyogenes and e. coli or s. pyogenes and p. aeruginosa exhibited three major populations of buccal cells: one of these was able to bind s. pyogenes (gram positive) but neither of the gram-negative bacteria; a second population was able to bind the gram-negative but not the gram-positive bacteria; and a third was able to bind various numbers of both types of organisms. further adhesion experiments performed with a mixture of epithelial cells and a mixed suspension of s. pyrogens, e. coli, and fluoresceinconjugated methacrylate beads coated with immune immunoglobulin g directed against fn revealed that the epithelial cells recognizing the gram-positive bacteria were rich in fn, whereas those recognizing the gram-negative organisms were poor in fn. immunoelectron microscopy confirmed  that cells of s. pyogenes bound to epithelial cells coated with fn, whereas cells of e. coli bound to epithelial cells lacking fn. these results suggest that fn on the surfaces of epithelial cells may modulate the ecology of the human oropharyngeal cavity, especially with respect to the colonization of these surfaces by pathogenic gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == [susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  == cefpiramide (cpm, sm-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. antibacterial activities of cpm against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, bordetella pertussis and proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (cpz). antibacterial activities of cpm against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of cpz, but antibacterial activity of  cpm against pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of cpz and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. antibacterial activity of cpm has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (pcase type) producing s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, etc. it is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of cpm against pathogenic organisms but also the  beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of cpm.

TI  == susceptibility of brain to aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal organisms.
AB  == the utility of an experimental animal model is dependent on its ability to simulate the actual clinical situation. with a stereotaxic injection procedure, the susceptibility of rat brain to the spectrum of organisms commonly associated  with human brain abscess was determined. two strains of escherichia coli were more infective than pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. even between the e. coli strains it was possible to document significant differences in degree of infectivity. the e. coli strain with the k-1 capsular polysaccharide was significantly more infective than the e. coli strain without the capsular polysaccharide. the brain was also susceptible to candida albicans, but at a level higher than any of the aerobic bacteria examined. brain infection could not be created when microaerophilic or obligately anaerobic organisms alone were injected.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis of the hemolysin (cereolysin) determinant from bacillus cereus.
AB  == from a cosmid gene bank of bacillus cereus gp4 in escherichia coli we isolated clones which, after several days of incubation, formed hemolysis zones on erythrocyte agar plates. these clones contained recombinant cosmids with b. cereus dna insertions of varying lengths which shared some common restriction fragments. the smallest insertion was recloned as a psti fragment into pjkk3-1, a shuttle vector which replicates in bacillus subtilis and e. coli. when this recombinant plasmid (pjkk3-1 hly-1) was transformed into e. coli, it caused hemolysis on erythrocyte agar plates, but in liquid assays no external or internal hemolytic activity could be detected with the e. coli transformants. b.  subtilis carrying the same plasmid exhibited hemolytic activity at levels comparable to those of the b. cereus donor strain. the hemolysin produced in b. subtilis seemed to be indistinguishable from cereolysin in its sensitivity to cholesterol, activation by dithiothreitol, and inactivation by antibodies raised  against cereolysin. when the recombinant dna carrying the cereolysin gene was used as a probe in hybridization experiments with chromosomal dna from a streptolysin o-producing strain of streptococcus pyogenes or from listeriolysin-producing strains of listeria monocytogenes, no positive hybridization signals were obtained. these data suggest that the genes for these  three sh-activated cytolysins do not have extended sequence homology.

AB  == the alpha-hemolytic streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains  of serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium diphtheriae. however, strans of escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. the mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.

AB  == studies on t-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, were carried out  in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. peak mic  of t-1982 against s. pyogenes (group a) lately isolated was 0.39 micrograms/ml, and the drug was active even against highly resistant strains of macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2. peak mics of t-1982 were 0.78 microgram/ml against b. pertussis, 0.2 microgram/ml against e. coli and less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml against k. oxytoca, and the drug was also active against ampicillin-resistant bacteria. 3. serum levels and urinary excretions of  t-1982 were investigated in 6 cases. when given at a dose of 20-28 mg/kg by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, serum concentrations of t-1982 attained the peak  level of 63.5-75.9 micrograms/ml at the end of administration and sustained the level of 0.9-2.6 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, the serum half-life (t 1/2) ranging 70-82 minutes. approximately 20-72% of the dose were excreted in the active form  into urine within 6 hours. 4. twenty-seven cases of acute pediatric infections were treated with t-1982 mainly by intravenous drip infusion, and satisfactory clinical results were obtained in all the cases of angina lacunaris, bronchitis,  bronchopneumonia, pertussis, sepsis caused by serratia and acute urinary tract infections caused by ampicillin-resistant e. coli. the efficacy rate was 96.3%. in this study the drug was administered chiefly at a daily dose of 50-70 mg/kg 2-3 times a day for 2-12 days. 5. gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, s. pneumoniae,  s. pyogenes) and gram-negative rods (h. influenzae, h. parainfluenzae p. vulgaris, b. pertussis, s. marcescens, e. coli) were eradicated by the treatment  with t-1982. 6. no noticeable side effects were observed, except for temporary increase of eosinophil in 2 cases and slight elevation of got in 1 case.

AB  == the specificity and sensitivity of agglutination, complement fixation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) procedures in the detection of antibodies to haemophilus somnus was investigated. h. somnus rabbit immune sera were found to agglutinate pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, and haemophilus agni and, in some instances, also pasteurella haemolytica, salmonella dublin, streptococcus agalactiae, and corynebacterium pyogenes. in complement fixation tests with saline extracts as antigens, only h. agni reacted with h. somnus antisera to any significant degree. in elisa tests with sonicated or heat-extracted antigens, cross-reactions were seen with the two pasteurella spp.  and with h. agni. when whole cells and saline extracts were used as antigens in elisas, only h. agni showed any cross-reactivity. the greatest specificity in distinguishing homologous from heterologous reactions was achieved by elisa with  saline extracts as antigens. escherichia coli and brucella abortus antigens failed to react with h. somnus antibody in any of the tests. a rabbit serum containing antibody to bovine type isolates of p. multocida, p. haemolytica, s. aureus, s. agalactiae, s. dublin, c. pyogenes, and e. coli gave no positive reaction in elisa tests with saline extract of h. somnus as antigen. it is concluded that such saline extract, which appears to consist largely of h. somnus common antigen, has the potential of being a useful diagnostic reagent in the study by elisa of antibody response to h. somnus.

AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.

AB  == the present paper reviews our recent studies concerning the intracellular killing of bacteria by human monocytes and compares the results with those found for circulating granulocytes. the findings show that optimal intracellular killing of catalase-positive and catalase-negative bacteria is only reached during interaction of the fc part of igg and complement component c3b with their specific receptors in the membrane of the phagocytes. similar stimulation was found during interaction of plant lectins and their specific sugar moieties in the cell membrane. the studies permit the general conclusion that optimal intracellular killing of micro-organisms requires membrane stimulation, which occurs after triggering of certain receptors.

TI  == the role of bacterial adherence in infection.
AB  == the data presented in this review indicate that bacteria have developed mechanisms to facilitate adherence to target mammalian cells, often present in filamentous structures of varying organization at the cell surface, classified together as adhesins. these may contain distinctive molecular sequences, often including sugars, which function as ligands for specific interactions with receptors on mammalian cells. such receptor-ligand interactions determine species, organ, and cell specificity of adherence by individual bacterial strains. in some examples, this adherence phenomenon can be demonstrated to be an essential virulence attributed of pathogens which must adhere in order to colonize and then cause disease. while considerable detailed knowledge has accumulated about certain adhesins (e.g., k-88) or some mammalian cell receptors  (e.g., the pk blood group-related disaccharide on human erythrocytes for pyelonephritis strains of e. coli), in no instance do we know the nature of an adhesin and its specific receptor to fully define the actual chemistry of the binding, but we undoubtedly will in the near future. avidity of adherence is attributable to multiple forces, in particular hydrophobic interactions in prokaryote-eukaryote systems. therapeutic strategies to alter these relationships and thereby to prevent or treat disease are already being applied to model in vitro and experimental in vivo infections.

TI  == participation of immunoglobulins and complement components in the intracellular killing of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli by human granulocytes.
AB  == immunoglobulins and complement components are required for optimal ingestion and  optimal killing of microorganisms by granulocytes. the degree of opsonization of  microorganisms necessary for their ingestion was lower than that required for the killing of these bacteria during the ingestion phase. killing during this phase was found to depend mainly on the presence of heat-labile opsonins, probably c3b, present on the microorganisms. extracellular immunoglobulin g (igg) and c3b were  indispensable for optimal intracellular killing after ingestion was complete. this was established with an assay permitting assessment of the course of the number of viable intracellular bacteria independent of the ingestion of new live  bacteria. maximal intracellular killing by human granulocytes of ingested catalase-positive (staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) or catalase-negative (streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae) microorganisms was found only when fresh serum was present extracellularly. killing was suboptimal in the absence of serum. with heat-inactivated serum, the killing index lay between the indices obtained in the presence and absence of fresh serum. the stimulatory activity of heat-inactivated serum was most probably due to the interaction of igg with the fc receptor on the granulocyte membrane, since igg subclasses igg1 and igg3 as well as pfc fragments of igg stimulated the intracellular killing to the same degree as heat-inactivated serum did. in addition, (fab1)2 fragments of igg did not stimulate killing, and reduced killing was observed in the presence of heat-inactivated serum after reduction of the number of fc receptors. the extra stimulation of the killing process in the presence of fresh serum compared with heat-inactivated serum was due to the interaction between membrane receptors and complement--most probably c3b generated by both the classical and the alternative pathways of complement activation. this conclusion is based on results obtained with sera in which one or both complement pathways were blocked, on the restoration of the killing-stimulatory activity of c3-deficient serum after addition of fresh c3, and on the reduced killing observed in the presence of fresh serum after reduction of the number of c3 receptors by the use of pronase or antigranulocyte  serum.

TI  == characterization of lipoteichoic acid binding to polymorphonuclear leukocytes of  human blood.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) were shown to possess specific binding sites for lipoteichoic acid (lta). lta binding was reversible and time and temperature dependent. scatchard plot analysis revealed an apparently single population of 6.6 x 10(6) lta binding sites per pmn with a dissociation constant  of 5.6 microm. attachment of an avirulent, unencapsulated, m-negative strain of group a streptococci to pmn was inhibited by lta, but not by other bacterial somatic antigens tested. occupation of 30% of the lta binding sites resulted in greater than 70% inhibition of streptococcal attachment to pmn. in contrast, lta  failed to block attachment of escherichia coli or antibody-coated streptococci, indicating that binding sites for e. coli and the fc portion of immunoglobulin g  are distinct from those for lta. immunofluorescent studies demonstrated that lta  remained uniformly bound to pmn membranes for as long as 2 h at 37 degrees c. cross-linking of pmn-bound lta with anti-lta resulted in rapid capping of lta receptor sites. the results suggest that lta is a monovalent ligand interacting with mobile receptors in the plasma membrane of pmn.

TI  == new method that uses binding of immunoglobulin a to group a streptococcal immunoglobulin a fc receptors for demonstration of microbial immunoglobulin a protease activity.
AB  == a new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin a (iga) protease which splits iga into fab and fc fragments. the method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for iga fragments occur commonly among type 4  group a streptococci. the bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified iga1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. since isolated fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal iga receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. using this method, protease activity was detected in neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus sanguis, but  not in escherichia coli or branhamella catarrhalis.

TI  == sublethal concentrations of antibiotics and bacterial adhesion.
AB  == various antibiotics in sublethal concentrations markedly impair adhesion of streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli to human cells. in streptococcal cells penicillin g caused an enhances loss of lipoteichoic acid, the ligand (adhesion) that binds the organism to host cells, with consequent loss of their adhesive properties. in e coli sublethal concentrations of penicillin prevented the surface expression of the mannose-specific adhesion by distorting cell wall biosynthesis. in contrast to streptococci, e coli cells could not be made to lose their adhesions once their adhesions once they had been formed. streptomycin in subinhibitory concentration similarly suppressed the acquisition of mannose-binding and adhesive activities in several strains of antibiotic-sensitive e. coli but not in isogenic derivatives with ribosomal mutation to high-level streptomycin resistance, rpsl, or in bacteria in the stationary phase of growth, suggesting that streptomycin exerted its sublethal suppressive effects by classic mechanisms of action on the bacterial ribosome. strain vl2, derived from one streptomycin-resistant mutant, retained a high level (1000 microgram/ml) of resistance to streptomycin but reacquired sensitivity to the sublethal effect; growth in 30 microgram streptomycin/ml suppressed mannose-sensitive haemagglutination (less than 1% of control) as well as mannose-sensitive adhesion to epithelial cells (42%) or leucocytes (7%). although these streptomycin-treated bacteria demonstrated an unaltered degree of fimbriation their fimbriae were significantly longer than those on the untreated  bacteria. furthermore, in contrast to the untreated bacteria, the fimbriae isolated from the drug-treated bacteria were found to lack mannose-binding activity as measured by haemagglutination. it therefore, appears that streptomycin can cause even resistant bacteria to produce an aberrant fimbrial protein, presumably by causing misreading in "competent" ribosomes. these studies indicate that the use of sublethal doses of certain antibiotics whose mode of action is well known may shed light on the genetic and chemical modulation of bacterial factors involved in mucosal colonization.

AB  == activity of various natural and synthetic polynucleotides as a carrier for streptolysin s was tested in a resting cell system. as the carrier, intact molecules of ms2 rna, e coli trna or rat liver rna were almost inactive, whereas  rnase i core of these rnas, especially the core fractions eluted from deae-cellulose column at higher nacl concentrations, effectively induced production of the extracellular hemolysin. the carrier activity of yeast rna was  significantly enhanced by simultaneous addition of rnase i, to the streptococcal  suspension. preincubation of yeast rna with growing streptococci or a protein fraction from the bacterial culture supernatant increased its carrier activity. evidences were obtained suggesting involvement of streptococcal nuclease in the enhancement of the carrier effect. production of the streptococcal hemolysin was  markedly promoted by polyguanylic acid but neither by polyadenylic acid, polycytidylic acid nor by polyuridylic acid. like trypan blue, polyguanylic acid  exerted potent inhibitory effect on hemolytic activity of streptolysin s complex. similar but less marked effect was observed with certain rnase i core fractions of rat liver rna. some data concerning effect of polynucleotides on stability of  the hemolysin were also presented.

TI  == a survey of mastitis in the british dairy herd.
AB  == five hundred herds were examined to determine the prevalence of subclinical mastitis in the british dairy herd. the prevalences of the various infections recorded were streptococcus agalactiae 3.4 per cent of quarters, s dysgalactiae 1.1 per cent, s uberis 1.5 per cent and staphylococcus pyogenes 8.1 per cent. there were regional differences in the prevalence of some of these pathogens. the national prevalence of subclinical mastitis as defined by the international dairy federation was 9.6 per cent of all quarters. udder infections were less prevalent in herds where mastitis control measures were being used. the prevalence of infection also declined as the size of herd increased. however, as the uptake of  mastitis control measures was greater in the larger herds it seems likely that the widespread use of control measures was the most important factor responsible  for the relatively low prevalence of subclinical mastitis.

TI  == microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of iran.
AB  == a total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. a total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera corynebacterium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus and pasteurella, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. peptostreptococcus anaerobius and eubacterium tortuosum were  isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. it was determined that 11 isolates of corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of p multocida, and 1 of c pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. two of the c pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. as determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. in nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with c pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly przhevalskiana silenus  at the site of infection.

AB  == a total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. these strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, ly127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (hr 756), and cefoperazone (t 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the  same hospital in 1979. susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two  nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins  and other effective antibiotics. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. the multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. both klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935 and cefotaxime. p. aeruginosa  (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. all three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935. the three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to  ly127935. none of the three new beta-lactams was active against s. faecalis. all  were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == bactericidal effect of oleic acid on group a streptococci: mechanism of action.
AB  == in contrast to staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, group  a streptococci are infrequently present on normal human skin, except in certain populations with endemic impetigo. this has been attributed to differences in susceptibility to the bactericidal effect of skin surface lipids, particularly unsaturated fatty acids. when an m type 6 strain group a streptococcus was exposed to 500 mug of oleic acid per ml, viable counts decreased by 4 logs in 5 min. the rank order of killing was 35 > 20 > 4 degrees c. oleic acid did not kill a strain of s. aureus, a strain of coagulase-negative staphylococcus, or a strain of escherichia coli, but bound rapidly to these bacteria as well as to the group  a streptococcus. the loss of [(3)h]uridine from labeled oleic acid-treated group  a streptococcal cells was greater than 100 times that of controls. there was no loss of [(3)h]-thymidine from group a streptococci or of [(3)h]uridine or [(3)h]thymidine from identically exposed coagulase-negative staphylococci. when [(3)h]uridine was added to group a streptococci during mid-log-phase growth, cessation of uptake occurred within 5 min of addition of 50 mug of oleic acid per ml. electron microscopic changes seen within 5 min included condensation of the nucleoid and distortion of the streptococcal surface by numerous clumps and blebs. coagulase-negative staphylococci, s. aureus, and e. coli similarly exposed showed no comparable electron microscopic changes. we propose that oleic acid kills group a streptococci by altering the integrity of the cell membrane with resulting loss of ribonucleic acid but not deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  == experimental syphilis in the rabbit: passive transfer of immunity with immunoglobulin g from immune serum.
AB  == a preparation of immunoglobulin g isolated from a pool of immune sera derived from rabbits with long-term syphilis was shown to possess a high degree of purity as judged by immunodiffusion and protein electrophoresis. the antitreponemal power of the preparation of immunoglobulin g and that of the immune serum pool from which it was derived were found to be equivalent in both the skin protection and the systemic protection test. the observation that neither normal serum nor a pool of serum derived from animals "immunized" with salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, or zymosan was protective indicates that the protective power of the immune serum studied was due to specific antibodies residing principally, if not entirely, in the immunoglobulin g fraction of the serum.

AB  == the activity of cathepsin b was assayed in murine resident peritoneal macrophages, and after stimulation of the cells in vivo and in vitro. the resident cells showed a very low activity of the enzyme, compared to the activities of three other lysosomal enzymes: cathepsin d, acid phosphatase, and beta-glucuronidase which were tested simultaneously. endocytosis of carrageenan,  latex, or carbon particles in vitro induced a prominent rise in intracellular cathepsin b activity. addition of endotoxin from escherichia coli in vivo or in vitro, or cell wall products from streptococci in vitro caused no change in cathepsin b activity. there was a release of enzyme activity to the medium after  a 72-hour culture of macrophages. however, the release, calculated as a percentage of total activity, was not influenced by any treatments mentioned. all significant rises in enzyme activity could be inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide, and it was concluded that increased enzyme activity was dependent  on new protein synthesis.

AB  == cefadroxil (duricef, mead johnson and company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates  under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. in this kinetic model, cefadroxil  was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of escherichia coli. the other strain of e. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. s. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.

TI  == the recovery period following exposure of bacteria to penicillins.
AB  == experiments with staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes have shown that when cells are exposed to bactericidal concentration of benzylpenicillin or ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated with beta-lactamase the count of the surviving viable cells (colony-forming units) remains essentially constant for a period of approximately 1.5--3 h before increasing at a normal rate. no such recovery period was observed, however, when escherichia coli or proteus mirabilis was exposed to a bactericidal concentration of ampicillin and the antibiotic then inactivated. microscopic observation of individual surviving cells of s. aureus following exposure to benzylpenicillin showed that in some cases resumption of cell division was delayed as long as 4 h. however, other cells in the same population showed no recovery period and resumed division within 30 min of inactivation of the antibiotic. in the latter case, the recovery period which is observed in terms of viable count may represent the period of time required for individual surviving cells to divide and give rise to normal aggregates before these fragment to produce new colony-forming units.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean mics of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. however, the mbc for penicillin-resistant s. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. all strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus mirabilis, and hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. eighty per cent of strains of h. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. most strains of enterobacter sp., indole-positive proteus, pseudomonas sp., and serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.

TI  == observation on the bacterial population of the os cervix of the ewe before and after embryo death.
AB  == bacterial samples were isolated from the os cervix of mature merino ewes during a normal oestrous cycle and after colchicine treatment which killed the 25-day old  embryos. the population of bacteria was small during the oestrous cycle and consisted of achromobacter spp. alcaligenes spp, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp and escherichia coli. there was a significant increase in the numbers of bacteria isolated and a change in the proportions of the bacteria isolated from ewes after embryo death. much greater numbers of potentially pathogenic organisms, including pasteurella multocida, corynebacterium pyogenes, staphylococcus spp and streptococcus spp were isolated after embryos were killed. it is suggested that persistence of potential pathogens in the vagina may impair  fertility in ewes at the first oestrus after embryo death.

(2) it was suposed that acpc was more resistant to penicillinase and more antibacterial with inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml cells/ml than with 10(6) cells/ml. acpc was 4 approximately 8 times less active than abpc, and ampc against staphylococcus aureus with 10(8) cells/ml, while with 10(6) cells/ml, it was 2 times less active than abpc and ampc. (3) acpc-resistant strains (greater than or equal to 3.13 microng/ml) of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were not found.

TI  == peripheral dissemination of bacteria in contaminated wounds; role of devitalized  tissue: evaluation of therapeutic measures.
AB  == the role of available therapeutic agents in the management of infection has long  been a continuing source of debate. this study assessed the rapidity of lateral dissemination of three common pyogenic organisms from wounds. the streptococcus spreads peripherally with greater speed than the staphylococcus or e. coli. appraisal of the role and effectiveness of jet wound irrigation, debridement, and penicillin provides firm evidence that, of these three therapeutic agents, the only one that can control bacterial proliferation in a contaminated wound is the  antibiotic. the primary role of energized jet irrigation is to remove clots and wound debris. the specific function of debridement is removal of devitalized tissue, in which role it has no effective competitor. these studies demonstrate that devitalized tissue in a contaminated wound quickens the rapidity of peripheral spread of all three micro-organisms. systemic penicillin plus saline irrigation is the most effective therapeutic measure at both the second and fourth postinoculation hours in nondevitalized contaminated wounds. debridement proved to be the most effective therapeutic device at the second, fourth, and sixth postinoculation hours in devitalized wounds.

TI  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin c derivative i. in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  == ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6r,7r)-8-oxo-7[2-(1h-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens and proteus vulgaris. the activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of escherichia coli and klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of p. mirabilis. the in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against both s. aureus and e. coli. the development in vitro  of resistance by s. aureus 209p and e. coli nihj to ceftezole after 16 transfers  was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. ceftezole was  relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with  streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae or p. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. however, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with s. aureus.

AB  == an extracellular bacteriocidal substance is produced by a serotype c strain of streptococcus mutans in liquid meduim during the stationary phase of growth. the  lethal effect of the substance was demonstrated by the decrease in viable counts  of a standardized suspension of group a streptococci in broth. no lysis of affected cells was observed and no changes in appearance of these cells was seen  in electron micrographs. the material was effective against certain strains of immmunological groups a, c, d, g, h, l, and o streptococci. it was inactive against strains of s. mutans belonging to the a, b, c, and d serotypes, bacillus  subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. the factor was purified 273-fold from the culture fluid by column chromatography. it was sensitive to trysin and pronase and resistant to catalase. it possessed a  molecular weight of more than 20,000 and was not dialyzable. the properties of this substance indicate that it is a bacteriocin. group a streptococci, which had been treated with antiserum specific for the cell wall group and type antigens, were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcal strains resistant to the lethal action of the bacteriocin adsorbed the bacteriocin from the solutions, as  did the sensitive cells. the bacteriocin was not adsorbed at 0 c.

AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

AB  == a sensitive assay was developed for detection and quantitation of subtle permeability changes in the cytoplasmic membrane of human diploid fibroblasts. release of the non-metabolizable amino acid [1-14c]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (aib; molecular weight (103) from the cytoplasm of prelabeled cells was used as an indicator of toxin-induced membrane damage. an optimal procedure for labeling  these cells was designed after varying the conditions with regard to ph, temperature, concentration of aib, composition of medium, and incubation time. toxin-induced release of aib was compared with release of a previously described  nucleotide label, [3h]uridine. melittin from bee venom and the polyene antibiotics filipin and amphotericin b in low concentrations induced a strikingly greater release of aib than of nucleotide label. the sensitivity of this assay was furthermore demonstrated by treatment with the following bacterial cytolysins: phospholipase c and theta-toxin from clostridium perfringens, alpha-, beta-, delta-, and gamma-toxins from staphylococcus aureus, and streptolysin s from streptococcus pyogenes. in spite of their different modes of action, all these membrane-active toxins at low concentrations induced a significant release  of aib label. for an equal release of nucleotide label, several times higher concentrations were required.

TI  == massive empyema due to citrobacter diversus.
AB  == citrobacter diversus is a gram-negative rod member of the enterobacteriacease family. a patient is described from whom this organism was isolated twice in pure culture from empyema fluid. our isolates of citrobacter diversus were resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin and sensitive to cephalothin. citrobacter diversus should be distinguished from citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae  and klebsiella pneumoniae. this organism joins streptococcus pyogenes, bacteroids species, anaerobic streptococci and escherichia coli as a cause of slight pneumonia with extensive empyema.

TI  == interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  == contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (stic) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the stic has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. cultures of enterobacter, klebsiella,  bacillus subtilis, and pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in  the presence of human serum. the enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the stic. care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an sticassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of mannopeptins.
AB  == mannopeptins show in vitro antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and some  gram-negative bacteria. the antimicrobial activity is unaffected by the addition  of serum, and potentiated by alkaline ph or decrease in inoculum size. the antibiotics exert bectericidal effect at doses twice as high as the minimum inhibitory concentration. when the antibiotics were injected into mice through either intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes, the antimicrobial activity appeared within 15 minutes in the serum of mice and was slowly excreted in the urine. however, the antibiotics were poorly absorbed by the oral route. the antibiotics were capable of protecting mice from lethal infection produced by the intravenous injection of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and the intraperitoneal injection of shigella sp. and escherichia coli, but ineffective against salmonella typhosa.

TI  == endotoxin-like properties of the peptidoglycan.
AB  == peptidoglycan is responsible for the endotoxin-like properties of the streptococcus cell wall. the pyrogenic response of rabbit to group a streptococcus peptidoglycan prepared by hot formamide or tca is dose-dependent and is increased if the material is ultrasonically solubilized. the pyrogenicity  can be eliminated by the antiserum to the peptidoglycan or by the degradation of  the material by lysozyme. peptidoglycans prepared from cell walls of group b and  l streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus pneumoniae produce fever effects comparable to the response after group a streptococcus peptidoglycan. spirillum serpens and escherichia coli contain in addition to endotoxin the peptidoglycan which is also pyrogenic. repeated injections of bacterial peptidoglycan to rabbit result in tolerance to the fever effect. cross-tolerance was recorded only exceptionally. rabbits tolerant to endotoxin respond with a lower fever to s. aureus and group a streptococcus peptidoglycans. intravenous administration of peptidoglycan to rabbit causes extensive alterations in the heart characterized by various stages  of the degenerative and necrotic process. local shwartzman reaction can be elicited in rabbit by peptidoglycan used either as a preparative or as a provocative dose in combination with endotoxin, or it can be used for both doses. the results obtained with peptidoglycans prepared from various bacteria are fully comparable. non-specific resistance of mice to infection induced by streptococcus cell walls was found to be dependent on the peptidoglycan activity; cell wall proteins and polysaccharide are inactive. these properties of peptidoglycan resemble those known from endotoxin studies. the data presented suggest the role  of peptidoglycan in pathological reactions resulting from host-parasite interaction.

TI  == the role of fomites in the transmission of vaginitis.
AB  == a role for fomites such as toilet seats in the transmission of vaginitis has never been proved or disproved. a compilation of clinical data from a university  community showed that the organisms found in vaginal cultures of patients with vaginitis were, in order of frequency. candida albicans, escherichia coli, beta-hemolytic streptococci, hemophilus vaginalis and trichomonas vaginalis. in a concurrent bacteriologic survey of washroom fixtures, staphylococci and other micrococci were isolated most frequently. the overt pathogens associated with vaginitis were never found, and gram-negative organisms appeared to be suppressed by the disinfectant used by the cleaning staff. it is clear that fomites are not  an important mode of transmission in vaginitis, although a search for specific pathogens on toilets is to be continued.

TI  == the effect of leukocyte hydrolases on bacteria. iii. bacteriolysis induced by extracts of different leukocyte populations and the inhibition of lysis by macromolecular substances.
AB  == the lysis of 14c-labeled bacteria by hydrolases of human and rabbit leukocytes was studied in vitro. while staphylococcus albus, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans were highly susceptible to lysis, staphylococcus auresus was intermediate in its susecptibility to lysis by the leukocyte enzymes. group a streptococcus, listeria monocytogenes, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, and mycobacterium smegmatis were very resistant to degradation by these enzymes. the  lytic activity of leukocyte lysates from human and rabbit blood was probably due  to acid hydrolases of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. extracts of human blood monocytes and of rabbit peritoneal and lung macrophages were less lytic for the bacteria tested. lymphocytes and platelet extracts were not bacteriolytic. the lytic effect of the leukocyte lysates was not inhibited by kcn or sodium azide, but was abolished to a large extent by cationic polyelectrolytes such as protamine sulfate, histone and leukocyte cationic proteins, and poly-lysine, as well as by the anionic polyelectrolytes such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, dna, carrageenin, alginate sulfate, dextran sulfate, and ploy-l-glutamic acid. other potent inhibitors of bacteriolysis were trypan blue, congo red, phosphatidic acid, normal immunoglobulins, and components of streptococcal cell wall.

(1966) except for small differences in the products of lysis of streptococcal cell walls and the resistance of escherichia coli to lysis by the f1 enzyme. lysates of group a and a variant streptococcal cell walls prepared with purified streptomyces albus muramidase contained serologically active m protein and c carbohydrate-peptidoglycan complexes. the chemical and immunological characteristics of these enzymmatic products of streptococcal cell  walls are reported and their utility as immunologic reagents is described.

TI  == doxycycline in respiratory tract infections. a review of a multi-centre trial.
AB  == a total of 256 patients were admitted in germany into a pan-european multi centre trial of doxycycline in the treatment of infections of the respiratory tract. the diagnoses showed a preponderance of lower respiratory tract infections compared with other european countries, due largely to the fact that the participating physicians were pulmonary or internal medicine specialists. doxycycline was given in a dose of 200 mg initially followed by 100 mg daily for 5-10 days (only the occasional patient varied from this regimen). side-effects were uncommon (2.5-3.5%) and affected only the gastrointestinal tract. four patients had to change antibiotic therapy, not because of side-effects but because of possible bacterial resistance in these patients. the results were comparable with those from the rest of europe: 88% of patients had a good or very good response. nine patients were treated for longer than 14 days and only eight patients did not show improvement.

TI  == interaction of clindamycin and gentamicin in vitro.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and gentamicin alone and in  combinations were determined by a microdilution method for 163 aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic clinical isolates. all 77 strains of staphylococcus aureus, diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and anaerobic bacteria (except for three strains of clostridium) were inhibited by 1.6 mug or less of clindamycin per ml. gentamicin did not interfere with the activity of clindamycin within the range of concentrations tested (0.1 to 100 mug/ml); for some strains combinations were synergistic. sixty-two (94%) of 66 strains of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 6.2 mug or less of gentamicin per ml. combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 29 strains and synergistic for 33 strains. all 20 strains of enterococcus, three strains of clostridium, three strains of escherichia coli, and one strain of proteus rettgeri were resistant to both clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml) and gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml). combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains. except for clindamycin-sensitive isolates, synergy was usually observed  only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo. antagonism was never observed.

AB  == a new antimicrobial nitrofuran designated sq 18,506 showed some therapeutic activity when administered orally to mice infected with escherichia coli, salmonella schottmuelleri, shigella flexneri, or klebsiella pneumoniae. animals infected parenterally with streptococcus pyogenes, proteus mirabilis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and candida albicans, or topically with trichophyton  mentagrophytes, did not respond to therapy with the drug at the dosage levels used. the compound was as effective as metronidazole in the topical treatment of  experimental trichomonal infections in mice and in guinea pigs and as effective as nystatin, candicidin, or a sulfanilamide-aminacrine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of a candidal vaginal infection in rats. the chemotherapeutic efficacy  of sq 18,506 in experimental vaginitis caused by escherichia coli in the rat surpassed that shown by four commercial products available for the treatment of bacterial vaginitis.

AB  == the d- and l-isomers of beta-chloroalanine inhibit the growth of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. with pneumococcus the inhibition by beta-chloro-d-alanine is completely prevented by either d-alanine or d-alanyl-d-alanine, while l-alanine is not effective in preventing the inhibition. the inhibition of growth by beta-chloro-l-alanine is not affected by d-alanine and is only partially prevented by high concentrations  of l-alanine. the intracellular free alanine in untreated e. coli and b. subtilis is about 95% in the d-configuration while the free intracellular alanine in both  organisms after treatment with beta-chloro-d-alanine is predominantly the l-isomer. these results suggested that the beta-chloroamino acid inactivates alanine racemase (ec 5.1.1.1). indeed, when extracts of e. coli or b. subtilis were treated with beta-chloro-d-alanine, the activities of alanine racemase and of d-glutamate-d-alanine transaminase were found to be 90-95% inhibited. studies  with mice have shown that beta-chloro-d-alanine is an effective antibacterial agent in vivo againt d. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and e. coli.

AB  == the interaction of several common strains of bacteria with rabbit or human platelets in vitro has been examined sequentially with scanning and transmission  electron microscopy. bacteria were added to platelets in their native plasma or to washed platelets in a balanced salt solution at ratios of about 1:1 or at low  bacteria to platelet ratios (down to 1:100). the platelet-bacterial interaction (pbi) was studied with recording nephelometry. matched samples were fixed for microscopy at various points in the aggregation response. the results support these conclusions: a) bacteria stimulate platelet aggregation by direct contact and adhesion with the platelet surface. b) adhesion between the two cell types requires divalent cations, occurs through fusion of normal cell-surface coats and appears identical in the presence or absence of extracellular plasma protein. c)  the morphologic transformation of platelets during pbi is identical to that produced by collagen. d) during pbi the bacteria are incorporated into the forming platelet aggregates and reside predominantly intercellularly. e) phagocytosis of bacteria by a single platelet is very rare. f) bacteria which have resided within platelet aggregates for one hour are unaltered morphologically. g) pbi occurs even at very low bacterial numbers and produces platelet-bacterial aggregates in small numbers without stimulating generalized platelet aggregation. methods for concentration of thrombocytopenic plasma and washing human platelets are presented.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of four aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, sch 13706, tobramycin, and sisomicin) was tested against eight gram-negative and three gram-positive species. a total of 323 strains were studied by the broth dilution technique. tobramycin and sisomicin had greater bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against pseudomonas strains than did gentamicin and sch 13706. of the four antibiotics, sisomicin was most active against klebsiella, enterobacter, escherichia coli, indole-negative and -positive proteus, and streptococcus pyogenes. gentamicin was most effective against serratia. a fourfold or greater difference existed frequently between the minimal inhibitory  and bactericidal concentrations of all antibiotics against enterobacter and serratia. this difference was greatest with tobramycin. staphylococcus aureus was highly susceptible, providencia relatively resistant, and enterococcus uniformly  resistant to the antibiotics studied. agar diffusion susceptibility testing with  gentamicin and tobramycin showed that organisms susceptible to less than 6.2 mug/ml usually yielded zones 17 to 26 mm in diameters. zones of 15 to 16 mm represented intermediate susceptibility which varied with the organism and antibiotic. several serratia strains required 6.2 to 12.5 mug of gentamicin/ml or 25 to 50 mug of tobramycin/ml for bactericidal activity despite minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.09 to 3.1 mug/ml and zone sizes greater than 13 and 17 mm, respectively. studies with enterobacter and tobramycin yielded similar results.

AB  == bl-s 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature  of the assay medium. when assayed in nutrient agar, bl-s 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, and indole-positive proteus sp. however, when assayed in mueller-hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. the in vivo activity of bl-s 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. when bl-s 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. bl-s 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. recovery of bl-s 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.

TI  == butirosin, a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex: antibacterial activity in vitro and in mice.
AB  == butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. significantly susceptible bacteria include strains  of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae,  proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris, salmonella enteritidis and s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri and s. sonnei. good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained  in various acute mouse infections. butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin.
AB  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin, is active against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. although the ester has in vitro antimicrobial activity per se when evaluated in brain heart infusion broth, the in vivo antibacterial activity seen in mice and rats reflects primarily the efficient hydrolysis of the ester to carbenicillin. with an acute systemic infection in mice as a test system, orally administered carbenicillin indanyl sodium protected mice against lethal infections produced by escherichia coli, salmonella choleraesuis, pasteurella multocida, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus  aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the dose that protected 50% of the animals against each of these infections was comparable to that of parenteral carbenicillin. against experimental urinary-tract disease in rats produced by e.  coli, p. vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was again observed that carbenicillin indanyl sodium provided activity comparable to that of parenterally administered carbenicillin.

AB  == 7-[alpha-(1-methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as bl-s 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. a comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that bl-s 217 is about eightfold more effective against streptococcus pyogenes and diplococcus pneumoniae. against gram-negative  bacteria, bl-s 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., bl-s 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both escherichia coli and klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against salmonella and enterobacter. overall, of 208 strains of enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to bl-s 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. bl-s 217 was less bound  to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. the ld(50) of bl-s 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. when administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in s. pyogenes and d. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an e. coli infection. its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis.

TI  == platelet interaction with bacteria. ii. fate of the bacteria.
AB  == several common strains of bacteria have been studied to determine their influence on human and rabbit platelets in vitro. bacteria at a nominal ratio of 1:1 were added to platelets in their native plasma or to platelets in a balanced salt solution. the platelet-bacterial interaction was examined by nephelometry and by  sequential light microscopy of fixed specimens taken at key points in the reaction. the results support the following conclusions: (1) bacteria that were potent stimuli of the platelet aggregation reaction were incorporated in large numbers into the forming platelet aggregates. (2) bacteria sequestered within platelet aggregates remained in direct contact with the aggregated platelet mass  for up to 1 hour in vitro and during this time showed no morphologic changes by light microscopy. (3) plateletbacterial interaction produced clumping of the bacteria but no demonstrable killing of the microorganisms. (4) collagen-platelet interaction resulted in release of platelet products that were capable of clumping bacteria but were not lethal to them. (5) rabbit and human platelets showed no species differences in plateletbacterial interaction. (6) washed platelets interacted with bacteria without added serum factors but the addition of serum accelerated the aggregation reaction.

TI  == platelet interaction with bacteria. i. reaction phases and effects of inhibitors.
AB  == interactions between human platelets and several common species of bacteria have  been studied in vitro by the technic of recording nephelometry. results of this investigation have established the following parameters of platelet-bacterial interaction: (1) bacteria are potent stimuli of the platelet-aggregating reaction. (2) the platelet-bacterial interaction proceeds through four distinct phases which are separable by varying the platelet-bacterial ratios or adding appropriate chemical inhibitors. (3) the degree and rate of the platelet response is proportional to the ratio of bacteria to platelets. (4) direct contact between platelets and bacteria, physiologic levels of divalent cations and nucleotide release from platelets are essential for aggregation of platelets by bacteria. (5) by adding equivalent numbers of six species of microorganisms to platelet-rich plasma, their potency as initiators of the platelet reaction was determined, with staphylococcus being the most powerful.

TI  == effects of intrarenal inoculation of staphylococcus aureus on mice.
AB  == the extreme susceptibility of the mouse kidney to infection with staphylococcus aureus was confirmed by direct intrarenal (i.r.) inoculation with this organism.  by applying poisson's distribution formula to the results from infection of mice  with small inocula (as few as one coccus or less per kidney), it was estimated that even three organisms could multiply in situ to produce abscess lesions, if the organisms were inoculated directly into the kidneys. this susceptibility of the mouse kidney for staphylococcal infection was not uniformly manifested with every strain, but correlated well with the virulence found through intravenous infection of the strains tested. the i.r. inoculation method by which infection of mice was easily established, using a small inoculum of s. aureus, similar to the amount suspected to occur in natural infections of man, is applicable for the analysis of the mechanisms of staphylococcal infections and any resulting immunity in man. the present paper describes the details and some experimental results obtained by our method.

AB  == concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. the in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. all strains of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. of the staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all s. aureus, 80% of escherichia coli, 72% of klebsiella-aerobacter, and 56% of proteus mirabilis strains. about 90 to 96% of e. coli, klebsiella aerobacter, and p. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. pseudomonas and indole-positive proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. a peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. a mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. food did not interfere with absorption. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. over 90% of the administered dose was excreted  in the urine within 6 hr. the mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group a streptococci, d. pneumoniae, and s. aureus, 85% of e. coli, and about 40 to 75% of klebsiella-aerobacter and p. mirabilis strains. levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of e. coli, and p. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of klebsiella-aerobacter strains.

TI  == demonstration of a bactericidal substance against beta-hemolytic streptococci in  supernatant fluids of staphylococcal cultures.
AB  == staphylococcal skin isolates belonging to phage type 71 were found to produce a bactericidal substance against some streptococci, pneumococci, and corynebacteria. fifteen strains of group a streptococci belonging to 13 different m types, group c streptococci, and group d streptococci were uniformly inhibited  on solid media and in broth by membrane-filtered supernatant fluids of the staphylococcal broth cultures. inhibition of group g streptococci and other staphyloccoci was variable, and no inhibition of group b streptococci or of a variety of gram-negative rods was demonstrable. a quantitative variation observed to exist among susceptible organisms was a function of the inoculum size of the inhibited strains. the bactericidal substance could be detected best from 24 to 48 hr after inoculation of the staphylococci in tryptic soy broth or in a dialysate of tryptic soy broth. little or no bactericidal activity was noted when the organisms were grown in several other liquid media. the bactericidal substance was nondialyzable and could be precipitated with ammonium sulfate. it was heat-stable and its activity was not altered within a ph range of 4.0 to 8.5. pronase and three times crystallized trypsin totally abolished its activity. the  concentrated ammonium sulfate precipitate could be fractionated on a sephadex g-100 column into several peaks, with the bactericidal activity localized to a single peak.

AB  == a long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group d streptococci that were examined, five strains of streptococcus faecalis, single strains of s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and s. durans, and three strains of streptococcus spp. in one strain of s. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. the core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. it resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the s. faecalis strains. cores were not present  in single strains of s. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group a), s. agalactiae (group b), s. dysgalactiae (group c), s. equisimilis (group c), and s. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus megaterium. cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group d streptococci. for preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.

AB  == serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus  strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were  inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were  more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.

TI  == role of the phagocyte in host-parasite interactions. xii. hydrogen peroxide-myeloperoxidase bactericidal system in the phagocyte.
AB  == an antimicrobial system in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) consisting of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide has been proposed. this system appears to be activated during phagocytosis as a result of the stimulated metabolic activities. a lysed-granules (lg) fraction was prepared from guinea pig exudative pmn. lg alone possessed bactericidal activity which was related to the ph of the  reaction; the lower the ph, the more marked the activity. when low concentrations of both h(2)o(2) and lg were combined under conditions where neither factor alone exhibited significant killing power, there was a striking increase in bactericidal activity. this enhanced activity was much greater than an additive effect. the lg-peroxide antibacterial system was most active over a ph range of 4.0 to 6.0. the activity of the lg-peroxide system was essentially abolished by peroxidase inhibitors, nan(3), kcn, and aminotriazole. the antibacterial activity of this system was nonspecific in nature, being equally effective against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.

TI  == modification of host responses to bacterial endotoxins. i. specificity of pyrogenic tolerance and the role of hypersensitivity in pyrogenicity, lethality,  and skin reactivity.
AB  == evidence is presented suggesting that the apparent non-specificity of pyrogenic tolerance observed with gram-negative bacterial endotoxins is due to related antigenic determinants associated with the macromolecular toxins. this is based on results obtained in rabbits from pyrogenic cross-tolerance tests with selected endotoxins. in these tests, purified endotoxins from escherichia coli (coo8) and  chromobacterium violaceum (cv) gave results one might expect with non-reciprocal  cross-reacting antigens in classical immune systems. additional evidence for an immune mechanism in tolerance is suggested by the highly significant anamnestic response observed. lipid a, a toxic derivative of the purified coo8 endotoxin, failed to induce pyrogenic tolerance against the parent toxin. these results are  explained by assuming that endotoxins have two interdependent activities associated with different portions of the macromolecule; one is assumed to be responsible for the primary toxicity, and the other is involved in secondary toxicity. the latter is dependent on the hypersensitive state of the host. additional evidence for the role of hypersensitivity in secondary toxicity is based on the observation that adult rabbits are highly sensitive to the pyrogenic, lethal, and skin-reacting activities of endotoxin in contrast to young animals which are more resistant to all of these attributes of toxicity. in adults, the host responses to pyrogenicity, lethality, and skin reactivity could  be partially inhibited by the early exposure of the animals to massive doses of endotoxin equivalent to a ld(50). the pyrogenic tolerance shown in these animals  was specific indicating that the inhibition of the hypersusceptibility to endotoxin involved an immunological mechanism. a mechanism of endotoxin tolerance is proposed and discussed based on the induction of specific antibodies capable of assisting the res in the clearance and destruction of endotoxin. it is suggested that the present inconsistencies relative to the chemical nature and biological activities of endotoxins might be explained on the basis of these two  activities and the failure to recognize the importance of the immunological state of the host in which the toxins are tested.

TI  == in vitro biological activity of cephalothin.
AB  == chang, te-wen (tufts university school of medicine, boston, mass.) and louis weinstein. in vitro biological activity of cephalothin. j. bacteriol. 85:1022-1027. 1963.-cephalothin is a "broad-spectrum" antibiotic active, in low concentrations, against diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. shigella, salmonella, and proteus mirabilis were the most  sensitive of the gram-negative organisms. escherichia coli and aerobacter aerogenes were suppressed to a lesser degree, whereas pseudomonas aeruginosa and  herellea were highly resistant. penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains of s. aureus were equally susceptible to cephalothin. exposure to increasing concentrations of the drug very frequently led to the development of resistance in gram-negative organisms; this was observed less often with s. aureus. cephalothin stimulated the production of penicillinase by staphylococci, which remained sensitive to the cephalosporanic acid derivatives despite repeated subculture in increasing concentrations of the agent. cephalothin was not inhibited by penicillinase. this antibiotic was more toxic to cultures of human amnion and mouse embryo cells than benzyl penicillin g but was less injurious than oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline; tetracylcine produced about the same degree of cellular damage as cephalothin.

TI  == survival of bacteria in lyophilized plasma.
AB  == although lyophilization reduces the bacterial population in plasma, some species  survive for several months. sensitivity or resistance to lyophilization in plasma is a characteristic of each morphological type, with gram-negative species being  more sensitive to destruction than cocci or sporulating gram-positive species. reconstituted preparations of lyophilized plasma must be incubated for 24 hr to prevent false-negative sterility tests. the killing process in lyophilized plasma continues with time if the preparations are stored at room temperature. strict asepsis must be realized during processing of plasma because lyophilization alone does not destroy the microorganisms present.

TI  == inhibition on bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid.
AB  == streightoff, frank (the lilly research laboratories, indianapolis, ind.). inhibition of bacteria by 5-fluoronicotinic acid and other analogues of nicotinic acid. j. bacteriol. 85:42-48. 1963.-several compounds related to 5-fluoronicotinic acid (5-fna) have been demonstrated to inhibit streptococcus sp. (viridans group), staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and lactobacillus  plantarum in vitro. the most active compounds were 5-fna and 5-fluoronicotinamide (5-fnam). the growth of streptococcus sp. was inhibited more than 50% by 0.05 mug/ml of 5-fna or 0.5 mug/ml of 5-fnam. the inhibition of streptococcus sp. from 1 part of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 4 and 2 parts of nicotinic acid, respectively. the inhibition of e. coli from 100 parts of 5-fna or 5-fnam was reversed by 1 part of nicotinic acid. inhibitions by most other active compounds  could be reversed by nicotinic acid. in experiments with mice, eight compounds related to 5-fna had activity against streptococcus pyogenes; 5-fna, 5-fnam, and  5-fluoro-n-dimethylaminomethylnicotinamide protected all mice at 83 mg/kg x two treatments subcutaneously. the action of 200 mg/kg x two treatments of 5-fna was  reversed by 20 mg/kg x two treatments of nicotinic acid. the activity of 5-fna was not increased by modifications at the number 3 or 5 positions on the pyridine ring or by any other structural changes.

TI  == the binding of penicillin in relation to its cytotoxic action. i. correlation between the penicillin sensitivity and combining activity of intact bacteria and  cell-free extracts.
AB  == 1. bacteria exposed to c(14)- or s(35)-labelled penicillin bound and concentrated the antibiotic. the amount bound from low concentrations (0.001 to 0.01 microg. per ml.) was related to the penicillin sensitivity of the strain; and highly sensitive organisms such as streptococcus pyogenes concentrated the antibiotic as much as 200-fold. the material bound by highly sensitive strains from these low concentrations of penicillin was removed to only a minor extent by washing. penicillin inactivated with penicillinase, by hot h(2)so(4) or by cold hcl was not similarly concentrated. 2. despite wide differences in their sensitivity to penicillin, at equieffective (ld(99.9)) levels, four of the five strains here studied had bound comparable amounts of antibiotic. that lethal intracellular concentration averaged 1.7 to 4 microg. per gm., and 1600 to 3300 molecules per cell. 3. bacteria in the logarithmic phase of growth, "resting" organisms, and cell-free sonic extracts, had roughly the same reactivity with penicillin. the differences in the amount of penicillin bound by bacteria of varying sensitivity  therefore do not rest on differences in the permeability of the cell. 4. escherichia coli (k12)-inactivated penicillin within the cell; and that inactivation adequately explains its low binding affinity, and its relative resistance. the other species here studied inactivated the diffusible cellular penicillin to only a minor degree, and not enough to explain the differences in their penicillin-sensitivity. the working hypothesis is suggested that their varying sensitivity is instead determined by differences in the reactivity of vital cell components with the antibiotic. 5. at high concentrations of antibiotic (1 to 1000 microg. per ml.), there was non-specific binding by all the cell strains and cell extracts here studied, unrelated to their sensitivity, and  masking the specific differences in reactivity noted at low concentrations. at these high levels, penicilloic acid was bound to the same degree as the active antibiotic.
