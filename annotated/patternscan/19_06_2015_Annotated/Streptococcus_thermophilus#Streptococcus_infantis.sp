TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == probiotic effects on late-onset sepsis in very preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background and objective: late-onset sepsis frequently complicates prematurity, contributing to morbidity and mortality. probiotics may reduce mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in preterm infants, with unclear effect on late-onset sepsis. this study aimed to determine the effect of administering a specific combination of probiotics to very preterm infants on culture-proven late-onset sepsis. methods: a prospective multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial compared daily administration of a probiotic combination (bifidobacterium infantis, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium lactis, containing 1 x 10(9) total organisms) with placebo (maltodextrin) in infants born before 32 completed weeks' gestation weighing <1500 g. the primary outcome was at least 1 episode of definite late-onset sepsis. results: between october 2007 and november 2011, 1099 very preterm infants from australia and new zealand were randomized. rates of definite late-onset sepsis (16.2%), nec of bell stage 2 or more (4.4%), and mortality (5.1%) were low in controls, with high breast milk feeding rates (96.9%). no significant difference in definite late-onset sepsis or all-cause mortality was found, but this probiotic combination reduced nec of bell stage 2 or more (2.0% versus 4.4%; relative risk 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.93, p = .03; number needed to treat 43, 95% confidence interval 23 to 333). conclusions: the probiotics b infantis, s thermophilus, and b lactis significantly reduced nec of  bell stage 2 or more in very preterm infants, but not definite late-onset sepsis  or mortality. treatment with this combination of probiotics appears to be safe.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: an 8-year retrospective cohort study.
AB  == what is known and objective: probiotic therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in premature infants in several  international studies using various probiotic agents. the purpose of this study(*) is to describe our experience of using probiotic therapy in preventing nec in infants with very low birth weight (vlbw) in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and to evaluate whether our records provide evidence of effectiveness for probiotic therapy. methods: in a retrospective cohort study, the efficacy of  probiotic therapy in preventing nec in vlbw infants was investigated via chart review. a probiotic administration protocol using a three-strain (streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium bifidum) supplement was implemented in august 2007. patients admitted to the nicu from august 2003 through july 2011 were screened. primary outcomes are the morbidity and mortality of nec. the secondary outcomes were severity of nec and incidence of where infant feeds were stopped but nec was not diagnosed (nec scare). results and discussion: there was a significant increased baseline risk of nec development in the probiotics group, including younger gestational age, higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (pda) and use of indomethacin. the incidence of nec is similar  between the control group (2.8%) and probiotics group (2.4%) (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.42, 3.12). mortality of nec is also not statistically different. incidence of nec scare was decreased from 2.8% in control group to 1.4% in probiotics group, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.38). what is known and conclusion: our findings  suggest that probiotics are safe in nec prevention in vlbw infants. we had no cases of infection related to the strains of bacteria used in our product. with the low incidence of nec (2.8%) and nec scare (2.8%) in our cohort, we do not have enough power to detect any change in outcome, particularly as our study was  observational. however, it is hoped that our data give useful information for others on probiotic prophylactic therapy in the routine clinical management of vlbw infants.

TI  == rapid assay to assess colonization patterns following in-vivo probiotic ingestion.
AB  == background: colonization of the intestine with some microorganisms has been shown to have beneficial health effects. the association of bacteria with its human host starts soon after birth; however in infants born prematurely establishment of normal intestinal flora is interrupted with colonization with potential pathogenic organisms probiotic supplementation may therefore be beneficial to the health of preterm infants. as most probiotic organisms are difficult to culture,  confirmation of their colonization after supplementation is difficult. in this study, rapid qpcr assays for detection of presence of probiotic species in the intestine by faecal sampling is described in both preterm infant and adult participants. findings: probiotic colonization was determined using qpcr directed at amplification of organisms present in the ingested probiotic streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. infantis. overall, differential detection of probiotic strains in faeces were found between adult and preterm infants, with 50% of infants continuing to shed at least two probiotic strains three weeks after probiotic ingestion had ceased.  conclusions: this study demonstrated rapid assessment of the preterm infant gut for colonization with probiotic strains using real-time pcr. this method would be of great importance in studies of probiotics in prevention of diseases and adverse clinical outcomes.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == effect of lactic fermentation on the total phenolic, saponin and phytic acid contents as well as anti-colon cancer cell proliferation activity of soymilk.
AB  == in an attempt to develop healthy dietary adjuncts, soymilk was fermented simultaneously with streptococcus thermophilus 14085 and bifidobacterium infantis 14603 at 37 degrees c for 24 h. it was found that lactic fermentation reduced the content of saponins and phytates, which possess antinutritional activity, and enhanced the total phenolic content as well as antitumor cell proliferation effect of soymilk against ht-29 and caco-2 cells. the original antitumor cell component, starter organisms, and antitumor cell bioactive principles formed in soymilk during fermentation, might all have contributed to the enhanced antitumor activity of fermented soymilk. the antiproliferative effect of the extracts varied with extraction solvent. extracts obtained from fermented soymilk with 80% methanol exhibited the highest suppression effect on the proliferation of ht-29 and caco-2 cells. this study further stresses the potential of developing soymilk as a healthy dietary adjunct possessing enhanced anticancer activity through the  use of lactic fermentation.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == the proprems trial: investigating the effects of probiotics on late onset sepsis  in very preterm infants.
AB  == background: late onset sepsis is a frequent complication of prematurity associated with increased mortality and morbidity. the commensal bacteria of the  gastrointestinal tract play a key role in the development of healthy immune responses. healthy term infants acquire these commensal organisms rapidly after birth. however, colonisation in preterm infants is adversely affected by delivery mode, antibiotic treatment and the intensive care environment. altered microbiota composition may lead to increased colonisation with pathogenic bacteria, poor immune development and susceptibility to sepsis in the preterm infant.probiotics  are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host. amongst numerous bacteriocidal and nutritional roles, they may also favourably modulate host immune responses in local and remote tissues. meta-analyses of probiotic supplementation in preterm infants report a reduction in mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. studies with sepsis as an outcome have reported mixed results to date.allergic diseases are increasing in incidence in "westernised" countries. there is evidence that probiotics may reduce the incidence of these diseases by altering the intestinal  microbiota to influence immune function. methods/design: this is a multi-centre,  randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial investigating supplementing  preterm infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation weighing < 1500 g, with a probiotic combination (bifidobacterium infantis, streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium lactis). a total of 1,100 subjects are being recruited in australia and new zealand. infants commence the allocated intervention from soon  after the start of feeds until discharge home or term corrected age. the primary  outcome is the incidence of at least one episode of definite (blood culture positive) late onset sepsis before 40 weeks corrected age or discharge home. secondary outcomes include: necrotising enterocolitis, mortality, antibiotic usage, time to establish full enteral feeds, duration of hospital stay, growth measurements at 6 and 12 months' corrected age and evidence of atopic conditions  at 12 months' corrected age. discussion: results from previous studies on the use of probiotics to prevent diseases in preterm infants are promising. however, a large clinical trial is required to address outstanding issues regarding safety and efficacy in this vulnerable population. this study will address these important issues. trial registration: australia and new zealand clinical trials register (anzctr): actrn012607000144415the product "abc dophilus probiotic powder for infants(r)", solgar, usa has its 3 probiotics strains registered with the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen (dsmz--german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures) as bb-12 15954, b-02 96579, th-4 15957.

TI  == effect of functional yogurt ny-yp901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  == background/objectives: this study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt ny-yp901 (namyang dairy product co. ltd and nutra r&bt inc., seoul, korea) supplemented with mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing bifidobacterium breve (cbg-c2), enterococcus faecalis fk-23, fibersol-2 and so on. subjects/methods: this study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt ny-yp901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. body weight and body mass  index (bmi), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with hba1c and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. results: during the period august 2009 to december 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. in the treatment group consuming ny-yp901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, p<0.05), bmi (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), p<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, p<0.05) after 8 weeks. the change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. conclusions: the functional yogurt ny-yp901 reduced ldl-cholesterol, body weight and bmi in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. from these findings, regular intake of functional  yogurt ny-yp901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.

TI  == probiotic fermented milk containing dietary fiber has additive effects in ibs with constipation compared to plain probiotic fermented milk.
AB  == background/aims: although controversial, probiotics and dietary fiber are commonly used for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). we evaluated the  effects of multistrain probiotics on the symptoms of ibs to determine whether the addition of dietary fi ber had an additive effect on constipation-predominant ibs. methods: a total of 142 participants who met the rome iii criteria were recruited and randomized into a control group or a test group. participants in the control group received multistrain probiotic fermented milk with streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis; the participants in the test group received the same probiotic fermented milk mixed with dietary fi ber such as sea tangle extracts, radish extracts and glasswort extracts. the patients were treated for four weeks. results: most of the symptoms of ibs, with the exception of fl atulence, stool consistency, and frequency of defecation, signifi cantly improved in both groups. in the analysis of ibs subtypes, especially constipation-predominant ibs, the frequency and duration of defecation and straining at stool were improved more in the test group than in the control group. conclusions: dietary fiber had additive benefits for the symptoms of constipation, especially in constipation-predominant ibs.

TI  == possible mechanisms of antimutagenicity in fermented soymilk prepared with a coculture of streptococcus infantis and bifidobacterium infantis.
AB  == the possible mechanisms of antimutagenicity against 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo; a direct mutagen) and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab; an indirect mutagen) were examined in fermented soymilk prepared with a coculture of streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium infantis. the antimutagenicity in  the fermented soymilk was not due to the bioantimutagenic effect of modulation of dna repair processes. the mutagenicity of dmab decreased with increased preincubation of fermented soymilk and the dmab metabolite but not with intact dmab or an s9 mixture. mutagenicity of 4-nqo was not affected by preincubation of fermented soymilk with this mutagen. mutagenicity of both 4-nqo and dmab was reduced when salmonella typhimurium ta 100 was pretreated with fermented soymilk, indicating that fermented soymilk affected the function of the bacterial cell, which might also lead to reduced mutagenicity of the tested mutagens. desmutagenic and blocking effects were the main mechanisms of antimutagenicity in the fermented soymilk against dmba. in contrast, the antimutagenic effect of the  fermented soymilk on 4-nqo was primarily due to a blocking effect.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == transformation of isoflavone phytoestrogens during the fermentation of soymilk with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in the present study, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus bcrc 14085, lactobacillus acidophilus bcrc 14079) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis bcrc 14633, b. longum b6) individually,  and in combination. the change in the content of various isoflavones (aglycones,  glucoside, acetyl- and malonyl-glucosides) and the beta-glucosidase activity in soymilk during fermentation is investigated. it is observed that fermented soymilk contains a lower total isoflavone content (81.94-86.61 microg/ml) than soymilk without fermentation (87.61 microg/ml). regardless of starter organism employed, fermentation causes a major reduction in the contents of glucoside, malonylglucoside and acetylglucoside isoflavones along with a significant increase of aglycone isoflavones content. the level of change in the content of various isoflavones and beta-glucosidase activity after fermentation varies with  the starter organism. among all the fermented soymilks tested, soymilk fermented  with s. thermophilus showed the highest beta-glucosidase activity and the greatest increase in the contents of aglycones. the percentage of daidzein, genistein and glycitein to total isoflavone content in s. thermophilus-fermented  soymilk increases from an initial 14.24%, 6.89% and 2.45%, respectively, to 36.20%, 28.80% and 12.44% after 24h of fermentation. finally, the increase of aglycones and decrease of glucoside isoflavones during fermentation coincides with the increase of beta-glucosidase activity observed in fermented soymilk.

TI  == antioxidative activities of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to further the goal of developing a probiotic dietary adjunct using soymilk, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus ccrc 14079 or streptococcus thermophilus ccrc 14085) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis ccrc 14633 or bifidobacterium longum b6) individually,  and in conjunction. we investigate several antioxidative activities including the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, the scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and the reducing activity exerted by different varieties of fermented soymilks. in addition, the effect of spray-drying and freeze-drying on changes in antioxidative activity is examined. we find that in fermented soymilk both the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, and the reducing activity and scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals varied with the starters used, but nevertheless are significantly higher than those found in unfermented soymilk. in general, antioxidative activity in soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria simultaneously is significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that fermented with either individually. moreover, antioxidative activity increases as the fermentation period is extended. however, unfermented soymilk shows an h2o2-scavenging effect, while there is no scavenging effect except for the accumulation of h2o2 in fermented soymilk. finally, we find that freeze-drying causes a significantly lesser (p < 0.05) reduction in the antioxidative activity of soymilk than does spray-drying. irrespective of the drying method and the starters used for fermentation. the antioxidative activity  of fermented soymilk reduces after drying yet remains higher than that of dried unfermented soymilk.

TI  == mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab), an indirect-acting mutagen, on salmonella typhimurium ta 100, was then investigated. it was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on sal. typhimurium ta 100. fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. the levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo. among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both str. themophilus and b. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-nqo and dmab further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against dmab, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-nqo.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

AB  == objective: to test the hypothesis that normalizing the intestinal flora by administration of prophylactic probiotics would provide a natural defense, thereby reducing both the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in preterm neonates. study design: neonates < or =1500 g birth weight were  randomized to either receive a daily feeding supplementation with a probiotic mixture (bifidobacteria infantis, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacteria  bifidus; solgar, israel) of 10(9) colony forming units (cfu)/day or to not receive feed supplements. nec was graded according to bell's criteria. results: for 72 study and 73 control infants, respectively, birth weight (1152 +/- 262 g vs 1111 +/- 278 g), gestational age (30 +/- 3 weeks vs 29 +/- 4 weeks), and time  to reach full feeds (14.6 +/- 8.7 days vs 17.5 +/- 13.6 days) were not different. the incidence of nec was reduced in the study group (4% vs 16.4%; p=.03). nec was less severe in the probiotic-supplemented infants (bell's criteria 2.3 +/- 0.5 vs 1.3 +/- 0.5; p=.005). three of 15 babies who developed nec died, and all nec-related deaths occurred in control infants. conclusion: probiotic supplementation reduced both the incidence and severity of nec in our premature neonatal population.

TI  == in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of lactobacilli isolated from commercial products containing active lactobacilli.
AB  == to survey the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of some commercially available lactobacillus, we collected four commercial products that contain active lactobacillus. we incubated individual product and identified these colonies by the methods of api50 ch test kit and rapid id 32a kit. strains of streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei were collected. by agar dilution method, each identified strain was inoculated to brucella blood agar-mic plates. each plate contained one of the following antibiotics with different concentrations: amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, vancomycin, erythromycin, rifampin, tetracyclin and penicillin g, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, cefmetazole, metronidazole, ampicillin/sulbactum, cefoxtin, etc. after incubation, the growth condition of each brucella blood agar-mic plate was observed and the breakpoint of each antibiotic to different lactobacillus products determined. the mics of amoxicillin, ampicillin/sulbactum and penicillin-g to all identified strains were < or =2 microg/ml and those of vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, cefmetazole and cefoxtin for l. casei were >32 microg/ml. l. casei was more resistant to all the testing antibiotics than the other strains. according to the mics of the above antibiotics, proper active lactobacillus products could be chosen to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the pediatric field.

TI  == viability of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in fermented soymilk after drying, subsequent rehydration and storage.
AB  == to develop a probiotic dietary adjunct, soymilk fermented with various combinations of lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium infantis) was subjected to freeze-drying and spray-drying. survival of the starter organisms during the drying process, subsequent rehydration at different temperatures and during a 4-month period of storage under different storage conditions was examined. after freeze-drying, lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria exhibited a survival percent of 46.2-75.1% and 43.2-51.9%, respectively, higher than that noted after spray-drying. regardless of the drying condition, s. thermophilus showed a higher percentage of survival than l. acidophilus, while b. longum survived better than b. infantis. further study with soymilk fermented with s. thermophilus and b. longum revealed that the freeze-dried and spray-dried fermented soymilk rehydrated at 35-50 degrees c and  20 degrees c, respectively, was optimum for the recovery of the starter organisms. both s. thermophilus and b. longum survived better in the freeze-dried than the spray-dried fermented soymilk during storage. a higher percent of survival was also noted for both the starter organisms when the dried fermented soymilk was stored at 4 degrees c than 25 degrees c. holding the dried fermented  soymilk in the laminated pouch enabled s. thermophilus and b. longum to exhibit a higher percentage of survival than in the deoxidant- and desiccant-containing glass or polyester (pet) bottle. among all the packaging materials and storage temperatures tested, starter organisms were most stable in the dried fermented soymilk held in laminated pouch and stored at 4 degrees c. under this storage condition, s. thermophilus and b. longum showed a survival percentage of 51.1% and 68.8%, respectively, in the freeze-dried fermented soymilk after 4 months of  storage. meanwhile, s. thermophilus and b. infantis in the spray-dried fermented  soymilk showed a survival percent of 29.5% and 57.7%, respectively.

TI  == [evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and  lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448).  in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over  the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI  == pcr detection of bifidobacterium strains and streptococcus thermophilus in feces  of human subjects after oral bacteriotherapy and yogurt consumption.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis y1 and bifidobacterium breve y8 strains were identified and enumerated by pcr assay in human fecal samples after intake of the pharmaceutical preparation vsl-3 or yogurt. thi/thii primer set, specific for s. thermophilus, was selected testing its specificity against several strains of enterococci, streptococci and other genera colonizing the human intestine. a culture-independent pcr protocol, developed in this study, allowed to directly detect and enumerate s. thermophilus in human feces, excluding culture-based techniques or time consuming dna isolation and purification procedures. intestinal persistence of s. thermophilus was studied in feces of 10 healthy subjects given vsl-3 or yogurt. streptococcal population was  detected after 3 days of administration and persisted for 6 days after the treatment suspension. in the same trial, the colonization kinetics of b. infantis y1 and b. breve y8 were studied by amplification of colonies with the strain-specific primer sets infy-bv.l/r and brey-bv.r/l, showing a host-dependent transient colonization behaviour. pcr analysis of feces from 10 patients affected by inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) and treated with vsl-3 for 2 months showed a colonization pattern of s. thermophilus, b. infantis y1 and b. breve y8 similar to that observed with the healthy subjects.

TI  == effects of probiotic administration upon the composition and enzymatic activity of human fecal microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea.
AB  == in a clinical trial, 10 patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea were administered the probiotic preparation vsl-3. preliminary results indicated that administration of vsl-3 improved the clinical  picture and changed the composition and biochemistry of fecal microbiota. titer variations of intestinal bacterial groups were evaluated by culture and pcr techniques. a significant increase in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococcus thermophilus was observed as a consequence of probiotic treatment,  while enterococci, coliforms, bacteroides and clostridium perfringens did not change significantly. the strains bifidobacterium infantis y1 and bifidobacterium breve y8, included in vsl-3, were specifically detected in feces of patients treated with the probiotic by using strain-specific pcr primers. in addition, fecal beta-galactosidase increased and urease activities decreased as a result of changes in the intestinal microbiota induced by vsl-3 administration.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == ingestion of yogurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium to potentiate immunoglobulin a responses to cholera toxin in mice.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. to determine whether  these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. mice that were  immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (ig)a anti-cholera toxin. antibody responses of the iga  isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and bifidobacterium infantis. yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced  less iga anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. although strong responses were also observed for igg anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic iga responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
