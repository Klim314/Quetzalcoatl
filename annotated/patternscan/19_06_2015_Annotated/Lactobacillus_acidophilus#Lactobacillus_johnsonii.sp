TI  == characterization of the most abundant lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  == the count and diffusion of lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (gi) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six l. reuteri species isolated from broilers' gi tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. lactobacilli had the highest diversity  in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. compared with the lower gi tract, more lactobacilli were found in the upper gi tract. lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. aviarius were the  predominant lactobacillus species and present throughout the gi tract of chickens. lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant lactobacillus species. lactobacillus reuteri xc1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.

TI  == anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  == a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal  microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == h(2)o(2) production in species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group: a central  role for a novel nadh-dependent flavin reductase.
AB  == hydrogen peroxide production is a well-known trait of many bacterial species associated with the human body. in the presence of oxygen, the probiotic lactic acid bacterium lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533 excretes up to 1 mm h(2)o(2), inducing growth stagnation and cell death. disruption of genes commonly assumed to be involved in h(2)o(2) production (e.g., pyruvate oxidase, nadh oxidase, and  lactate oxidase) did not affect this. here we describe the purification of a novel nadh-dependent flavin reductase encoded by two highly similar genes (lj_0548 and lj_0549) that are conserved in lactobacilli belonging to the lactobacillus acidophilus group. the genes are predicted to encode two 20-kda proteins containing flavin mononucleotide (fmn) reductase conserved domains. reductase activity requires fmn, flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad), or riboflavin and is specific for nadh and not nadph. the km for fmn is 30 +/- 8 mum, in accordance with its proposed in vivo role in h(2)o(2) production. deletion of the encoding genes in l. johnsonii led to a 40-fold reduction of hydrogen peroxide formation. h(2)o(2) production in this mutant could only be restored by in trans  complementation of both genes. our work identifies a novel, conserved nadh-dependent flavin reductase that is prominently involved in h(2)o(2) production in l. johnsonii.

TI  == development of a tiered multilocus sequence typing scheme for members of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex.
AB  == members of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex are associated with functional foods and dietary supplements because of purported health benefits they impart to the consumer. many characteristics of these microorganisms are reported to be strain specific. therefore, proper strain typing is essential for safety assessment and product labeling, and also for monitoring strain integrity for industrial production purposes. fifty-two strains of the l. acidophilus complex (l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus, l. gallinarum, l. gasseri, and l. johnsonii) were genotyped using two established methods and compared to a novel multilocus sequence typing (mlst) scheme. pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analysis of the hsp60 gene with alui and taqi successfully clustered 51 of the 52 strains into the six species examined, but it lacked strain-level discrimination. random amplified polymorphic dna pcr (rapd-pcr) targeting the m13 sequence resulted in highly discriminatory profiles  but lacked reproducibility. in this study, an mlst scheme was developed using the conserved housekeeping genes fusa, gpma, gyra, gyrb, lepa, pyrg, and reca, which  identified 40 sequence types that successfully clustered all of the strains into  the six species. analysis of the observed alleles suggests that nucleotide substitutions within five of the seven mlst loci have reached saturation, a finding that emphasizes the highly diverse nature of the l. acidophilus complex and our unconventional application of a typically intraspecies molecular typing tool. our mlst results indicate that this method could be useful for characterization and strain discrimination of a multispecies complex, with the potential for taxonomic expansion to a broader collection of lactobacillus species.

TI  == eradication of helicobacter pylori infection by the probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii mh-68 and l. salivarius ssp. salicinius ap-32.
AB  == background: the current therapy for helicobacter pylori infection includes antimicrobial agents and proton pump inhibitors. we have examined the ability of  lactobacillus spp. to inhibit h. pylori infection. materials and methods: probiotic strains isolated from samples of adult feces, infant feces, breast milk, and vaginal swab collected from healthy volunteers in taiwan and commercially available strains were screened for antagonism toward h. pylori. inhibition liquid culture assay was used to screen potential anti-h. pylori activity. then, we performed agar plate inhibition assay, and assays to determine the capacity of probiotics for adhesion, and inhibition and killing of h. pylori, and measured the levels of il-8 and il-10. using animal models, we studied regulation of gastric acid and histopathological changes accompanying anti-h. pylori activity. results: we found that six of the tested strains suppressed urease activity of h. pylori: lactobacillus acidophilus tyca08, l. acidophilus tyca15, l. johnsonii mh-68, and l. salivarius subsp. salicinius ap-32 were more effective than the others. in vivo, l. johnsonii mh-68 and l. salivarius subsp. salicinius ap-32 alone or in combination, reduced the h. pylori load in the gastric mucosa, and also reduced inflammatory chemokine expression and lymphocyte infiltration. conclusions: lactobacillus johnsonii mh-68 and l. salivarius subsp. salicinius ap-32 effectively suppress h. pylori viability, and when used as probiotics, they may help decrease the occurrence of gastritis, and even reduce the risk of h. pylori infection.

TI  == restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
AB  == the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time  the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final  stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis  and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3,  cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor,  quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or  species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.

TI  == improved bioavailability of dietary phenolic acids in whole grain barley and oat  groat following fermentation with probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus , lactobacillus johnsonii , and lactobacillus reuteri.
AB  == the aim of this study was to improve the bioavailability of the dietary phenolic  acids in flours from whole grain barley and oat groat following fermentation with lactic acid bacteria (lab) exhibiting high feruloyl esterase activity (fae). the  highest increase of free phenolic acids was observed after fermentation with three probiotic strains, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, lactobacillus reuteri sd2112, and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, with maximum increases from 2.55 to 69.91 mug g(-1) dm and from 4.13 to 109.42 mug g(-1) dm in whole grain barley and oat groat, respectively. interestingly, higher amounts of bound phenolic acids were detected after both water treatment and lab fermentation in whole grain barley, indicating higher bioaccessibility, whereas some decrease was detected in oat groat. to conclude, cereal fermentation with specific probiotic strains can lead to significant increase of free phenolic acids, thereby improving their bioavailability.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == survival of probiotic lactobacilli in the upper gastrointestinal tract using an in vitro gastric model of digestion.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate survival of three commercial probiotic strains (lactobacillus casei subsp. shirota, l. casei subsp. immunitas, lactobacillus acidophilus subsp. johnsonii) in the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract using a dynamic gastric model (dgm) of digestion followed by incubation under duodenal conditions. water and milk were used as food matrices and survival was evaluated in both logarithmic and stationary phase. the % of recovery in logarithmic phase ranged from 1.0% to 43.8% in water for all tested strains, and from 80.5% to 197% in milk. higher survival was observed in stationary phase for all strains. l. acidophilus subsp. johnsonii showed the highest survival rate in both water (93.9%) and milk (202.4%). lactic acid production was higher in stationary phase, l. casei subsp. shirota producing the  highest concentration (98.2 mm) after in vitro gastric plus duodenal digestion.

TI  == group-specific comparison of four lactobacilli isolated from human sources using  differential blast analysis.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) have been used in fermentation processes for centuries. more recent applications including the use of lab as probiotics have significantly increased industrial interest. here we present a comparative genomic analysis of four completely sequenced lactobacillus strains, isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract, versus 25 lactic acid bacterial genomes present in the public database at the time of analysis. lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533, lactobacillus gasseri atcc33323, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1are all considered probiotic and widely used in industrial applications. using differential blast analysis (dba), each genome was compared to the respective remaining three other lactobacillus and 25 other lab genomes. dba highlighted strain-specific genes that were not represented in any other lab used in this analysis and also identified group-specific genes shared within lactobacilli. initial comparative analyses highlighted a significant number of genes involved in cell adhesion, stress responses, dna repair and modification, and metabolic capabilities. furthermore, the range of the recently  identified potential autonomous units (paus) was broadened significantly, indicating the possibility of distinct families within this genetic element. based on in silico results obtained for the model organism l. acidophilus ncfm, dba proved to be a valuable tool to identify new key genetic regions for functional genomics and also suggested re-classification of previously annotated  genes.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == dying in yoghurt: the number of living bacteria in probiotic yoghurt decreases under exposure to room temperature.
AB  == background/aims: while probiotic bacteria are successfully used in the treatment  of ulcerative colitis, the effect of commercially available probiotic products is still controversial. here, we study whether the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurts is altered by an interruption of the cold chain. methods: three commonly available probiotic yoghurts were kept at 4 degrees c or put at room temperature (rt) for 6 h or 24 h. an aliquot of each yoghurt was applied on  man-rogosa-sharpe agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. colony forming units (cfu) were counted by microscopy. results: the first yoghurt, containing lactobacillus johnsonii, showed a significant decrease in cfu after 6 h of storage at rt, which was further pronounced after 24 h. the number of cfu of the  second yoghurt, containing lactobacillus gg, was also decreased after 6 h and further diminished after 24 h at rt. from the third yoghurt, containing lactobacillus acidophilus, only 53.8% of the cfu remained after 6 h at rt; after  24 h, only about one fourth of the cfu were found. conclusions: our data demonstrate that the number of living probiotic bacteria in yoghurt products decreases dramatically after exposure to rt. this represents an important information for consumers of such products.

TI  == metabolites produced by probiotic lactobacilli rapidly increase glucose uptake by caco-2 cells.
AB  == background: although probiotic bacteria and their metabolites alter enterocyte gene expression, rapid, non-genomic responses have not been examined. the present study measured accumulation of tracer (2 microm) glucose by caco-2 cells after exposure for 10 min or less to a chemically defined medium (cdm) with different monosaccharides before and after anaerobic culture of probiotic lactobacilli. results: growth of l. acidophilus was supported by cdm with 110 mm glucose, fructose, and mannose, but not with arabinose, ribose, and xylose or the sugar-free cdm. glucose accumulation was reduced when caco-2 cells were exposed for 10 min to sterile cdm with glucose (by 92%), mannose (by 90%), fructose (by 55%), and ribose (by 16%), but not with arabinose and xylose. exposure of caco-2  cells for 10 min to bacteria-free supernatants prepared after exponential (48 h)  and stationary (72 h) growth phases of l. acidophilus cultured in cdm with 110 mm fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83% and 45%, respectively; exposure to a suspension of the bacteria had no effect. the increase in glucose accumulation  was diminished by heat-denaturing the supernatant, indicating the response of caco-2 cells is triggered by as yet unknown heat labile bacterial metabolites, not by a reduction in cdm components that decrease glucose uptake. supernatants prepared after anaerobic culture of l. gasseri, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum, and l. johnsonii in the cdm with fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83%, 32%, 27%, and 14%, respectively. conclusion: the rapid, non-genomic upregulation of sglt1 by bacterial metabolites is a heretofore unrecognized interaction between probiotics and the intestinal epithelium.

TI  == vaginal lactobacilli as potential probiotics against candida spp.
AB  == urogenital infections affect millions of people every year worldwide. the treatment of these diseases usually requires the use of antimicrobial agents, and more recently, the use of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures for the management of vaginal infections has been extensively studied. in this work, 11 vaginal lactobacilli isolates, previously obtained from healthy patients, were studied to screen microorganisms with probiotic properties against candida spp. the lab were tested for their ability of auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with c. albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, and c. tropicalis, adhesion to caco-2 epithelial cells and production of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2). all  lactobacilli isolates tested were able to auto-aggregate (ranging from 25.3% to 75.4% assessed at 4 hours of incubation) and to co-aggregate with the four candida species into different degrees; among them l. crispatus showed the highest scores of co-aggregation. the highest amount of lactic acid was produced  by l. salivarius (13.9 g/l), followed by l. johnsonii (6.5 g/l), l. acidophilus (5.5 g/l), and l. jensenii (5.4 g/l). all isolates produced h2o2, but the highest levels (3 - 10 mg/l) were observed for l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri,  l. johnsonii, and l. vaginalis. only l. agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii and l.  ruminus were able to adhere to epithelial caco-2 cells. among the isolates evaluated, l agilis, l. jensenii, l. johnsonii, and l. ruminus exhibited simultaneously several desirable properties as potential probiotic strains justifying future studies to evaluate their technological properties in different pharmaceutical preparations for human use.

TI  == functional and probiotic attributes of an indigenous isolate of lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  == background: probiotic microorganisms favorably alter the intestinal microflora balance, promote intestinal integrity and mobility, inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and increase resistance to infection. probiotics are increasingly used in nutraceuticals, functional foods or in microbial interference treatment. however, the effectiveness of probiotic organism is considered to be population-specific due to variation in gut microflora, food habits and specific  host-microbial interactions. most of the probiotic strains available in the market are of western or european origin, and a strong need for exploring new indigenous probiotic organisms is felt. methods and findings: an indigenous isolate lp9 identified as lactobacillus plantarum by molecular-typing methods was studied extensively for its functional and probiotic attributes, viz., acid and bile salt tolerance, cell surface hydrophobicity, autoaggregation and caco-2 cell-binding as well as antibacterial and antioxidative activities. lp9 isolate could survive 2 h incubation at ph 1.5-2.0 and toxicity of 1.5-2.0% oxgall bile.  lp9 could deconjugate major bile salts like glycocholate and deoxytaurocholate, indicating its potential to cause hypocholesterolemia. the isolate exhibited cell-surface hydrophobicity of approximately 37% and autoaggregation of approximately 31%. presence of putative probiotic marker genes like mucus-binding protein (mub), fibronectin-binding protein (fbp) and bile salt hydrolase (bsh) were confirmed by pcr. presence of these genes suggested the possibility of specific interaction and colonization potential of lp9 isolate in the gut, which  was also suggested by a good adhesion ratio of 7.4+/-1.3% with caco-2 cell line.  the isolate demonstrated higher free radical scavenging activity than standard probiotics l. johnsonii la1 and l. acidophilus la7. lp9 also exhibited antibacterial activity against e. coli, l. monocytogenes, s. typhi, s. aureus and b. cereus. conclusion: the indigenous lactobacillus plantarum lp9 exhibited high  resistance against low ph and bile and possessed antibacterial, antioxidative and cholesterol lowering properties with a potential for exploitation in the development of indigenous functional food or nutraceuticals.

TI  == ai-2 signalling is induced by acidic shock in probiotic strains of lactobacillus  spp.
AB  == survival and ability to respond to various environmental stresses such as low ph  are important factors for lactobacilli for their function as probiotics. luxs-mediated quorum sensing mechanism, which is based on the production of universal signal molecule called autoinducer-2 (ai-2), regulates important physiological traits and a variety of adaptive processes in different bacteria. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acidic stress on luxs-mediated quorum sensing (ai-2 signalling) in four probiotic strains of different lactobacillus species. initially, the production of ai-2-like molecule  was investigated in four strains of lactobacillus spp. at standard growth conditions using vibrio harveyi bioluminescence assay. species variation in ai-2  activity was observed. ai-2 activity started at early-exponential growth phase and increased during the mid-exponential phase concomitant with the reduction of  ph, reaching maximum at late exponential phase (l. rhamnosus gg) or at stationary phase (l. salivarius ucc118, l. acidophilus ncfm and l. johnsonii ncc533). acidic shock experiments were conducted on l. rhamnosus gg and l. acidophilus ncfm after exposure to different acidic shocks (ph 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0) and to ph 6.5 as control, measuring ai-2 activity and transcription of the luxs gene. ai-2 activity increased by lowering the ph in a dose dependent manner and was negatively influenced by acid adaptation. in both species, the luxs gene was repressed after exposure to ph 6.5 as control. however, after acidic shock (ph 4.0) a transient response of luxs gene was observed and the transcription augmented over time, reaching a maximum level and decreased subsequently. acid adaptation of cells attenuated the transcription of this gene. based on the observations done in the present study, the luxs gene appears to have a clear role in acidic stress response in probiotic lactobacilli. this might be important in the survival of these bacteria during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract, and further influence the cell-to-cell communication among bacteria in the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov., isolated from silage.
AB  == strain firdi 006t, isolated from silage cattle feed, was characterized by using phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. the strain was a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium; the cells stained gram-positive and were catalase-negative, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic rods. 16s rrna gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain belongs phylogenetically to the genus  lactobacillus and can be placed within the lactobacillus acidophilus-delbrueckii  group. lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus johnsonii were the most closely related species, with 16s rrna gene sequence similarities of 99.53 and 99.46% to  the respective type strains. low gyrb gene sequence similarities (<90%) and low dna-dna reassociation values (<45%) were obtained between the strain and the phylogenetically closest neighbours. based on phenotypic and genetic evidence, the strain is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name lactobacillus taiwanensis sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is firdi 006t (=bcrc 17755t =dsm 21401t).

TI  == identification of probiotic lactobacilli used for animal feeds on the basis of 16s ribosomal rna gene sequence.
AB  == the use of probiotics such as lactobacillus in animal feeds has gained popularity in recent years. in this study the 16s rrna gene sequence of l. acidophilus in two commercial agents which have been used in animal feeds, lab-mos and ghenisson 22, was determined. phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the two agents, strain mnflm01 in lab-mos and strain gal-2 in ghenisson 22, belonged to l. rhamnosus (a member of the l. casei group) and l. johnsonii (a member of the l. acidophilus group), respectively. biochemical tests assigned the two as l. rhamnosus and ambiguously as l. acidophilus. the data suggest that 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis provides more accurate identification of lactobacillus species  than biochemical tests and would allow quality assurance of relevant commercial products. the 16s rrna gene sequences of strains mnflm01 and gal-2 determined in  this study have been submitted to the ddbj/embl/genbank accession numbers under accession numbers ab288235 and ab295648, respectively.

TI  == prediction of surface exposed proteins in streptococcus pyogenes, with a potential application to other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in silico prediction of bacterial surface exposed proteins is of growing interest for the rational development of vaccines and in the study of bacteria-host relationships, whether pathogenic or host beneficial. this interest is driven by the increase in the use of dna sequencing as a major tool in the early characterization of pathogenic bacteria and, more recently, even of complex ecosystems at the host-environment interface in metagenomics approaches. current  protein localization protocols are not suited to this prediction task as they ignore the potential surface exposition of many membrane-associated proteins. therefore, we developed a new flow scheme, surfg+, for the processing of protein  sequence data with the particular aim of identification of potentially surface exposed (pse) proteins from gram-positive bacteria, which was validated for streptococcus pyogenes. the results of an exploratory case study on closely related lactobacilli of the acidophilus group suggest that the yogurt bacterium lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (l. bulgaricus) dedicates a relatively  important fraction of its coding capacity to secreted proteins, while the probiotic gastrointestinal (gi) tract bacteria l. johnsonii and l. gasseri appear to encode a larger variety of pse proteins, that may play a role in the interaction with the host.

TI  == characterization of the amylovorin locus of lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471, producer of a bacteriocin active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, in combination with colistin and pyocins.
AB  == lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 produces amylovorin l, a bacteriocin with an antibacterial activity against some strains of the lactobacillus lineage. based on the sequence of one active peptide, a gene encoding active amylovorin l was cloned and sequenced. genome walking allowed us to sequence a larger fragment of  7577 bp of genomic dna, with 12 predicted orfs. the previously characterized amylovorin l peptide-encoding gene is preceded by another gene encoding a small polypeptide with a typical bacteriocin-processing double-glycine site, suggesting that amylovorin l is a two-component class iib bacteriocin (amylovorin lalpha/beta). lalpha and lbeta show the highest similarity to gassericin t from lactobacillus gasseri sbt2055 and blpn from streptococcus pneumoniae r6, respectively, and to lafa and lafx, which form the lactacin f bacteriocin of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533. as for other lactic acid bacteria bacteriocins,  amylovorin l showed no activity against the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen  pseudomonas aeruginosa on its own, but showed synergistic inhibitory activity when used in combination with the peptide antibiotic colistin, and, remarkably, with the p. aeruginosa soluble bacteriocins, pyocins s1 and s2.

TI  == single bioreactor gastrointestinal tract simulator for study of survival of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design an in vitro model system to evaluate the probiotic potential of food. a single bioreactor system-gastrointestinal tract simulator (gits) was chosen for process simulation on account of its considerable simplicity compared to multi-vessel systems used in previous studies. the bioreactor was evaluated by studying the viability of four known probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533, lactobacillus casei strain shirota, and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg) as a function of their physiological state. l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii survived in gits better when introduced at an early stationary or exponential phase compared to being previously stored for 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. these two species were more resistant to bile salts and survived better than l. casei and l. rhamnosus gg. the latter two species gave large losses (up to 6 log) in plate counts independent of growth state due to the bile. however, experiments with some commercial probiotic products containing lb. gg bacteria showed much better  survival compared with model food (modified deman-rogosa-sharpe growth medium), thus demonstrating the influence of the food matrix on the viability of bacteria. the study demonstrated that gits can be successfully used for evaluation of viability of probiotic bacteria and functionality of probiotic food.

TI  == analysis of the genome sequence of lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323 reveals the molecular basis of an autochthonous intestinal organism.
AB  == this study presents the complete genome sequence of lactobacillus gasseri atcc 33323, a neotype strain of human origin and a native species found commonly in the gastrointestinal tracts of neonates and adults. the plasmid-free genome was 1,894,360 bp in size and predicted to encode 1,810 genes. the gc content was 35.3%, similar to the gc content of its closest relatives, l. johnsonii ncc 533 (34%) and l. acidophilus ncfm (34%). two identical copies of the prophage lgai (40,086 bp), of the sfi11-like siphoviridae phage family, were integrated tandomly in the chromosome. a number of unique features were identified in the genome of l. gasseri that were likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer and may contribute to the survival of this bacterium in its ecological niche. l. gasseri encodes two restriction and modification systems, which may limit bacteriophage infection. l. gasseri also encodes an operon for production of heteropolysaccharides of high complexity. a unique alternative sigma factor was present similar to that of b. caccae atcc 43185, a bacterial species isolated from human feces. in addition, l. gasseri encoded the highest number of putative  mucus-binding proteins (14) among lactobacilli sequenced to date. selected phenotypic characteristics that were compared between atcc 33323 and other human  l. gasseri strains included carbohydrate fermentation patterns, growth and survival in bile, oxalate degradation, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells, in vitro. the results from this study indicated high intraspecies variability from a genome encoding traits important for survival and retention in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == characterization of dominant cultivable lactobacilli and their antibiotic resistance profiles from faecal samples of weaning piglets.
AB  == aims: to examine the lactic acid bacteria flora of weaning piglets, to define the distribution of different lactobacilli species in piglet faecal samples, and to determine the susceptibility phenotype to 11 antibiotic of different families. methods and results: the faecal samples were taken from piglets with good herd status at 11 and 28 days after weaning. the lactobacillus isolates (n = 129) from 78 animals housed in pairs in 39 pens were preliminarily identified by their morphology and biochemical characteristics. partial 16s ribosomal dna (16s rdna)  was used to identify the isolates to the species level, and rapd (randomly amplified polymorphism dna) profiles to differentiate lactobacillus isolates to the strain level. based on these studies, 67 strains were selected for antibiotic resistant tests. the most numerous lactobacillus species found in the piglets was lactobacillus reuteri (n = 43). other lactobacilli were l. salivarius (n = 15), l. agilis (n = 4), l. johnsonii (n = 2), l. vaginalis (n = 1), l. mucosae (n = 1) and l. gallinarum (n = 1). all the strains were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and gentamicin. two l. salivarius isolates and two l. reuteri isolates were found to be multiresistant. conclusions: this study indicates that the faecal lactobacillus flora in piglets consists mainly of l. reuteri, l. salivarius and l. acidophilus group lactobacilli, and the distribution of lactobacilli is similar between individuals of the same age and with the same diet. most of the lactobacillus isolates tested were sensitive to the antibiotics used in this study. significance and impact of the study: valuable information on lactobacillus species distribution and their antibiotic resistance profiles in piglets is obtained.

TI  == extensive horizontal transfer of core genome genes between two lactobacillus species found in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == background: while genes that are conserved between related bacterial species are  usually thought to have evolved along with the species, phylogenetic trees reconstructed for individual genes may contradict this picture and indicate horizontal gene transfer. individual trees are often not resolved with high confidence, however, and in that case alternative trees are generally not considered as contradicting the species tree, although not confirming it either.  here we conduct an in-depth analysis of 401 protein phylogenetic trees inferred with varying levels of confidence for three lactobacilli from the acidophilus complex. at present the relationship between these bacteria, isolated from environments as diverse as the gastrointestinal tract (lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus johnsonii) and yogurt (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus), is ambiguous due to contradictory phenotypical and 16s rrna based classifications. results: among the 401 phylogenetic trees, those that could be reconstructed with high confidence support the 16s-rrna tree or one alternative topology in an astonishing 3:2 ratio, while the third possible topology is practically absent. lowering the confidence threshold for trees to be taken into  consideration does not significantly affect this ratio, and therefore suggests that gene transfer may have affected as much as 40% of the core genome genes. gene function bias suggests that the 16s rrna phylogeny of the acidophilus complex, which indicates that l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus are the closest related of these three species, is correct. a novel approach of comparison of interspecies protein divergence data employed in this study allowed to determine that gene transfer most likely took place between the lineages of the two species found in the gastrointestinal tract. conclusion: this case-study  reports an unprecedented level of phylogenetic incongruence, presumably resulting from extensive horizontal gene transfer. the data give a first indication of the  large extent of gene transfer that may take place in the gastrointestinal tract and its accumulated effect. for future studies, our results should encourage a careful weighing of data on phylogenetic tree topology, confidence and distribution to conclude on the absence or presence and extent of horizontal gene transfer.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition  was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic  potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

TI  == similarity and differences in the lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  == a set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. multilocus sequence analysis, dna typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. on microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from lactobacillus johnsonii strain ncc533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of l. johnsonii. when projected on the ncc533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. a quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile dna. signatures for horizontal  gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in dna from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. on microarray hybridizations, lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence  intensities than the l. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from l. acidophilus hybridized to the l. johnsonii array. in-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of l. johnsonii with l. gasseri, l. acidophilus, and lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with lactobacillus casei; and scattered x-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. the observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the l. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == the in vitro effect of hydrogen peroxide on vaginal microbial communities.
AB  == this study presents a series of experiments carried out in order to elucidate the role of h2o2 in antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli. vaginal swabs were collected from 60 premenopausal women and checked for ph and nugent score, and lactobacillus species were cultured, phenotyped and genotyped. the main outcome measures involved: (1) species of vaginal lactobacilli most effective in liberating h2o2, (2) minimal microbicidal concentrations of added h2o2, (3) kinetics of h2o2 liberation in relation to oxygen tension, (4) antimicrobial activity of pure h2o2 versus one produced by selected vaginal lactobacilli and the total activity of their culture supernatants. results showed that h2o2 was liberated especially by: lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii and l. gasseri. hydrogen peroxide reached concentrations from 0.05 to 1.0 mm, which under intensive aeration increased even up to 1.8 mm. microorganisms related to vaginal pathologies show varied resistance to the action of pure h2o2. most potent inhibitory activity against bacteria and yeasts was presented by lactobacillus culture supernate producing h2o2, followed by the nonproducing strain and pure h2o2. to conclude - the antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli is a summation of  various inhibitory mechanisms in which h2o2 plays some but not a crucial role, in addition to other substances.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == lactobacillus johnsonii la1 attenuates helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis and reduces levels of proinflammatory chemokines in c57bl/6 mice.
AB  == in clinical settings, lactobacillus johnsonii la1 administration has been reported to have a favorable effect on helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis,  although the mechanism remains unclear. we administered, continuously through the water supply, live la1 to h. pylori-infected c57bl/6 mice and followed colonization, the development of h. pylori-associated gastritis in the lamina propria, and the levels of proinflammatory chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (mip-2) and keratinocyte-derived cytokine (kc) in the serum and gastric tissue over a period of 3 months. we documented a significant attenuation in both lymphocytic (p=0.038) and neutrophilic (p=0.003) inflammatory infiltration in the lamina propria as well as in the circulating levels of anti-h. pylori immunoglobulin g antibodies (p=0.003), although we did not observe a suppressive  effect of la1 on h. pylori colonizing numbers. other lactobacilli, such as l. amylovorus dce 471 and l. acidophilus ibb 801, did not attenuate h. pylori-associated gastritis to the same extent. mip-2 serum levels were distinctly reduced during the early stages of h. pylori infection in the la1-treated animals, as were gastric mucosal levels of mip-2 and kc. finally, we  also observed a significant reduction (p=0.046) in h. pylori-induced interleukin-8 secretion by human adenocarcinoma ags cells in vitro in the presence of neutralized (ph 6.8) la1 spent culture supernatants, without concomitant loss of h. pylori viability. these observations suggest that during the early infection stages, administration of la1 can attenuate h. pylori-induced gastritis in vivo, possibly by reducing proinflammatory chemotactic signals responsible for the recruitment of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the lamina propria.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.

AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

TI  == anaerobic induction of adherence to laminin in lactobacillus gasseri strains by contact with solid surface.
AB  == the effect of growth conditions on adhesion was studied in six species belonging  to lactobacillus acidophilus homology groups. namely, 17 strains including 6 fresh isolates of l. gasseri from human feces were assessed for their adherence to immobilized fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen. these extracellular matrix proteins were used as a model of damaged intestinal mucosa. when the bacteria were grown on mrs agar under anaerobic conditions, all eight l. gasseri  strains and one l. johnsonii strain showed strong adhesiveness to laminin, but not when grown in static mrs broth. a similar pattern was observed in four l. gasseri strains in terms of adherence to fibronectin. no l. gasseri or l. johnsonii strains exhibited adhesion to type iv collagen under either growth condition. adhesion of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus, and l. gallinarum was not affected by the growth conditions. although protease treatment of l. gasseri cells abolished the adhesion, periodate oxidation of the cells increased it except in one strain. the adherence of l. gasseri cells was diminished by periodate and alpha-mannosidase treatments of immobilized laminin.  the above results suggest that mannose-specific proteinaceous adhesion can be induced in l. gasseri by contact with a mucosal surface in the anaerobic intestinal lumen.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == antibacterial activity is an important characteristic of probiotics. a possible way to achieve this antibacterial activity is through the production of bacteriocins. this study shows that the commercial probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii la1 and lactobacillus casei yit 9029 produce bacteriocins. the nature of the antimicrobial compound could be derived from its  behaviour: a narrow inhibitory spectrum (only active against closely related strains), loss of activity when treated with proteinases, and rather small molecular masses (around 6000 da or less). further, three bacteriocins produced by lb. johnsonii la1, lb. casei yit 9029 and lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 showed inhibitory activity against the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori. however, a fourth bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus ibb 801 was not able to inhibit h. pylori. this indicates that some bacteriocins produced by specific probiotic strains can fulfil a role in the inhibition of this common pathogen.

AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == cbst2 from lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 is a transport protein of the major facilitator superfamily that facilitates bile acid antiport.
AB  == we previously identified two conjugated bile acid transporters, cbst1 and cbst2,  in lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 and lactobacillus acidophilus ks-13 that are gene duplicates encoded in tandem with a conjugated bile salt hydrolase (bsh) [elkins and savage, j. bacteriol. 180:4344-4349, 1998; elkins et al., microbiology 147: 3403-3412, 2001]. cbst2 from 100-100 was shown to increase taurocholic acid (tca) uptake in escherichia coli; however, higher levels were achieved when an extracellular factor (ef) from 100-100 was present in the assay  medium (spent medium from 100-100, ph 4.2). we continued this study here to determine the role of ef in this transport system. kinetic studies revealed that  the previously observed cbst2- and ef-mediated tca accumulation is rapid (< 15 s) but not saturable, suggesting that ef is limiting. in addition, uptake of tca by  e. coli expressing cbst2 was insensitive to ionophores, 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and thus, is independent of the proton  motive force. since bsh converts [24-(14)c]tca to [24-(14)c]cholic acid (ca), we  measured net radiolabel uptake in e. coli cells expressing transporter(s) and bsh. interestingly, such cells accumulated less 14c radiolabel (by approximately  half) than cells expressing cbst2 alone. these data can be explained if ca diffuses out of e. coli through the transporter(s). we, therefore, added exogenous, unlabeled ca to ef-spent media, which under our assay conditions, performed similarly to ef+ culture supernatant in tca and ca uptake assays. thus, unlabeled ca (a protonated, neutral lipophile) can partition directly into e. coli cells especially at low ph. these findings were validated in uptake assays with [3h]tca, which yields [3h]taurine (a hydrophilic moiety) upon hydrolysis by  the bsh. amounts of cell-associated 3h radiolabel remained similar in cells expressing cbst2 and bsh versus cells expressing only cbst2, both of which were higher than in cells expressing bsh alone. our data support a hypothesis that these transporters, which comprise a new subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily, facilitate antiport of tca and ca.

TI  == the genome sequence of the probiotic intestinal bacterium lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533.
AB  == lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533 is a member of the acidophilus group of intestinal lactobacilli that has been extensively studied for their "probiotic" activities that include, pathogen inhibition, epithelial cell attachment, and immunomodulation. to gain insight into its physiology and identify genes potentially involved in interactions with the host, we sequenced and analyzed the 1.99-mb genome of l. johnsonii ncc 533. strikingly, the organism completely lacked genes encoding biosynthetic pathways for amino acids, purine nucleotides,  and most cofactors. in apparent compensation, a remarkable number of uncommon and often duplicated amino acid permeases, peptidases, and phosphotransferase-type transporters were discovered, suggesting a strong dependency of ncc 533 on the host or other intestinal microbes to provide simple monomeric nutrients. genome analysis also predicted an abundance (>12) of large and unusual cell-surface proteins, including fimbrial subunits, which may be involved in adhesion to glycoproteins or other components of mucin, a characteristic expected to affect persistence in the gastrointestinal tract (git). three bile salt hydrolases and two bile acid transporters, proteins apparently critical for git survival, were also detected. in silico genome comparisons with the >95% complete genome sequence of the closely related lactobacillus gasseri revealed extensive synteny  punctuated by clear-cut insertions or deletions of single genes or operons. many  of these regions of difference appear to encode metabolic or structural components that could affect the organisms competitiveness or interactions with the git ecosystem.

TI  == use of group-specific and rapd-pcr analyses for rapid differentiation of lactobacillus strains from probiotic yogurts.
AB  == the increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli implicates the requirement of techniques that allow a rapid and reliable identification of these organisms. in  this study, group-specific pcr and rapd-pcr analyses were used to identify strains of the lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus groups most commonly used in probiotic yogurts. group-specific pcr with primers for the l. casei and l. acidophilus groups, as well as l. gasseri/johnsonii, could differentiate between 20 lactobacillus strains isolated from probiotic yogurts and assign these into the corresponding groups. for identification of these strains to species or strain level, rapd profiles of the 20 lactobacillus strains were compared with 11 reference strains of the l. acidophilus and l. casei group. all except one strain could be attributed unambigously to the species l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l. casei, and l. paracasei. dna reassociation analysis confirmed the classification resulting from the rapd-pcr.

TI  == detection and identification of lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == the microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli  followed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the birds were  raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu per gram of crop contents. many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by pcr-dgge. a rapid and simple ardra method was developed  to distinguish between the members of the l. acidophilus group. haeiii-ardra was  used for preliminary identification of isolates in the l. acidophilus group and to identify lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius. msei-ardra generated unique patterns for all species of the l. acidophilus group, identifying lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. the results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.

TI  == the role of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == literature reporting activity of probiotics in infections due to helicobacter pylori has been reviewed to assess their value in combating such infections. several in vitro studies show that lactobacilli or their cell-free cultures inhibit or kill h. pylori, prevent its adhesion to mammalian epithelial cells and prevent il8 release. in vivo models demonstrate that pre-treatment with a probiotic can prevent h. pylori infections and/or that administration of probiotics markedly reduced an existing infection. thirteen clinical trials have  been published. in six (180 patients), a probiotic was used alone; five of these  had an encouraging result-in three there were significantly reduced breath test readings and in two others some patients were cleared of infection. in seven further trials (682 patients), probiotics were added to a therapeutic regimen of  antibiotics, resulting in an increased cure rate in two studies, and reduced side-effects in four. trials in which fermented milk products or whole cultures of lactobacilli were used tended to show better results than when the probiotic was taken in the form of bacteria alone. not all the studies were randomised, double-blind and placebo controlled, and some involved only small numbers of patients. the results suggest that probiotics may have a place as adjunctive treatment in h. pylori infections and possibly in prophylaxis. future trials should address in particular the type of patient (asymptomatic volunteers, symptomatic patients), choice of probiotic strain(s), a wide range of probiotic strains (lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. gasseri, lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium longum, and bioyoghurts) have been used-some non-viable, regimens (doses and duration) and criteria of success (breath test, histology, culture, serology).

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == identification and characterization of novel surface proteins in lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == we have identified and sequenced the genes encoding the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) protein from six different strains of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus gasseri. both species harbor two apf genes, apf1 and apf2, which are in the same orientation and encode proteins of 257 to 326 amino acids. multiple alignments of the deduced amino acid sequences of these apf genes demonstrate a very strong sequence conservation of all of the genes with the exception of their central regions. northern blot analysis showed that both genes are transcribed, reaching their maximum expression during the exponential phase.  primer extension analysis revealed that apf1 and apf2 harbor a putative promoter  sequence that is conserved in all of the genes. western blot analysis of the licl cell extracts showed that apf proteins are located on the cell surface. intact cells of l. johnsonii revealed the typical cell wall architecture of s-layer-carrying gram-positive eubacteria, which could be selectively removed with licl treatment. in addition, the amino acid composition, physical properties, and genetic organization were found to be quite similar to those of s-layer proteins. these results suggest that apf is a novel surface protein of the lactobacillus acidophilus b-homology group which might belong to an s-layer-like family.

TI  == lipoteichoic acids from lactobacillus johnsonii strain la1 and lactobacillus acidophilus strain la10 antagonize the responsiveness of human intestinal epithelial ht29 cells to lipopolysaccharide and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) respond to lipopolysaccharide (lps) from gram-negative bacteria in the presence of the soluble form of cd14 (scd14), a major endotoxin receptor. since scd14 is also known to interact with gram-positive bacteria and their components, we looked at whether scd14 could mediate their effects on human iecs. to this end, we examined the production of proinflammatory cytokines following exposure of the iecs to specific gram-positive bacteria or their lipoteichoic acids (ltas) in the absence and presence of human milk as a source of scd14. in contrast to lps from escherichia  coli or salmonella enteritidis, neither the gram-positive bacteria lactobacillus  johnsonii strain la1 and lactobacillus acidophilus strain la10 nor their ltas stimulated iecs, even in the presence of scd14. however, both ltas inhibited the  scd14-mediated lps responsiveness of iecs. we have previously hypothesized that scd14 in human milk is a means by which the neonate gauges the bacterial load in  the intestinal lumen and liberates protective proinflammatory cytokines from iecs. the present observations suggest that gram-positive organisms, via their ltas, temper this response and prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response.

TI  == genes encoding bile salt hydrolases and conjugated bile salt transporters in lactobacillus johnsonii 100-100 and other lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacillus johnsonii strain 100-100 expresses two antigenically distinct conjugated bile salt hydrolases (bsh), alpha and beta, that combine to form native homo- and heterotrimers. this paper reports characterization of loci within the genome that encode this capacity. a locus that encodes bsh beta (cbsh  beta), a partial (cbst1) and a complete conjugated bile salt transporter (cbst2)  was identified previously. dna sequence analysis at this locus was extended and revealed a complete orf for cbst1 and no other orfs in tandem. the three genes, cbst1, cbst2 and cbsh beta, probably constitute an operon; a putative promoter was identified upstream of cbst1. a second locus that expresses bsh activity in strain 100-100 was identified. sequence analysis of the clone predicted a 978 nt  orf that did not share tandem organization with other orfs, was similar in sequence to other bsh genes, and matched, in predicted protein sequence, the first 25 amino acids of bsh alpha. a phenotypic screen for bsh activity and a genetic screen for the cbsh beta locus were performed on 50 lactobacillus isolates from humans or dairy products. nearly all of the isolates that were positive for cbsh beta were from human sources. variability in the bsh phenotype  and cbsh beta genotype was identified in isolates of the same species. dna sequence was obtained and analysed from the cbsh beta locus of one human isolate, l. acidophilus strain ks-13. this organism has cbst1, cbst2 and cbs beta genes that are 84, 87 and 85% identical in dna sequence to those of strain 100-100. dna sequence identity to strain 100-100 ends in regions flanking this locus. the findings of this study suggest that bsh genes have been acquired horizontally and that bsh activity is important at some level for lactobacilli to colonize the lower gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == characterization of the lactobacillus casei group and the lactobacillus acidophilus group by automated ribotyping.
AB  == a total of 91 type and reference strains of the lactobacillus casei group and the l acidophilus group were characterized by the automated ribotyping device riboprinter microbial characterization system. the l. casei group was divided into five (c1-c5) genotypes by ribotyping. among them, the strain of l. casei atcc 334 was clustered to the same genotype group as most of l. paracasei strains and l casei jcm 1134t generated a riboprint pattern that was different from the type strain of l. zeae. these results supported the designation of l. casei atcc  334 as the neotype strain, but were not consistent with the reclassification of l. casei jcm 1134t as l. zeae. the l. acidophilus group was also divided into 14  (a1-a11, b1-b3) genotypes by ribotyping. l. acidophilus, l. amylovorus, l. crispatus and l. gallinarum generated ribotype patterns that were distinct from the patterns produced by l. gasseri and l. johnsonii. this result confirmed previous data that the l. acidophilus group divided to two major clusters. five strains of l. acidophilus and two strains of l. gasseri were correctly reidentified by ribotyping. most strains belonging to the l. casei group and the  l. acidophilus group were discriminated at the species level by automated ribotyping. thus this riboprinter system yields rapid, accurate and reproducible  genetic information for the identification of many strains.

AB  == objective: the supernatant of lactobacillus johnsonii la1 culture was shown to be bactericidal and to have a partial, acid-independent suppressive effect on helicobacter pylori in humans. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of l. johnsonii la1-acidified milk (lc-1) on h. pylori infection. design and methods: fifty-three volunteers infected with h. pylori as determined  by positive 13c-urea breath test and positive serology were randomized to receive either lc-1 or a placebo 180 ml twice a day for 3 weeks. all subjects also received clarithromycin 500 mg bid during the last two weeks of acidified milk therapy. oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and biopsies were performed at inclusion and repeated 4-8 weeks after the end of the treatment. h. pylori infection was confirmed by urease test and histology. h. pylori density and inflammation were scored using a modified sydney classification. results: lc-1 ingestion induced a  decrease in h. pylori density in the antrum (p= 0.02) and the corpus (p= 0.04). lc-1 also reduced inflammation and gastritis activity in the antrum (p= 0.02 and  p= 0.01, respectively) and of activity in the corpus (p= 0.02). clarithromycin eradicated h. pylori in 26% of the subjects; lc-1 did not improve the antibiotic  effect. conclusion: these results suggest that h. pylori infection and gastritis  can be down-regulated by lc-1.

AB  == the strongly hydrophobic bacteriocin amylovorin l471 from lactobacillus amylovorus dce 471 was isolated and purified to homogeneity from complex culture  broth by a novel, rapid and simple three-step protocol including (i) ammonium sulphate precipitation, (ii) chloroform/methanol extraction/precipitation and (iii) reversed-phase hplc, the only chromatographic step involved. the molecular  mass of the peptide was determined to be 4876.9 da by electrospray mass spectrometric analysis. n-terminal amino acid sequencing identified 35 amino acid residues as being identical to the n-terminal sequence of lactobin a, a bacteriocin from another l. amylovorus strain. these non-identical strains produce bacteriocins that display small differences in molecular mass and inhibitory spectrum. the amino acid sequence of amylovorin l471 shared significant homology with lactacin x, one of the two bactericidal peptides produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi11088. a purified amylovorin l471 preparation permitted confirmation of the inhibitory spectrum previously established with a crude extract. it displayed a bactericidal mode of action on lactobacilli after an extremely rapid adsorption to the target cells. two listeria spp. were only weakly sensitive. amylovorin l471 appears to be produced  constitutively. ethanol not only stimulated specific bacteriocin production but also prevented adsorption of the bacteriocin molecules to the producer cells upon prolonged fermentation. the latter result supports the hypothesis that the apparent inactivation of bacteriocin observed during the stationary phase of batch fermentations is due to adsorption.

TI  == effect of whey-based culture supernatant of lactobacillus acidophilus (johnsonii) la1 on helicobacter pylori infection in humans.
AB  == background: specific strains of lactobacillus acidophilus are known to inhibit intestinal cell adhesion and invasion by enterovirulent bacteria. as l. acidophilus can survive transiently in the human stomach, it may downregulate helicobacter pylori infection. methods: the ability of l. acidophilus (johnsonii) la1 supernatant to interfere with h. pylori bacterial growth, urease activity, and adhesion to epithelial cells was tested in vitro. its effect on h. pylori infection in volunteers was monitored in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial, using a drinkable, whey-based, la1 culture supernatant. h. pylori infected volunteers were treated 14 days with 50 ml of la1 supernatant four times a day combined with either omeprazole 20 mg four times a day or with placebo. infection was assessed by breath test, endoscopy, and biopsy sampling, performed  at inclusion, immediately at the end of the treatment (breath test only), and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment. results: la1 supernatant inhibited h. pylori growth in vitro, regardless of previous binding of h. pylori to epithelial cells. in 20 subjects (8 females, 12 males, mean age 33.1 years) a marked decrease in breath test values was observed immediately after treatment with la1  supernatant, both in the omeprazole and in the placebo group (median 12.3 vs. 28.8 and 9.4 vs. 20.4, respectively; p < 0.03). in both treatment groups, breath  test values remained low 6 weeks after treatment (omeprazole treated 19.2, placebo treated 8. 3; p < 0.03 vs. pretreatment), but the persistence of h. pylori infection was confirmed in gastric biopsies. conclusion: la1 culture supernatant shown to be effective in vitro has a partial, acid-independent long-term suppressive effect on h. pylori in humans.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (formerly known as lactobacillus acidophilus la1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. the first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (group a) alone or s. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 (group b). group c received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained s. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1. ingestion of l. johnsonii la1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. however, l. johnsonii la1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from  the feces of the volunteers of groups b and c. the fermented base alone showed a  weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. however, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 significantly enhanced both functions. the product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1 had no significant effect on either function. these results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.

AB  == the influence of ph on the adhesion of two lactobacillus strains to caco-2 human  intestinal cells was investigated. one strain, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, was adherent at any ph between 4 and 7. the other one, l. acidophilus la10, did not attach to this cell line under the same experimental conditions. on the basis of  these results, we used the monoclonal antibody technique as a tool to determine differences on the surface of these bacteria and to identify a factor for adhesion. mice were immunized with live la1, and the hybridomas produced by fusion of spleen cells with ons1 cells were screened for the production of antibodies specific for l. johnsonii la1. a set of these monoclonal antibodies was directed against a nonproteinaceous component of the l. johnsonii la1 surface. it was identified as lipoteichoic acid (lta). this molecule was isolated, chemically characterized, and tested in adhesion experiments in the same system. the adhesion of l. johnsonii la1 to caco-2 cells was inhibited in a  concentration-dependent way by purified lta as well as by l. johnsonii la1 culture supernatant that contained lta. these results showed that the mechanism of adhesion of l. johnsonii la1 to human caco-2 cells involves lta.

AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == functional analysis of the gene encoding immunity to lactacin f, lafi, and its use as a lactobacillus-specific, food-grade genetic marker.
AB  == lactacin f is a two-component class ii bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus johnsonii vpi 11088. the laf operon is composed of the bacteriocin structural genes, lafa and lafx, and a third open reading frame, orfz. two strategies were employed to study the function of orfz. this gene was disrupted in the chromosome of nck64, a lafa729 lafx orfz derivative of vpi 11088. a disruption cassette consisting of orfz interrupted with a cat gene was cloned into psa3 and introduced into nck64. manipulation of growth temperatures and antibiotic selection resulted in homologous recombination which disrupted the chromosomal copy of orfz with the cat gene. this orfz mutation resulted in loss of immunity to lactacin f but had little effect on production of lafx, which is not bactericidal without lafa. expression of orfz in this orfz- background rescued the immune phenotype. expression of orfz in a bacteriocin-sensitive derivative of vpi 11088 also reestablished immunity. these data indicate that orfz, renamed lafi, encodes the immunity factor for the lactacin f system. the sensitivity of various lactobacillus strains to lactacin f was further evaluated. lactacin f inhibited 11 strains including several members of the a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, and b2  l. acidophilus homology groups. expression of lafi in bacteriocin-sensitive strains l. acidophilus atcc 4356, l. acidophilus ncfm/n2, l. fermentum ncdo1750,  l. gasseri atcc 33323, and l. johnsonii atcc 33200 provided immunity to lactacin  f. furthermore, it was shown that lactacin f production by vpi 11088 could be used to select for l. fermentum ncdo1750 transformants containing the recombinant plasmid encoding lafi. the data demonstrate that lafi is functional in heterologous hosts, suggesting that it may be a suitable food-grade genetic marker for use in lactobacillus species.

TI  == the presence of two s-layer-protein-encoding genes is conserved among species related to lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == previously we have shown that the type strain of lactobacillus acidophilus possesses two s-protein-encoding genes, one of which is silent, on a chromosomal  segment of 6 kb. the s-protein-encoding gene in the expression site can be exchanged for the silent s-protein-encoding gene by inversion of this slp segment. in this study the presence of s-protein and corresponding s-protein-encoding genes of strains belonging to species that are closely related to l. acidophilus was determined. all strains investigated were identified by numerical comparison of highly standardized one-dimensional sds-page whole-cellular-protein patterns. western blot and southern blot methods were used to identify the presence of, and homology between, s-proteins and s-protein-encoding genes. from these analyses we conclude that strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum possess an s-layer and contain two slp genes. strains of l. helveticus possess an s-layer but have only  one intact slp gene. strains of l. gasseri, l. johnsonii and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus have neither an s-layer nor s-protein-encoding genes hybridizing with probes derived from the l. acidophilus slpa or slpb region. the  presence of a highly conserved 5' region in the slp genes of strains of l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. amylovorus and l. gallinarum suggests that s-layer  variation is a common feature for strains of these species.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.

TI  == evaluation of random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr as a method to differentiate lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus johnsonii.
AB  == the technique random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr was evaluated as a method to differentiate lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus johnsonii. representative strains, including the type of each species, were selected from different clusters obtained by numerical analysis of  total soluble cell protein patterns. results obtained by rapd-pcr corresponded well with results obtained by numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns. the type strains of each species displayed different rapd profiles. strains with identical l(+)- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent lactic dehydrogenase (nldh) electrophoretic profiles could be distinguished on the basis of their rapd profiles.

TI  == hemagglutination activity of lactobacillus acidophilus group lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the cells of 28 strains of the lactobacillus acidophilus group were evaluated for hemagglutination (ha) activity. the activity was found in the surface layer (sl)  protein fraction extracted by 2 m guanidine hydrochloride. the most sl proteins from the a group strains (l. acidophilus (a1), l. crispatus (a2), l. amylovorus (a3), and l. gallinarum (a4)) showed ha activity, but the proteins from the b group strains (l. gasseri (b1) and l. johnsonii (b2)) showed no activity. the sl  proteins from the a group strains were composed in common of a main component having molecular mass of about 40-45 kda on sds-page. the sl proteins from jcm 1034 strain that showed the highest ha activity was fractionated by cm-toyopearl  ion-exchange chromatography. the highest ha activity was detected in the major protein of 41 kda. this protein was purified and shown to be composed of about 50% of hydrophobic amino acids. the ha activity of the protein (1034 lectin) was  specifically inhibited by fetuin and bovine lactoferrin at the concentrations of  80 and 160 micrograms/ml, respectively. the removal of n-acetylneuraminic acid from fetuin significantly decreased the inhibitory activity.

TI  == identification and classification of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. johnsonii strains by sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization.
AB  == thirty-two strains originally identified as lactobacillus acidophilus and l. gasseri were screened for their taxonomic homogeneity by sds-page of whole-cell proteins. after numerical comparison of the resulting protein electrophoretic fingerprints, two well-delineated clusters were detected. the majority of the strains grouped in one electrophoretic cluster, which contained the type strain of l. acidophilus and corresponds to dna group a1 of johnson, j. l., phelps, c. f., cummins, c. s., london, j. & gasser, f. (1980; international journal of systematic bacteriology 30, 53-68). another cluster corresponded to dna group b.  it contained two subclusters, which agreed perfectly with dna subgroups b1 (l. gasseri) and b2 (l. johnsonii), respectively. the 23s rrna genes were partially sequenced and 23s-rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes were designed for identification of dna groups a1, b1 and b2. probe lbg reacted with all strains of electrophoretic cluster b1 (l. gasseri), probe lbj hybridized with strains of cluster b2 (l. johnsonii) and probe lba with strains of cluster a1 (authentic l.  acidophilus). the probes were successfully used for the identification of strains belonging to the respective species. the phylogenetic relationship of a representative of l. johnsonii was determined by comparative sequence analysis of the 16s rrna genes. it is very closely related to l. gasseri.

TI  == taxonomic study of the lactobacillus acidophilus group, with recognition of lactobacillus gallinarum sp. nov. and lactobacillus johnsonii sp. nov. and synonymy of lactobacillus acidophilus group a3 (johnson et al. 1980) with the type strain of lactobacillus amylovorus (nakamura 1981).
AB  == biochemical properties and dna-dna reassociation studies of lactobacillus acidophilus strains isolated from humans and animals indicate that these include  six genomospecies. two new species can be differentiated from the established species of the genus lactobacillus: l. gallinarum sp. nov. (type strain, atcc 33199) and l. johnsonii sp. nov. (type strain, atcc 33200). furthermore, it was clarified that l. acidophilus group a3 (johnson et al. 1980) is synonymous with l. amylovorus.
