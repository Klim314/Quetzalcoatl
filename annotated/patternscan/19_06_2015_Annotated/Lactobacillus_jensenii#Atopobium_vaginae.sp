TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == colonization of the upper genital tract by vaginal bacterial species in nonpregnant women.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to evaluate the upper genital tract (ugt) presence of vaginal bacterial species using sensitive molecular methods capable of detecting fastidious bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacteria. study design: vaginal swabs were collected prior to hysterectomy. the excised uterus was sterilely opened and swabs collected from the endometrium and upper endocervix. dna was tested in 11 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for 12 bacterial species: lactobacillus iners, l crispatus, l jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, megasphaera spp, prevotella spp, leptotrichia/sneathia, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, and a broad-range16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene assay. endometrial fluid was tested with luminex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines and defensins and tissue for gene expression of defensins and cathelicidin. results: we enrolled 58 women: mean aged 43 +/- 7 years, mostly white (n = 46; 79%) and bv negative (n = 43; 74%). by species-specific quantitative pcr, 55 (95%) had ugt colonization with at least 1  species (n = 52) or were positive by 16s pcr (n = 3). the most common species were l iners (45% ugt, 61% vagina), prevotella spp (33% ugt, 76% vagina) and l crispatus (33% ugt, 56% vagina). median quantities of bacteria in the ugt were lower than vaginal levels by 2-4 log10 ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene copies per swab. there were no differences in the endometrial inflammatory markers between women with no bacteria, lactobacillus only, or any bv-associated species in the ugt. conclusion: our data suggest that the endometrial cavity is not sterile in most women undergoing hysterectomy and that the presence of low levels of bacteria in the uterus is not associated with significant inflammation.

TI  == effect of sexual debut on vaginal microbiota in a cohort of young women.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis is uncommon in women who are virgins. we estimated effects of sexual debut on vaginal bacterial colonization. methods: women who were virgins and aged 18-22 years enrolled in a study of human papillomavirus acquisition were followed every 4 months for up to 2 years. vaginal swabs from before and after sexual debut or two independent visits for those remaining virgins were tested by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, gardnerella vaginalis, and the bacterial vaginosis-associated species atopobium vaginae, megasphaera species, leptotrichia species, sneathia species, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1, -2, and -3. results: we evaluated 97 women: 71  who became sexually active and 26 who remained virgins. at first sampling, 22 of  26 (85%) women who remained virgins were colonized with lactobacillus species compared with 22 of 26 (85%) at follow-up (p>.99). g vaginalis was present in 12  of 26 (46%) initially and 11 of 26 (42%) at follow-up (p>.99). among women who became sexually active, colonization with lactobacillus species remained stable:  65 of 71 (92%) compared with 66 of 71 (93%) (p>.99), whereas colonization with g  vaginalis increased (28 of 71 [39%] compared with 40 of 71 [56%]; p=.02). among women who did not initiate sexual activity during the study, two of 26 (8%) had any bacterial vaginosis-associated species detected at both the first and second  visits (p>.99). among women who became sexually active during the study, 15 of 71 (21%) were colonized with bacterial vaginosis-associated species initially compared with 13 of 71 (18%) after sexual debut (p=.77). conclusions: among women who were virgins, vaginal colonization with bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterial species is uncommon and does not change after sexual debut.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  == to preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial dna as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed pcr-based detection of 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina  and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from dna extracted from body fluids and stains. as a result, 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. bacterial genes detected in female urine  might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. in addition, those of lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in dna samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, dna samples prepared for the  identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. in  conclusion, 16s ribosomal rna genes of l. crispatus, l. jensenii and a. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.

TI  == strong correspondence in bacterial loads between the vagina and rectum of pregnant women.
AB  == we sampled the vagina and rectum in 71 pregnant women and bacterial loads of lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. iners, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae were determined by culture and quantitative pcr (qpcr). culture and qpcr results differed substantially with regard to the evaluation of  vaginal and rectal occurrence of the six species tested. the vaginal-rectal prevalence of l. crispatus, l. jensenii, l. gasseri, l. iners, g. vaginalis and a. vaginae as established by culture vs. pcr was 32.3 vs. 91.5%, 32.3 vs. 77.4%,  28.1 vs. 91.5%, 12.6 vs. 68.5%, 12.6 vs. 74.6% and 5.6 vs. 69.0%, respectively. using qpcr, a significant positive correlation was found between vaginal and rectal loads of l. crispatus (p < 0.0001), l. jensenii (p < 0.0001), l. gasseri (p = 0.005), l. iners (p = 0.003) and a. vaginae (p = 0.002). in summary, significant correlations between quantities of vaginal and rectal lactobacilli and of atopobium vaginae were established by means of qpcr, indicating strong correspondence of vaginal and rectal microflora, not only in the occurrence of certain species in both niches, but also of cell densities per bacterial species.

TI  == the human vaginal bacterial biota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the bacterial biota of the human vagina can have a profound impact on the health  of women and their neonates. changes in the vaginal microbiota have been associated with several adverse health outcomes including premature birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, and acquisition of hiv infection. cultivation-independent molecular methods have provided new insights regarding bacterial diversity in this important niche, particularly in women with the common condition bacterial vaginosis (bv). pcr methods have shown that women with bv have complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include many fastidious species, particularly from the phyla bacteroidetes and actinobacteria. healthy women are mostly colonized with lactobacilli such as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, and lactobacillus iners, though a variety of other bacteria may be present. the microbiology of bv is heterogeneous. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae coating the vaginal epithelium in some subjects with bv suggests that biofilms may contribute to this condition.

TI  == quantitative determination by real-time pcr of four vaginal lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between l. gasseri and l. iners.
AB  == background: most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. here we applied existing real-time pcr formats for lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for atopobium vaginae, l. iners and l. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years.  results: the 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the ison and hay criteria, as refined by verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade ia: 8 samples, grade iab: 10, grade ib: 13, grade i-like: 10, grade ii: 11, grade iii: 12 and grade iv: 7.l. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent lactobacillus species detected. a significantly lower concentration of l. crispatus was found in grades ii (p < 0.0001) and iii (p = 0.002) compared to grade i. l. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade iab than in grade ia (p = 0.024). a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade iii, with log10 median concentrations (log10 mc), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. twenty (38.5%) of the 52 g. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for a. vaginae. in grade ii we found almost no l. iners (log10 mc: 0/ml) but a high concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 8.7/ml). by contrast, in grade iii we found a high concentration of l. iners (log10 mc: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 0/ml). these results show a negative association between l. gasseri and l. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between l. gasseri and a. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). conclusion: in our study we found a clear negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri and between a. vaginae and l. gasseri. our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade ii is an intermediate stage between grades i and iii, because l. gasseri, abundant in grade ii is not predominant in grade iii, whereas l. iners,  abundant in grade iii is present only in low numbers in grade ii samples.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of atopobium vaginae.
AB  == background: previous studies have indicated that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, atopobium vaginae is associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of bv. methods: nine strains of atopobium vaginae, four strains of gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of lactobacillus iners and one strain each of bifidobacterium breve, b. longum, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the etest. results: all nine strains of a. vaginae were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: < 0.016 microg/ml), rifampicin (< 0.002 microg/ml), azithromycin (< 0.016-0.32 microg/ml), penicillin (0.008-0.25 microg/ml), ampicillin (< 0.016-0.94 microg/ml), ciprofloxacin (0.023-0.25 microg/ml) and linezolid (0.016-0.125 microg/ml). we found a variable susceptibility for metronidazole, ranging from 2  to more than 256 microg/ml. the four g. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (< 0.016-0.047 microg/ml) and three strains were susceptible to less than 1 microg/ml of metronidazole. all lactobacilli were resistant to metronidazole (> 256 microg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0.023-0.125 microg/ml). conclusion: clindamycin has higher activity against g. vaginalis and  a. vaginae than metronidazole, but not all a. vaginae isolates are metronidazole  resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on  a more limited number of strains.
