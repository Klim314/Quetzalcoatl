TI  == evaluation of the effectiveness of a pathogen inactivation technology against clinically relevant transfusion-transmitted bacterial strains.
AB  == background: to increase blood safety, various procedures are currently implemented, including donor selection, optimized donor arm disinfection, and diversion. in addition, pathogen inactivation (pi) techniques can be used for platelets (plts) and plasma concentrates. study design and methods: this study investigated the clinical efficacy of an inactivation technique for different blood components at two time points (12 and 35.5 hr). eight transfusion-relevant  bacterial strains were spiked at two different concentrations (100 and 1000 colony-forming units [cfus]/bag) into whole blood (wb), apheresis plts (aps), and buffy coat (bc)-derived minipool plts. results: the bacterial concentrations were higher than 106 cfus/ml within 24 hours after spiking depending on the particular bacterial strain. pi was absolute for all of the aps performed 12 hours after inoculation, but the bacterial strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus cereus were not completely inactivated in wb or bc plts, performed 35.5 and 12 hours after inoculation, respectively. conclusion: the intercept pi system was not 100% effective for high concentrations of certain k. pneumoniae strains or spore-forming b. cereus. a critical observation was that the period between blood donation and inactivation needs to be minimal to enable efficient pi. in the case where pi cannot be performed immediately after preparation, a combination of a pi technology after the production of blood components with a rapid bacterial screen test on day 4 or 5 after donation may offer a solution to further prevent the risk of bacterial transmission by transfusion.

TI  == challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the theraflex mb-plasma technology.
AB  == background and objectives: although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. this study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (mb) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. materials and methods: bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the theraflex mb-plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, mb/light treatment and mb filtration. virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. results: leucocyte  filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than  4 logs (staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of  detection (lod) (>/= 4.8 logs; escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and klebsiella pneumoniae). mb/light and mb filtration further reduced staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus to below the lod. the small bacterium brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the lod by additional mb/light treatment and mb filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by theraflex mb-plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. conclusion: theraflex mb-plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == antibacterial potency of housefly larvae extract from sewage sludge through bioconversion.
AB  == use of the fly to convert sewage sludge into nutrient-rich soil conditioner and amendment is an attractive approach for sludge bioconversion. during this process, fecal coliforms, an indicating pathogen, in sludge were reduced to 5.3 x 10(2) most probable number/g dry solid from initial 3.32 x 10(6) mpn/g dry solid. it was also found that the extract of larvae grown in sludge during bioconversion have an observable inhibitory effect against bacteria compared to larvae grown in wheat bran as measured by minimum bacterial concentration tests. in vitro antimicrobial assay tests over time also showed that the extract had strong inhibitory efficiencies of ca. 99% against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, while  the efficiency was 69% and 57% against bacillus subtilis and klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. the observed pathogenic bacterial cell membrane damage  was found to be responsible for the phenomenon mentioned above, with nuclear acids leaching out quickly and alkaline phosphatase increasing in the outer membrane, followed by an increase of beta-galactosidase in the inner membrane. clearly, housefly larvae extract from sewage sludge through bioconversion possesses antibacterial potency against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of 2-alkynoic fatty acids against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the first study aimed at determining the structural characteristics needed to prepare antibacterial 2-alkynoic fatty acids (2-afas) was accomplished by synthesizing several 2-afas and other analogs in 18-76% overall yields. among all the compounds tested, the 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-hda) displayed the best overall  antibacterial activity against gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (mic=15.6 mug/ml), staphylococcus saprophyticus (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and bacillus cereus (mic=31.3 mug/ml), as well as against the gram-negative klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8 mug/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic=125 mug/ml). in addition, 2-hda displayed significant antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) atcc 43300 (mic=15.6 mug/ml) and clinical isolates of mrsa (mic=3.9 mug/ml). no direct relationship was found between the antibacterial activity of 2-afas and their critical micelle concentration (cmc) suggesting that the antibacterial properties of these fatty acids are not mediated by micelle formation. it was demonstrated that the presence of a triple bond at c-2 and the  carboxylic acid moiety in 2-afas are important for their antibacterial activity.  2-hda has the potential to be further evaluated for use in antibacterial formulations.

TI  == cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == isolation and screening of bioactive principle from chaetomorpha antennina against certain bacterial strains.
AB  == microbial pathogens develop resistance to a particular antibiotic after repeated  administration during the treatment of infectious diseases. moreover, multiple drug resistance is a very common problem especially in hospital acquired infections. therefore, it is necessary to find out alternative antibacterial drugs and the present trend is focused on seaweeds. this preliminary research work was carried out to find out the antibacterial activity of petroleum ether extract of chaetomorpha antennina. the extracts were tested against staphylococcus aureus mtcc 121, bacillus cereus mtcc 492, bacillus subtilis mtcc  441, klebsiella pneumoniae mtcc 530, escherichia coli mtcc 443 and pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 779 by agar well diffusion technique. it was observed that petroleum ether extract showed prominent zone of inhibition against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus even at 50 mug/ml concentration. the maximum spectrum of activity was observed against staphylococcus aureus ranged from 7.3 +/- 0.8 to 18 +/- 2.4 mm at the concentration 50 to 500 mug/ml, respectively. hence the most susceptible bacterium was staphylococcus aureus among the tested organisms. however, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa are also susceptible. but the bacillus cereus and klebsiella pneumoniae are resistant against the tested extract.

TI  == enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  == bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. we have recently shown that synthetic  antimicrobial peptides named pd1-pd4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of arg-trp (rw1-rw5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. in the present study, we selected pd3, pd4, rw2, rw3 and rw4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. the peptide combinations (rw2 + rw4, rw2 + rw3 + rw4 and pd4 + rw3 + rw4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 mum. time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial  activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. the present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept  of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == plant-based hydrocarbon esters from tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  == antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against burkholderia pseudomallei (khw), aeromonas hydrophila, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and streptococcus pneumoniae. interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus and proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against k. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, b. pseudomallei, alcaligens viscolactis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane  and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. for example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (mic of 7.8 microg/ml) against a. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (mic of 15.6 microg/ml) against p. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (mic of 31.25 microg/ml) on b. pseudomallei. cytotoxic effects of compounds were  assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an xtt assay. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. the 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. the vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. in conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane  isolated from t. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.

TI  == endophthalmitis.
AB  == endophthalmitis means bacterial or fungal infection inside the eye involving the  vitreous and/or aqueous humors. most cases are exogenous and occur after eye surgery, after penetrating ocular trauma, or as an extension of corneal infection. an increasing number of cases are occurring after intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) medications. endophthalmitis may also be endogenous, arising from bacteraemic or fungaemic seeding of the eye. the infected eye never serves as a source of bacteraemia or fungaemia, however. the most common pathogens in endophthalmitis vary by category. coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common causes of post-cataract endophthalmitis, and these bacteria and viridans streptococci cause most cases of post-intravitreal anti-vegf injection endophthalmitis, bacillus cereus is a major cause of post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and staphylococcus aureus and streptococci are important causes of endogenous endophthalmitis associated with endocarditis. in taiwan and other east asian nations, klebsiella  pneumoniae causes most cases of endogenous endophthalmitis, in association with liver abscess. endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in hospitalized patients is usually caused by candida species, particularly candida albicans. acute endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. the most important component of treatment is the intravitreal injection of antibiotics, along with vitrectomy in severe cases. systemic antibiotics should be used in cases of endogenous endophthalmitis and exogenous fungal endophthalmitis, but their role in exogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is uncertain. repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics may be necessary if there is no response to the initial therapy. many eyes that receive prompt and appropriate treatment will recover useful vision.

TI  == a broad-range method to detect genomic dna of multiple pathogenic bacteria based  on the aggregation strategy of gold nanorods.
AB  == it remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. this work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16s rdna region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (gnrs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (lspr) property. in the quantitative detection of artificial sequence,  the limit of detection (lod) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pm level. this pair of universal gnrs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (pcs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing serratia marcescens-spiked pcs. therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective dna analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in pcs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.

TI  == defense role of the cocoon in the silk worm bombyx mori l.
AB  == silk from the domesticated silk worm bombyx mori procures foreign body response naturally, so it has been utilized as a biomaterial for decades. in india the prime focus of the sericulture industry is to improve silk production with high quality silk. naturally, the silk worm builds its cocoon not only with silk proteins, but also with antimicrobial proteins to avoid infection since the cocoon is non-motile and non-feeding. the aim of the present study is to elucidate the antimicrobial proteins that persist in the cocoon of the silk worm  bombyx mori. at the pupal stage, the silk worm cocoon shell extract was prepared  from the day of pupation (p0) to the day of natural rupture of the cocoon for the eclosion of moth (nr). using the cocoon shell extract a microbial susceptibility  test was performed by the disc diffusion method against the microbes escherchia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the development of a zone of inhibition against the microbes confirmed the presence of antimicrobial/immunogenic activity of the cocoon shell extract. for further analysis, the cocoon shell extract was subjected to 7-15% sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the protein profile of the cocoon extract revealed the coomassie blue stained bands resolved from the 150-15 kda molecular range. interestingly, a polypeptide localized at around 29 kda showed remarkable expressional changes during the development of pupa. to characterize the 29 kda protein, it was eluted from the gel, digested with trypsin and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms). the trypsin-digested peptide  peaks were analyzed through mascot and peptides were matched with the ncbi nr database. the peptides were very well matched with the 18 wheeler protein, which  is reported to be responsible for innate immunity, belonging to the toll family in insects and responsible for cellular mediated immunity.

AB  == background: a single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. there is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (plts), and red blood cells. study design and methods: in this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (amps) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored plt concentrates (pcs). nine synthetic amps, four from plt microbicidal protein-derived peptides (pd1-4) and five arg-trp (rw) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and pc samples spiked with staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus cereus. a 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. results: in both plasma alone and pcs,  rw3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and k. pneumoniae; pd4 and rw2 against p. aeruginosa; and rw4 against k. pneumoniae. the activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. conclusions: these findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic amps against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, pcs, and other blood products.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == the microbiota of lafun, an african traditional cassava food product.
AB  == lafun is a fermented cassava food product consumed in parts of west africa. in the present work the microorganisms (aerobic bacteria (ab), lactic acid bacteria  (lab) and yeasts) associated with the fermentation of lafun under traditional conditions have for the first time been studied using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods. during lafun fermentation the ab count ranged from 6-7 log(10) cfu/g at the beginning to 9 log(10) cfu/g at the end. similarly, the number of lab increased from 5 log(10) cfu/g to 9 log(10) cfu/g during the process while the yeast load increased from 3 log(10) cfu/g at the onset of the fermentation to 5-6 log(10) cfu/g at the end of the fermentation. a total of 168 isolates (31 ab, 88 lab, and 49 yeasts) were isolated and identified by means of phenotypic tests, pcr-based methods and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the aerobic bacteria were mostly  identified as belonging to the bacillus cereus group (71%). the b. cereus isolates lacked the genetic determinant specific for cereulide producers but harboured several genes encoding the heat-labile toxins hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic enterotoxin as detected by pcr. the other aerobic bacteria isolated  were gram negative and identified as klebsiella pneumoniae and pantoea agglomerans. the dominant lab were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (42% of  lab isolates) followed by lactobacillus plantarum (30%) and weissella confusa (18%). seven isolates remained unidentified and constitute probably a novel lab species. the predominant yeast species associated with lafun fermentation were saccharomyces cerevisiae (22% of yeast isolates), pichia scutulata (20%), kluyveromyces marxianus (18%), hanseniaspora guilliermondii (12%), pichia rhodanensis (8%) and candida glabrata (8%) as well as pichia kudriavzevii, candida tropicalis and trichosporon asahii at lower incidence (<5% each).

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == the influence of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. a potassium salt of cla (cla-k) was tested  against three gram-positive strains ( bacillus cereus , staphylococcus aureus , and streptococcus mutans ) and five gram-negative strains ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , salmonella typhimurium , vibrio parahemolyticus , klebsiella pneumoniae , and proteus mirabilis ). cla-k-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the gram-positive strains. the ic(50) value of cla-k was 0.3 mm for b. cereus, 1.2 mm for s. aureus, and 0.3 mm  for s. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mm for k. pneumoniae, 1.2 mm for p. aeruginosa, 1.8 mm for s. typhimurium, 1.8 mm for v. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mm  for p. mirabilis. the cla-k delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower cla-k concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. all cells grown in the medium containing cla-k contained cla in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in gram-positive than gram-negative strains. higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (ldh), protein content, and malondialdehyde (mda) content  were evident in gram-positive strains than in gram-negative strains. these results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by cla mediated through the lipid peroxidation of cla in the membranes and in the medium.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  == although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates  produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. after being treated with manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of pichia pastoris was slightly affected. microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and  loss of cell mobility. viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial  colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed e. coli and b. subtilis cells. under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the gram-negative bacteria (e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the gram-positive bacteria  (bacillus cereus, b. subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) were killed. in the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (dhi) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than l-dopa, n-acetyldopamine  (nada) or n-beta-alanyldopamine (nbad) did, suggesting that dhi and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. the antifungal activity of dhi was detected using p. pastoris, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida albicans, and beauveria bassiana. these results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (dce)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.

AB  == background: in general the bacterial count in freshly donated blood is low and even lower in the corresponding platelet concentrates (pcs). by use of flow cytometry (facs) for sterility testing, the reliability of early versus later sampling times was evaluated. study design and methods: blood donations were spiked with various numbers of staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the corresponding pcs were prepared by the buffy-coat method and stored at 22 degrees c. a 20-ml sample was collected from each pc directly after preparation and after 8 hours. samples were stored at 35 degrees c. sterility testing of both pcs and samples was by facs analysis at different time points. results: all stored pcs were found positive by facs analysis, with detection times ranging between 8 and 24 hours (k. pneumoniae, b.  cereus), 8 and 91 hours (s. aureus), and 144 hours (s. epidermidis). in the samples incubated at 35 degrees c, bacteria were detected after 8 to 19 hours (k. pneumoniae, b. cereus), 8 to 67 hours (s. aureus), and 19 to 43 hours (s. epidermidis). some of the samples did not contain bacteria. conclusion: detection times for slow-growing bacteria are significantly shortened when pc samples are incubated at 35 degrees c: the numbers of bacteria in freshly prepared pcs may, however, be so low that the samples drawn for sterility testing do not contain a  single bacterium. our results do not support a shortening of the 24-hour or greater sampling time recommended by the manufacturers of established test systems, because also for consistent detection by facs, bacteria need to grow in  the pcs to sufficient numbers.

TI  == identification of nif genes in n2-fixing bacterial strains isolated from rice fields along the yangtze river plain.
AB  == the aim of this research was to identify nifh and nifhdkye ' genes in twenty strains of n2-fixing heterotrophic bacteria isolated from rice fields in the yangtze river plain. southern hybridization of the total dna from each strain was performed with the klebsiella pneumoniae nifhdkye ' gene probe (6.2 kb eco ri fragment from psa30) and the azospirillum brasilense nifh gene probe (0.6 kb eco  ri-hin diii fragment from phu8). we found that eco ri fragments of total dna from aeromonas hydrophila hy2, bacillus azotoformans fd, bacillus licheniformis nch1,  nch5, wh4, bacillus brevis nc2, bacillus pumilus nc12, bacillus cereus nch2, citrobacter freundii hy5, hy9, derxia gummosa hz5, pseudomonas mendocina hz1 and  pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes wh3 were positively hybridized with both of the probes. agrobacterium radiobacter hy17, corynebacterium sp. hy12, yz and pseudomonas sp. hy11 had eco ri fragments hybridized with the k. pneumoniae nifhdkye ' gene probe. an eco ri fragment of total dna from bacillus megaterium yy4 was positively hybridized to the a. brasilense nifh gene probe. no hybridization sign was found in the total dna fragments from alcaligenes cupidus  yy6 and corynebacterium sp. nc11 hybridized with either of the gene probes. the data provide the number and size of ecori fragments of the total dna hybridized with the nif gene probes for these strains of rarely studied species, suggesting  additional evidence for n2 fixing and nif gene diversity of n2-fixing bacteria in rice fields along the yangtze river plain.

TI  == basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  == background: flow cytometry (facs) is a common technique in blood banking. it is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. it was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (pcs).  study design and methods: plasma-reduced pcs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees c for various times. the following 10 species were used: bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, and yersinia enterocolitica. bacterial dna was stained with thiazole orange. after the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by facs. results: all bacteria species used were detectable by facs. the lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microl, that is, 10(5) per ml. in general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. in one  case (k. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with  that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. when pc samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per ml of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees c, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. exceptions were e. cloacae and p. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. at 20 to 24 degrees c, the detection times were strongly prolonged. conclusion: sterility testing of pcs by facs is a feasible approach. the present  data suggest incubating pc samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees c before testing. for slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1  to 2 days.

TI  == differential activity of a lectin from solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

TI  == characterization of the nadh-linked acetylacetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase gene from bacillus cereus yuf-4.
AB  == a 1.4-kbp dna fragment, including the nadh-linked acetylacetoin reductase/2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (aacrii/bdh) gene from the chromosomal dna of bacillus cereus yuf-4, was cloned in escherichia coli dh5alpha after its insertion into puc119, and the resulting plasmid was named paacrii119. the aacrii/bdh gene had an open reading frame consisting of 1047 bp encoding 349 amino acids. the enzyme exhibited not only aacr activity, but also bdh activity.  however, the gene was not located in a 2,3-butanediol (bd) operon, as is the case in the bdh gene of klebsiella pneumoniae and that of k. terrigena. in addition, there was no bd-cycle-related enzyme gene in the region surrounding the aacrii/bdh gene. the aacr and bdh activities in e. coli dh5alpha/paacrii119 were  200-fold higher than those in the original b. cereus yuf-4. the characteristics of the aacrii/bdh from e. coli dh 5alpha/paacrii119 are similar to those of the aacrii/bdh from b. cereus yuf-4. the aacrii/bdh was considered to belong to the nad(p)- and zinc-dependent long-chain alcohol dehydrogenase (group i adh) family  on the basis of the following distinctive characteristics: it possessed 14 strictly conserved residues of microbial group i adh and consisted of about 350 amino acids. the enzymatic and genetic characteristics of aacrii/bdh were completely different from those of bdhs belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. these findings indicated that the aacrii/bdh could be considered a new type of bdh.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == the composition, geographical variation and antimicrobial activity of lippia javanica (verbenaceae) leaf essential oils.
AB  == lippia javanica is widely distributed throughout south africa where it is used extensively in traditional herbal preparations. an infusion of the leaves is commonly used as a decongestant for colds and coughs. a preliminary study indicated that the essential oil chemistry varies dramatically both within and between natural plant populations. as the antimicrobial activity may be directly  related to the specific composition of the oil, the activity may also fluctuate.  the aerial parts of lippia javanica were collected from various localities in southern africa to study the essential oil composition and the antimicrobial activity thereof. the hydrodistilled essential oils were analysed by gc/ms and a  cluster analysis was performed on the essential oil dataset. from 16 samples (representing five natural populations), 5 chemotypes were identified; a myrcenone rich-type (36-62%), a carvone rich-type (61-73%), a piperitenone rich-type (32-48%), an ipsenone rich-type (42-61%) and a linalool rich-type (>65%). the myrcenone and linalool chemotypes have been mentioned in the literature but the carvone, ipsenone and piperitenone chemotypes have not previously been reported for lippia javanica. time kill studies were performed on three microbial respiratory isolates to document the scientific rationale of using lippia to treat respiratory complaints in traditional herbal medicine. klebsiella pneumoniae, cryptococcus neoformans and bacillus cereus showed reduction in microbial populations with the strongest bacteriostatic effect observed for klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == [interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == validation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  == background: bacterial detection of platelet (plt)-rich-plasma (prp)-derived plts  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. this study validated the bact/alert for use in testing pooled prp-derived plts with nine contaminating organisms. study design and methods: isolates of bacillus cereus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two prp-derived plt pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 cfus/ml). four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 ml was plated onto blood agar. results: all organisms (excluding p. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respective). p. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively). with e. cloacae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. this was most notable with s. viridans where  the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 cfus/ml, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. conclusions: this study validates the use of the bact/alert system for the detection of bacteria in prp-derived plts in a pooled format. overall, the use of the bact/alert system allowed the detection of pooled prp-derived plts inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 cfus per ml in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding p. acnes).

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  == bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. it is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several  bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals. in this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of  ahl-producing and ahl-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. we showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to p. aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans, produced ahl signals. we also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., agrobacterium tumefaciens xj01, bacillus cereus xj08, and ralstonia sp. xj12, expressed ahl degradation enzymes. furthermore, we showed that p. aeruginosa isolate hl43 was virulent against animal model caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than p. aeruginosa strains pa01 and pa14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. these data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.

TI  == recent developments in carbapenems.
AB  == carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics characterised by the presence of a beta-lactam ring with a carbon instead of sulfone in the 4-position of the thyazolidinic moiety. the first carbapenem to be utilised in therapy was imipenem, the n-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin. imipenem is coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of human renal dehydropeptidase i, as imipenem is hydrolysed by this enzyme. meropenem was the first carbapenem with a 1-beta-methyl group and 2-thio pyrrolidinyl moiety, which renders this antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase i. other carbapenems for parenteral administration later discovered include biapenem, panipenem, ertapenem, lenapenem, e-1010, s-4661 and bms-181139. carbapenems which are orally administered include sanfetrinem, dz-2640, cs-834 and gv-129606. carbapenems have an ultra-broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and stability to almost all clinically relevant beta-lactamases. this differentiates them from all other currently available classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. however, class b beta-lactamases, along with some rare class a and d enzymes, are able to hydrolyse these antibiotics. although class b enzymes are generally chromosomally-encoded (isolated from stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp., bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, flavobacterium spp. and legionella gormanii), plasmid-metallo-beta-lactamases now are appearing in b. fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and members of enterobacteriaceae such as serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of these enzymes compared to the number of other beta-lactamase types is still low, however, it is likely that they will spread due to the increased selective pressure of carbapenem use. the very broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity associated with a good clinical efficacy and a favourable safety profile makes the carbapenems valuable as 'first-line' antibiotics in initial empirical therapy for the treatment of severe infections.

TI  == growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  == background: recent reports from europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. to assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. study design and methods: quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) cfu/ml) by day of storage. results: all examples of b. cereus, p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and s. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per ml by day 3 after inoculation. by day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) cfu per ml. units contaminated with s. epidermidis showed slower and more varied  growth. by day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) cfu per ml. by day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) cfu per  ml. conclusion: these experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) cfu per ml on day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. it would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.

AB  == resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. we have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, 22 staphylococcus aureus, 6 enterococcus faecalis and 1 bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. the strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. the minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. mics were determined by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) on mueller hinton agar. the mics of appropriate american type culture collection control strains were determined. based on the interpretative criteria of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (usa), 87 per cent of gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. two isolates (1 e. coli and 1 klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. the spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.

TI  == microbial communities of printing paper machines.
AB  == the microbial content of printing paper machines, running at a temperature of 45-50 degrees c and at ph 4.5-5, was studied. bacteria were prevalent colonizers  of the machine wet end and the raw materials. a total of 390 strains of aerobic bacteria were isolated and 86% of these were identified to genus and species by biochemical, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic methods. the most common bacteria found at the machine wet end were bacillus coagulans and other bacillus species,  burkholderia cepacia, ralstonia pickettii, and in pink slimes, accumulating in the wire area and press section, species of deinococcus, aureobacterium and brevibacterium. paper-making chemicals also contained species of aureobacterium,  b. cereus, b. licheniformis, b. sphaericus, bordetella, hydrogenophaga, klebsiella pneumoniae, pantoea agglomerans, pseudomonas stutzeri, staphylococcus  and sometimes other enteric bacteria, but these did not colonize the process water. yeasts and moulds were not present in significant numbers. a total of 131  strains were tested for their potential to degrade paper-making raw materials; 91 strains were found to have degradative activity, mainly species of burkholderia and ralstonia, sphingomonas and bacillus, and enterobacteria produced enzymes which degraded paper-making chemicals. stainless steel adhering strains occurred  in slimes and wire water and were identified as burkholderia cepacia, b. coagulans and deinococcus geothermalis. coloured slimes were formed on the machine by species of deinococcus, acinetobacter and methylobacterium (pink), aureobacterium, pantoea and ralstonia (yellowish) and microbulbifer-related strains (brown). the impact of the strains and species found in the printing paper machine community on the technical quality of paper, machine operation, and as a potential biohazard (hazard group 2 bacteria), is discussed.

TI  == rapid identification of bacterially contaminated platelets using reagent strips:  glucose and ph analysis as markers of bacterial metabolism.
AB  == background: one in every 1000 units of platelets is bacterially contaminated, which puts patients at risk for transfusion-associated sepsis and death. however, there is currently no screening test in place to detect contaminated units. the use of commercially available multiple-reagent urine dipsticks for this purpose was evaluated. study design and methods: platelet concentrates were inoculated with either sterile saline or suspensions of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, or serratia marcescens to a final concentration of 50 colony-forming units (cfu) per ml. the  platelets were analyzed daily by the use of multiple-reagent strips, quantitative culture, and glucometry. results: b cereus grew rapidly, reaching 10(7) cfu per ml 1 day after inoculation, while s. epidermidis grew slowly, achieving similar concentration 4 to 6 days after inoculation. two of 10 dipstick reagents, glucose and ph, proved useful in detecting bacteria. both were lower in bacterially contaminated units than in controls. glucose data obtained from automated analyzers validated the dipstick data. all organisms were detected at concentrations > or = 10(7) cfu per ml, and s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were detected in the range of 10(3) to 10(5) cfu per ml. conclusion: the multiple-reagent test used had a sensitivity and specificity of 95 percent (> or  = 10(7) cfu/ml) and 98 to 100 percent, respectively. these data indicate that urine dipsticks can be used to rapidly and inexpensively detect bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates, which potentially will reduce morbidity and mortality at minimal cost.

TI  == inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
AB  == ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per  ml. staphylococcus aureus and lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. for gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and xanthomonas maltophilia, mics were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. the microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. b. cereus and saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. however, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding mics. the disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.

AB  == this study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. these include 56 paucibacillary (pb) and 73 multibacillary (mb) cases.  thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. the non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically pb leprosy (tt/bt/i) patients were: (1) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus aureus(1), staphylococcus  albus(1); (b) gram-positive bacilli: bacillus subtilis(1), corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(1), proteus mirabilis(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). the isolates from clinically mb leprosy (bb/bl/ll) patients were: (a) gram-positive cocci: micrococci(1), staphylococcus aureus(1) and staphylococcus albus(1); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1); corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1). (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(2), klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and proteus mirabilis(2). the specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. these were (a) gram-positive cocci: staphylococcus albus(2), staphylococcus aureus(2) and micrococci(2); (b) gram-positive bacilli: corynebacterium xerosis(1), bacillus subtilis(2), corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and bacillus cereus(1); (c) gram-negative bacilli: escherichia coli(3), proteus vulgaris(1) and proteus mirabilis(1). while these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and pb/mb types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out  subtypes if any.

TI  == kinetic and physical studies of beta-lactamase inhibition by a novel penem, brl 42715.
AB  == the interactions of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus i, tem, klebsiella pneumoniae k1 and enterobacter cloacae p99 beta-lactamases with the novel penem inhibitor brl 42715 were investigated kinetically and, in some cases, by electrospray mass spectrometry (e.s.m.s.). all the beta-lactamases were rapidly inactivated by brl 42715, with second-order rate constants ranging from 0.17 to 6.4 microm-1.s-1. the initial stoichiometry of beta-lactamase inhibition was essentially 1:1, with the exception of the k1 enzyme. in this instance about 20 molecules of brl 42715 were hydrolysed before the enzyme was completely inhibited. inhibited beta-lactamases did not readily regain activity in the absence of brl 42715, the half-lives for regeneration of free enzyme ranging from 5 min for the k1 beta-lactamase to over 2 days for the staphylococcal enzyme. recovery of activity was incomplete for tem-1, k1 and p99 beta-lactamases, suggesting partitioning of the inhibited enzymes to give a permanently (or at least very stable) inactivated species. examination of the interactions of the penem with tem, b. cereus i and p99 beta-lactamases by e.s.m.s. also showed rapid and stoichiometric binding of the inhibitor. in all cases a mass increase of 264  da over the native enzyme was observed, corresponding to the molecular mass of brl 42715, showing that no fragmentation of the penem occurred on reaction with the beta-lactamases.

TI  == relationship between selected bacteria and the growth of immature house flies, musca domestica, in an axenic test system.
AB  == to investigate the relationship between immature (maggot) house flies, musca domestica, and bacteria, we compared the development of sterile first-instar maggots in each of 10 pure blood agar cultures of bacteria with growth on sterile blood agar (negative control) and on standard house fly rearing medium (positive  control). nine species of bacteria representing gram-negative and gram-positive rods, coccoid, and micrococcoid cell types supported house fly growth on blood agar. one bacterium, a strain of bacillus cereus, inhibited maggot growth. the percent pupation for maggots that developed in the presence of eight of nine bacteria (range, 41-69%), was significantly greater than in sterile blood agar (0-5%), and did not differ significantly from maggot growth in the rearing medium (50-90%). average pupal weight for maggots that developed on blood agar with bacteria ranged from 19 to 21 mg, a reflection of favorable growth conditions. average pupal weight in the presence of three bacteria (19.9, 19.4, and 19.4 mg)  was significantly less than respective pupal weights in house fly rearing medium  (24.0, 22.3, and 22.1 mg), but there was no difference in average pupal weight with six bacteria and the house fly rearing medium. these findings illustrate that bacteria or their metabolic products are essential as nutrients for house fly maggot growth in blood agar; a wide variety of adventitious bacteria can contribute to the suitability of an organic substrate for maggot growth; and a naturally occurring isolate of b. cereus limits house fly maggot growth in blood  agar, a relationship that has not been reported previously.

TI  == what do beta-lactamases mean for clinical efficacy?
AB  == beta-lactamases have proved to be extremely important in influencing therapy with penicillins and cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species. both plasmid mediated beta-lactamases which are primarily  of a constitutive penicillinase type and the inducible chromosomal enzymes which  are primarily cephalosporinases are important. the use of penicillins to treat haemophilus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella, salmonella, shigella and pseudomonas infections must be based upon the relative incidence of  beta-lactamase producing strains. in the same manner cephalosporins can be used to treat infections due to enterobacter, serratia and bacteroides only if the compounds are beta-lactamase stable and not good inducers of beta-lactamase activity. although altered permeability is important in the resistance of some pseudomonas and enterobacter to beta-lactams, the resistance really is due to a combination of reduced entry of molecules and strategically placed beta-lactamases. it is only in some streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis strains that altered penicillin-binding proteins make a significant contribution to the resistance to beta-lactams. beta-lactamases will continue to be the most important factor in clinically significant resistance of bacteria to both penicillins and cephalosporins.
