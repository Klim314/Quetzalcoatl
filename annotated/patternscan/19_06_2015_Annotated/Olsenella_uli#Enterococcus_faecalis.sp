TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == response to alkaline stress by root canal bacteria in biofilms.
AB  == aim: to determine whether bacteria isolated from infected root canals survive alkaline shifts better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures. methodology: clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus paracasei, olsenella uli, streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, s. oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum  in biofilm and planktonic cultures were stressed at ph 10.5 for 4 h, and cell viability determined using the fluorescent staining live/dead baclight bacterial  viability kit. in addition, proteins released into extracellular culture fluids were identified by western blotting. results: enterococcus faecalis, l. paracasei, o. uli and s. gordonii survived in high numbers in both planktonic cultures and in biofilms after alkaline challenge. s. anginosus, s. oralis and f. nucleatum showed increased viability in biofilms compared with planktonic cultures. alkaline exposure caused all planktonic cultures to aggregate into clusters and resulted in a greater extrusion of cellular proteins compared with cells in biofilms. increased levels of dnak, hpr and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were observed in culture fluids, especially amongst streptococci. conclusions: in general, bacteria isolated from infected roots canals resisted alkaline stress better in biofilms than in planktonic cultures, however, planktonic cells appeared to use aggregation and the extracellular transport of specific proteins as survival mechanisms.
