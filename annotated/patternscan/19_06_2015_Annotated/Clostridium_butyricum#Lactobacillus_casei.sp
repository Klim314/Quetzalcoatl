TI  == glucose but not polypeptone reduces the effect of probiotic preparations to stimulate carbohydrate breakdown and reduce net ammonia production by pig cecal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == probiotic preparations are used to prevent or treat diarrhea. probiotic preparations increase the in vitro breakdown of carbohydrates and decrease that of protein by mixed cecal bacteria in the absence of readily fermentable materials. diarrhea can increase the influx of readily digestible materials into  the large intestine. therefore, we compared production of organic acids and ammonia in batch cultures using pig cecal contents with or without probiotic preparations (clostridium butyricum, lactobacillus casei plus bifidobacterium breve, or l. casei plus enterococcus faecalis) and with or without readily fermentable substrates (glucose or polypeptone). effects of additional substrates appeared earlier than those of probiotic preparations. both probiotic preparations and glucose increased the production of most short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid but decreased those of ammonia and isovaleric acid. effects of probiotic preparations and glucose were not additive. effects of different preparations were alike. polypeptone increased the production of ammonia and isovaleric acid independent of probiotic preparations. effects of probiotics and  glucose may be to provide either energy or carbon to the microbial ecosystem. effects of glucose were probably mediated through their direct utilization by indigenous bacteria.

TI  == probiotic bacteria stimulate gut epithelial cell proliferation in rat.
AB  == probiotics are used for various intestinal diseases. however, their effects on gut epithelial cell proliferation have not been investigated. we administered 10(7) colony-forming units of lactobacillus casei or clostridium butyricum, or no probiotics (control) by gastric intubation once a day for seven days to rats fed  an elemental diet. we estimated the crypt cell production rate of the jejunum, ileum, cecum, and distal colon. we also quantified cecal bacteria. both probiotics increased the crypt cell production rate of the jejunum and ileum by 25-40%, of the cecum by 70%, and of the distal colon by more than 200% compared with control. only minor variance in the cecal bacterial composition existed among the three groups. probiotics enhanced gut epithelial cell proliferation in  rats fed an elemental diet.

TI  == increased growth of bifidobacterium and eubacterium by germinated barley foodstuff, accompanied by enhanced butyrate production in healthy volunteers.
AB  == germinated barley foodstuff (gbf) derived from the aleurone and scutellum fractions of germinated barley mainly consists of low-lignified hemicellulose and glutamine-rich protein. gbf improves the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells and defecation, through the bacterial production of short chain fatty acids (scfa), especially butyrate. in this study we investigated the mechanism of production of butyrate by microflora in humans and in vitro. daily administration of 9 g gbf for 14 successive days significantly increased fecal butyrate content. fecal bifidobacterium and eubacterium were also significantly increased by gbf administration in healthy volunteers. ten anaerobic micro-organisms selected from intestinal microflora were cultured in vitro in the medium containing gbf as a sole carbon source (gbf medium). after a 3-day incubation, 7 strains (bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, bacteroides ovatus, clostridium butyricum, and  eubacterium limosum) lowered the medium ph producing scfa. eubacterium grown together with bifidobacterium in gbf medium efficiently produced butyrate. on the other hand, gbf changed the intestinal microflora and increased probiotics such as bifidobacterium in the intestinal tract. as a result, butyrate was produced by the mutual action of eubacterium and bifidobacterium. this butyrate is considered to enhance the proliferation of colonic epithelial cells.
