TI  == comparing the efficacy of hyper-pure chlorine-dioxide with other oral antiseptics on oral pathogen microorganisms and biofilm in vitro.
AB  == this study examines the antibacterial properties of sodium hypochlorite (naocl),  chlorhexidine gluconate (chx), listerine(r), and high purity chlorine dioxide (solumium, clo2) on selected common oral pathogen microorganisms and on dental biofilm in vitro. antimicrobial activity of oral antiseptics was compared to the  gold standard phenol. we investigated streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, veillonella alcalescens, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and candida albicans as some important representatives of the oral pathogens. furthermore, we collected dental plaque from the upper first molars of healthy young students. massive biofilm was formed in vitro and its reduction was measured after treating it with mouthrinses: chx,  listerine(r) or hyper pure clo2. their biofilm disrupting effect was measured after dissolving the crystal violet stain from biofilm by photometer. the results have showed that hyper pure clo2 solution is more effective than other currently  used disinfectants in case of aerobic bacteria and candida yeast. in case of anaerobes its efficiency is similar to chx solution. the biofilm dissolving effect of hyper pure clo2 is significantly stronger compared to chx and listerine(r) after 5 min treatment. in conclusion, hyper pure clo2 has a potent disinfectant efficacy on oral pathogenic microorganisms and a powerful biofilm dissolving effect compared to the current antiseptics, therefore high purity clo2 may be a new promising preventive and therapeutic adjuvant in home oral care and  in dental or oral surgery practice.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == endocarditis in a large district general hospital: a study of the microbiological spectrum between 2000 and 2011.
AB  == infective endocarditis is one of three common cardiac infections in the united kingdom, in addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, with a reported incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 patient years. infective endocarditis can often have serious consequences and a wide variety of organisms may be the causative pathogen. there are little published data regarding the exact spectrum of organisms that cause endocarditis in the united kingdom and whether organisms such as streptococci still dominate. in the present study, all cases of endocarditis at the authors' institution, representing a typical nontertiary centre, were retrospectively examined and audited to provide a snapshot of the organism spectrum in these patients. the cases of more than 120 patients who were coded as having endocarditis by the institution's clinical coding department during the period between december 2000 and january 2011 were examined. microbiological tests and clinical case notes of all patients were reviewed. of the 101 patients diagnosed with and treated for endocarditis, 64 were male, with  a mean age of 60.57 years. the most common organisms identified were streptococcus species (31%), staphylococcus aureus (27%) and enterococcus faecalis (21%). the organisms with the highest associated mortality rate were s aureus and the 'other organism' group, which included non-hacek group (haemophilus species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella species) pathogens such as candida albicans. streptococcus species and s aureus remain the main cause of endocarditis in a typical hospital setting in the united kingdom, although in a smaller proportion of cases than historical data suggests. overall, mortality remains high, and the clinician should remain vigilant to endocarditis in any patient with a positive blood culture because the number of cases of endocarditis caused by less typical organisms are increasing.

TI  == identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical acinetobacter junii and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.
