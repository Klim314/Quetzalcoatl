TI  - Periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. Previously described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. This is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. CASE PRESENTATION: The intraoral examination of a 17-year-old Turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. Alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. Clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. Periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). A strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. The reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. Intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and tooth mobility class I and II. Furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Treponema denticola after therapy. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. This case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.
TI  - Combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. DESIGN: Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the Etest. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. RESULTS: Synergy, i.e. FICI values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two A. actinomycetemcomitans (FICI: 0.3), two F. nucleatum (FICI: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one E. corrodens (FICI: 0.4) isolates. Indifference, i.e. FIC indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 P. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. Microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by Etest. CONCLUSION: Combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and E. corrodens. Synergy was shown for a few strains only.
TI  - Efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  - AIM: To assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (BOMP)]. After retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, BOMP and stain indexes), a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (CPC mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. Subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were included in the analysis. At 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). At 6 months, the mean BOMP values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). Changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and BOMP (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. A microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for Prevotella intermedia. CONCLUSION: The evaluated 0.07% CPC-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to the placebo, for at least 6 months.
TI  - The association between detectable plasmatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and different subgingival microorganisms in Brazilian adults with HIV: a multilevel analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigates the association between detectable plasmatic  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load (HVL) and high levels of periodontal- and non-periodontal-related microorganisms in the subgingival microbiota of individuals with HIV. METHODS: Thirty-seven individuals with HIV were divided into two groups: 1) detectable HVL (n = 15); and 2) undetectable HVL (n = 22). Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained, and the levels of 35 microbial species were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Periodontal clinical measures and laboratory and sociodemographic data were also registered. chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare groups. Multilevel ordinal regression models were used to test the association between HVL and the levels of 35 microbial species in subgingival biofilm, adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Of the 35 species studied, 11 (31.4%) showed higher mean levels in the detectable HVL group than undetectable HVL group (P <0.001). These species included Actinomyces naeslundii II, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter concisus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Candida albicans. Significant associations between detectable HVL and high levels of microorganisms, adjusted for confounders, were observed for A. naeslundii I, Actinomyces gerencseriae, C. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythia, and Dialister pneumosintes. CONCLUSION: Detectable plasmatic HVL in individuals with HIV was associated with elevated levels of known periodontal pathogens, such as P. nigrescens, T. forsythia, and E. corrodens, as well as C. concisus, C. gingivalis, and D. pneumosintes in the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota from Cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  - This present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the Cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the Tufted Capuchin Monkey Procreation Center (Sao Paulo State University - UNESP) or free-ranging monkeys. For this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. The primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to VMGA III transport medium and ultrapure water. The microbiota was cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial DNA was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using PCR and real-time PCR. The actinomycetes, fusobacteria, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic rods, Tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Dialister pneumosintes and Prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas Treponema denticola was not found. Populations of C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.
TI  - A microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. METHODS: Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Tannerella forsythia, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria mucosa, Campylobacter gracilis, and Prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp space cases they were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, N. mucosa, E. faecalis, E. saburreum, C. gracilis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Counts of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Campylobacter sputigena, Capnocytophaga showae, Treponema socrenskii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp space cases.
TI  - Distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. DESIGN: Dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in Okayama, Japan, in 2011. Bacterial DNA was extracted from each specimen and PCR analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas gulae, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens were performed. RESULTS: P. gulae (71.2%), T. forsythia (77.3%), and C. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. P. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. Furthermore, E. corrodens and T. denticola in specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.
TI  - Molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in Japan.
AB  - Periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. The distribution of an animal gingival organism Porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. Porphyromonas gulae, Tannerella forsythia and Campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. Then, isolation and identification of the Porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. There were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were Porphyromonas gulae. In contrast, the frequency of Porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. These findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially Porphyromonas gulae.
TI  - Early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. However, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately after professional cleaning. Samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The percentage of DNA probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. Ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. RESULTS: Succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. At 1 d, Streptococcus mitis and Neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula and Streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. At 4-7 d, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella nigrescens became elevated. Subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. Increased proportions were first observed for S. mitis, followed by V. parvula and C. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by Capnocytophaga sputigena and P. nigrescens. No significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. CONCLUSION: There is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.
TI  - Microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and 13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. Subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (T1), and 1 week (T2), 3 months (T3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (T4). DNA was extracted from the samples, and the 16S rRNA-based PCR detection method was used to determine the prevalence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Campylobactor rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. RESULTS: The frequency of T forsythia, C rectus, and P nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. For the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. The frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at T1 but newly developing at T2, T3, and T4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. CONCLUSION: The placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - Identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (CP), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. DESIGN: Nineteen patients with CP without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with CP and CKD who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with CP and CKD who were on renal replacement therapy (RRT group) were examined. The severity of CP was based on the investigation of probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL). The definition and stage of CKD were based on the criteria proposed by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative of the National Kidney Foundation. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the equation of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Candida albicans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on RRT and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. CP was more severe in patients with CKD. A strong association was observed between the frequency of C. albicans (P = 0.056), P.gingivalis (P = 0.008), T. denticola (P = 0.013) and CAL, when CKD patients were compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: CP is more severe and is associated with increased frequency of C. albicans, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in patients with CKD.
TI  - Detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  - To culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. Micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus (HAIN Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) tests are two commercially available rapid PCR-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. In this study, we compared these commercial PCR-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. A total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. Aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. The overall agreement between both methods was excellent for Eubacterium nodatum, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for Capnocytophaga sp, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra (Micromonas micros), and Campylobacter rectus (86-78%). Discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i P. intermedia/Prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. Nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. Subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (T1), and 3 months after appliance removal (T2). DNA was extracted from the samples and the 16S rRNA-based PCR detection method was used to determine the prevalence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , Tannerella forsythia , Campylobacter rectus , Eikenella corrodens , Porphyromonas gingivalis , Prevotella intermedia , Prevotella nigrescens , and Treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. RESULTS: The frequency of positive sites at T1 and T2 was 65% and 43.3% for C. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for E. corrodens , respectively. For the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between times. CONCLUSION: Periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. However, how long it takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.
TI  - [Subgingival microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis in Bogota, Colombia: an epidemiological approach].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis-associated microbiotas differ in regions around the world and vary with a variety of factors. This suggests that each country must establish its own dental microbiobiotic profile in order to formulate adequate prevention measures and more specific treatments. OBJECTIVE: The prevalence and proportions of the following microorganisms were investigated: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, Micromonas micros, Fusobacterium spp, Dialister pneumosintes and enteric rods. The patients selected had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis from clinical populations in Bogota, Colombia. The variables of age, gender and socioeconomic level were included in the comparisons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 183 patients were classified in two groups, chronic periodontitis (n=84) and aggressive periodontitis (n=59); 40 healthy subjects were selected for comparison. A pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the 6 deepest periodontal pockets in every patient and processed by culture for the isolation and identification of bacteria. RESULTS: In chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis, P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, C. rectus, Fusobacterium spp and E. corrodens showed high and similar prevalence, whereas M. micros, A. actinomycetemcomitans, D. pneumosintes and enteric rods (commonly from the tribe Klebsielleae) showed less and similar prevalence. In the healthy group, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, C. rectus and Fusobacterium spp showed high frequency whereas M. micros and E. corrodens showed moderate frequency. CONCLUSIONS: Porphyromonas gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, C. rectus, Fusobacterium spp. and E. corrodens are important constituents of the microbiologic profile of the periodontitis in Colombian populations. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found more frequently than A. actinomycetemcomitans in aggressive periodontitis.
TI  - Microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. METHODS: Ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. Subsequently, a period of 21 days of washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. Microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: The species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were Prevotella melaninogenica and Veillonella parvula. The mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). Proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and P. melaninogenica. CONCLUSION: The tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.
TI  - Sampling strategy for intraoral detection of periodontal pathogens before and following periodontal therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify a sampling strategy with high probability for detecting oral colonization by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Tannerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, and Treponema denticola before and following mechanical periodontal therapy. METHODS: Samples were taken from the following intraoral sites in 35 patients with untreated chronic periodontitis before and 1.5, 3, and 6 months after non-surgical periodontal therapy: supra- and subgingival plaque from the deepest pockets in each sextant; pooled supra- and subgingival plaque from another six randomly selected, less affected teeth; mucosal swab samples from the tongue, tonsils, throat, and buccal mucosa; and stimulated and unstimulated saliva. Microbial species were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Of the sampling of all assessed sites, the highest probability for simultaneously detecting the tested pathogens was found in respect to the combination of supra- and subgingival plaque samples taken from the most affected tooth in each sextant in untreated patients (probability: 83% to 95% for the assessed bacteria). These results were consistently observed throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: For determining the intraoral carrier state of patients with periodontitis, a combined sample of supra- and subgingival plaque taken from the deepest periodontal pocket in each sextant may yield the most reliable result. This sampling strategy may be used in routine microbial testing and clinical research.
TI  - Distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria in saliva samples from Japanese children  and their mothers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the distribution of 10 periodontal bacteria species (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Treponema denticola) in children, and then compared their distribution in those children and their mothers, with special attention given to three of the species known as the red complex (P. gingivalis, T. forsythensis, and T. denticola) whose presence has been shown to be associated with conditions related to periodontal diseases. METHODS: One hundred thirteen pairs of children and their mothers were randomly selected from patients treated at the Pedodontic Clinic of Osaka University Dental Hospital. Saliva samples were taken at the second visit prior to receiving professional tooth brushing instruction. Genomic DNA was extracted from each saliva sample, followed by a polymerase chain reaction assay with species-specific sets of primers. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans was the most frequently detected species in the mothers, followed by C. sputigena, P. gingivalis, and T. forsythensis, while C. sputigena had the highest detection rate, followed by A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. denticola in the children. The detection rate of the red complex species in children whose mothers possessed the same species was significantly higher than in those whose mothers did not possess them. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a correlation between the presence of periodontal bacteria in children and their mothers, while the presence of red complex bacteria in children was highly associated with that in their mothers.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a Chilean population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (AgP). Other periodontopathic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in Chilean patients with AgP. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. Samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (CP) patients were taken as controls. Samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (RTF) and cultured. Periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. The identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: AgP showed a significatively higher prevalence of C. rectus than CP (P = 0.036). The only statistical difference found was for C. rectus. Patients with AgP showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. A similar prevalence in both groups of patients was observed for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia/nigrescens, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in AgP than CP patients. In localized AgP, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and P. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized AgP patients who harbored A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: C. rectus, P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of AgP in this Chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between AgP and CP was for C. rectus, suggesting that the differences in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. In this study, the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a Saudi Arabian population.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a Saudi Arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. For each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. The checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Tannerella forsythensis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponoma denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas noxia and Streptococcus intermedius. Two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). RESULTS: The prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. At score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. The depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. When the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. CONCLUSIONS: No major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.
TI  - Severe periodontitis in a 5-year-old girl with hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome.
AB  - The hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) is a multisystem disorder that affects  the: (1) dentition; (2) skeleton; (3) connective tissues; and (4) immune system. Little is known about periodontal manifestations of the syndrome. The purpose of this report was to describe a 5-year-old girl with suspected autosomal-recessive HIES syndrome who revealed profusely bleeding and painful gingiva and generalized aggressive periodontitis. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microbiological examination detected Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella nigrescens, Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, and Campylobacter rectus in the deep periodontitis lesions. The extraction of all deciduous teeth due to a poor prognosis and risk of systemic infection led to resolution of the oral inflammation. Long-term follow-up is required to determine the periodontal prognosis of the erupting permanent teeth.
TI  - Periodontal infections and pre-term low birth weight: a case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pre-term delivery of low-birth-weight infants [pre-term low birth weight (PLBW)] remains a significant public health issue and a major cause of neonatal death and long-term health problems. There is a growing consensus that infections remote from fetal-placental unit may influence PLBW infants. Recent studies have suggested that maternal periodontal disease may be an independent risk factor for PLBW. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible link between periodontal infections and PLBW by means of clinical and microbiological data in post-partum women with low socioeconomic level. METHODS: Clinical periodontal recordings comprising dental plaque, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and gingival recession were performed (six sites/tooth) in a total number of 181 women (53 cases and 128 controls) within 3 days post-partum. Subgingival plaque samples from mesio-or disto-buccal aspect of randomly selected one first molar and one incisor tooth have been obtained by paperpoints and were analysed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization with respect to 12 bacterial species. In all analyses, the individual subject was the computational unit. Thus, mean values for all clinical parameters were calculated and bacterial scores from each individual sample were averaged. Statistical methods included Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test/chi(2) test, and multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The cases have gained significantly less weight during the pregnancy than did the controls (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the cases and controls with regard to the dental and periodontal parameters and the values of clinical periodontal recordings were found to be very similar (p>0.05). Mean and median scores (bacterial loads) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Streptococcus intermedius in the subgingival plaque sampling sites were significantly higher in the controls than in the cases (p<0.05). The occurrence rates of P. intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Selenomonas noxia and S. intermedius were higher in the cases compared with the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). According to the model created by the multiple logistic regression analysis, P. micros and C. rectus were found to significantly increase the risk of PLBW (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively), while P. nigrescens and A. actinomycetemcomitans decreased this risk (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicated that when subgingival bacteria were evaluated together, P. micros and C. rectus may have a role in increasing the risk for PLBW, although no single bacteria exhibited any relation with the risk of PLBW. Further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship between periodontal diseases and PLBW.
TI  - Differences in the subgingival microbiota of Swedish and USA subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. METHOD: One hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (N Sweden=79; USA=79) were recruited. Subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, BOP, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples=4345). % DNA probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. Significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. RESULTS: On average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in Swedish than American subjects: Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); Streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); Eikenella corrodens (1.7, 1.0); Tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and Prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). Leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in American (5.5) than Swedish subjects (3.0). Cluster analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. Twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. Five clusters were dominated by American subjects and 2 clusters by Swedish subjects. Fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the Swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by high proportions of A. naeslundii genospecies 1, Prevotella nigrescens, T. forsythensis and P. melaninogenica. Other clusters were characterized by high proportions of Actinomyces gerencseriae, Veillonella parvula, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Eubacterium saburreum, L. buccalis and Neisseria mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: The microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from Swedish and American subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. The heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the American subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the American subjects sampled.
TI  - Initial antimicrobial effect of controlled-release doxycycline in subgingival sites.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the ability of a 10% doxycycline hyclate controlled-release polymer (Atridox) to suppress periodontopathic bacteria when placed subgingivally following scaling and root planing (Sc/Rp). METHODS: Eight males and seven females, mean age 48 years, with moderate to advanced periodontitis participated in the study. In each patient, bilateral periodontal pockets probing 6-7 mm were randomly assigned to treatment by Sc/Rp + doxycycline polymer or by Sc/Rp alone. Subgingival placement of doxycycline polymer was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sc/Rp was performed with hand instruments for at least 10 min in each study tooth. Subgingival samples were collected by paper-points at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks post-treatment. Culture methodology was used to isolate and identify putative periodontal pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter species, Eubacterium species, Fusobacterium species, Peptostreptococcus micros, Eikenella corrodens, Staphylococcus species, enteric gram-negative rods, beta-hemolytic streptococci and yeasts. The microbiologic examination was carried out blindly. Microbiological data were analyzed using a General Linear Model Analysis of Variance for within and between group effects. RESULTS: Sites receiving Sc/Rp + doxycycline polymer and sites receiving Sc/Rp alone exhibited similar levels of periodontal pathogens at baseline and did not differ significantly in total viable counts and proportional recovery of periodontopathic bacteria post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Controlled-release doxycycline placed in moderate to deep periodontal pockets caused no significant additional reduction in the subgingival pathogenic microbiota compared to thorough Sc/Rp alone. Since controlled-release doxycycline may not significantly suppress several subgingival pathogenic microorganisms and seems to possess no distinct advantage over broad-spectra, safe and inexpensive antiseptics, the rationale for its employment in periodontal therapy remains unclear.
TI  - Microbiological shifts in intra- and extraoral habitats following mechanical periodontal therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to analyze the intra- and extraoral  colonization dynamics of periodontal pathogens following supra- and subgingival debridement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty five patients with chronic periodontitis were enrolled in the study. Supra- and subgingival plaque samples, saliva, and swab samples from mucosa and extraoral sites were taken at baseline and 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after mechanical periodontal therapy. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Eikenella corrodens (Ec), Tannerella forsythensis (Tf), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Prevotella nigrescens (Pn), and Treponema denticola (Td) were identified by PCR. RESULTS: Supra- and subgingival debridement decreased the number of subgingival sites infected with the analyzed pathogens only transiently, if at all. However, the detection frequencies of Tf, Td, Ec, Pi, and Pn in the supragingival region, of Pg, Td, and Pn at the oral mucosa sites (mostly the tongue), and of all pathogens except Aa in saliva increased over the 6-month observation period. Td was the only pathogen recorded in notable quantities in the extraoral habitat (external ear canal). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that supra- and subgingival debridement results in a dissemination of periodontal pathogens within the oral cavity.
TI  - Specific antibiotics in the treatment of periodontitis--a proposed strategy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to propose a strategy for the selection of antibiotics that specifically target complexes of periodontal pathogens present in patients with periodontitis. METHODS: Seven hundred seventy-four (774) patients with various forms of periodontitis were included in the study. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest periodontal pockets in each quadrant using a sterile curet, and pooled. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Tannerella forsythensis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens were identified by polymerase chain reaction, and the prevalence of combinations of these pathogens was determined. To each pathogen complex (PC), i.e., combination of pathogens, those antibiotics were assigned that were most specific according to the published minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values and the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) concentrations achievable in vivo. Antibiotic GCF concentrations had to be at least 10 times the MIC90 values, and the narrowest spectrum was selected with respect to the assessed periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Nine major PCs (each > or = 3% of all patients) were found in 73.4% of all patients, whereas 38 minor PCs (each < 3% of all patients) were distributed in 26.6% of all patients. Ten different antibiotic regimens were found to be specific for the total of 46 PCs; i.e., metronidazole and amoxicillin in 11 PCs (55.0% of all patients), metronidazole and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or metronidazole and ciprofloxacin in 13 PCs (18.9%), amoxicillin in 4 PCs (8.3%), doxycycline in 2 PCs (6.1%), metronidazole in 8 PCs (4.1%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 3 PCs (2.9%), clindamycin in 2 PCs (1.5%), ciprofloxacin in 2 PCs (0.4%), and tetracycline in 1 PC (0.3%). CONCLUSION: The results of the study indicate that there are at least 46 different combinations of the assessed periodontal pathogens in subjects with periodontitis, and at least 10 different antibiotic regimens might be required to specifically target the various pathogen complexes.
TI  - Occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. METHODS: Ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: Capnocytophaga ochracea, C. sputigena, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. P. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. Eikenella corrodens and Campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while Tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. CONCLUSION: A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, P. nigrescens, C. rectus, and E. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial flora of healthy children, whereas P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and T. denticola appear to be transient organisms.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. We assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. METHODS: Plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. Using species-specific primers of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, and Treponema denticola, PCR amplification was performed with bacterial genomic DNA from plaque samples. RESULTS: The results indicated that C. rectus, E. corrodens, A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. ochracea, and C. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while B. forsythus and P. intermedia were detected less frequently, and P. gingivalis and T. denticola were not found. In contrast, the percentage of P. nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. Subject-based analyses suggested that the number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. CONCLUSIONS: The colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. However, colonization by P. gingivalis and T. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.
TI  - The localization of periodontal-disease-associated bacteria in human periodontal  pockets.
AB  - Some Gram-negative anaerobes are associated with the incidence and progression of periodontal disease. In periodontal pockets, however, the localization of those bacteria is unknown. We investigated the localization of 5 bacterial species in human periodontal pockets. Fifteen teeth with a part of periodontal pockets from 10 adult periodontitis patients were obtained, and the localization of bacteria was examined immunohistochemically. Positive reactions with anti-Prevotella nigrescens antibody were located at the epithelium-associated plaque area in the middle pocket zones. In the middle and deep pocket zones, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola were especially localized in the unattached plaque area, but Eikenella corrodens was observed in the tooth-attached plaque area. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, detected in 2 of 15 samples examined, was found in the unattached plaque area, in the middle pocket zone. The present findings indicated that the 5 bacterial species examined localized at distinct regions in human periodontal pockets.
TI  - Susceptibilities of Eikenella corrodens, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens clinical isolates to amoxicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The AB Biodisk Etest showed that 106 (100%) and 98 (92%) isolates of Eikenella corrodens were susceptible to amoxicillin and tetracycline, respectively. Twenty-three (68%) Prevotella intermedia isolates and 14 (67%) Prevotella nigrescens isolates were susceptible to amoxicillin. Seventy-nine percent of the P. intermedia isolates and 67% of the P. nigrescens isolates were susceptible to tetracycline. A higher percentage of beta-lactamase-producing isolates of P. intermedia and P. nigrescens were identified with selective agar containing amoxicillin than with nonselective agar.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of acute periradicular abscesses by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses of endodontic origin by using a molecular genetic method. STUDY DESIGN: Pus was collected by aspiration from 27 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic origin, and DNA was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 49 bacterial species by using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The presence of bacterial DNA in clinical samples was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction with ubiquitous bacterial 16S rRNA gene primers. RESULTS: The results of the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis revealed that 37 of the 49 DNA probes tested were reactive with one or more samples. The number of bacterial species in the pus samples ranged from 1 to 33 (mean, 5.9). Eighteen of the 27 pus samples were positive for at least one DNA probe. The most prevalent species found were: Bacteroides forsythus (29.6% of the cases); Porphyromonas gingivalis (29.6%); Streptococcus constellatus (25.9%), Prevotella intermedia (22.2%), Prevotella nigrescens (22.2%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (18.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum (18.5%), and Eikenella corrodens (18.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiologic data of the present investigation indicated that molecular genetic methods could provide additional knowledge regarding the microbiota of acute periradicular abscesses by detecting bacterial species that are difficult--or even impossible--to grow.
TI  - Treatment of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline. Clinical, microbiological and radiological results.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, microbiological and radiological effects of peri-implantitis therapy by local delivery of tetracycline. In 25 partially edentulous patients, 30 implants with radiographic evidence of circumferential bone loss, and peri-implant probing depths > or =5 mm were treated with polymeric tetracycline HCl-containing fibers. Clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (M) after treatment. Standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline, M3, and one year after treatment. Two patients were discontinued from the study after 180 days because of persisting active peri-implantitis with pus formation. The remaining subjects showed a significant decrease of mean peri-implant probing depth from 6.0 to 4.1 mm (M1, P<0.001), which was maintained over 12 months. In comparison to baseline, the bleeding tendency was significantly reduced after one month, and thereafter (P<0.001). No significant recession of the mucosal margin was noted. The radiologically determined distance from the shoulder of the implant to the bottom of the bony defect decreased slightly, but not significantly, from 5.2 to 4.9 mm. At M1, M3 and M6, mean total anaerobic cultivable bacterial counts were significantly lower than at baseline (P<0.001). A significant decrease in frequency of detection was noted for Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium sp., Bacteroides forsythus, and Campylobacter rectus (P<0.01). Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Eikenella corrodens had very low baseline frequencies that could not be significantly suppressed further. In conclusion, therapy of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline had a positive effect on clinical and microbiological parameters.
TI  - Relationship of periodontopathic bacteria with early-onset periodontitis in Down's syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Down's syndrome (DS) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of DS periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 DS young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (MD). The prevalence of 10 possible periodontopathic bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Campylobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. The detection of P. gingivalis fimA genotypes was also performed in P. gingivalis-positive samples. RESULTS: Although DS subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with MD, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. The profiles of subjects with periodontitis were significant in DS, but not in MD. The prevalence of P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, and P. intermedia were significant in the DS periodontitis group, compared to DS gingivitis group. Moreover, the occurrence of P. gingivalis with the type II fimA gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both DS and MD, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in DS is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including P. gingivalis with type II fimA.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontal pathogens in localized and generalized forms of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  - The primary objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with early-onset periodontitis (EOP) and to evaluate the microbial differences between localized and generalized forms of this periodontal disease condition. Thirty-one females and 11 males with a mean age of 30.3 (s.d. 4.0) years were examined. Seventeen subjects had generalized (GEOP) and 25 had localized early-onset periodontitis (LEOP). Subgingival plaque samples were assayed using PCR which provided subject prevalence data for the pathogens; Bacteroides forsythus 78.6%, Treponema denticola 88.1%, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 19.0%, Porphyromonas gingivalis 16.7%, Prevotella intermedia 40.4%, Prevotella nigrescens 61.9%, Eikenella corrodens 42.3% and Campylobacter rectus 92.8%. Only 3 healthy sites harbored one or more of these periodontal pathogens. Seven of the 8 subjects positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans had LEOP. P. intermedia was present in 58.8% of GEOP compared with 28% of LEOP subjects (p=0.046). At 82.4% of GEOP sites P. nigrescens was present while this bacteria was detected at 52% of LEOP (p=0.044). P. gingivalis was isolated from 22.6% of females but no male subjects (p=0.084). C. rectus was recovered from all female subjects compared to 72.7% of males (p=0.014). A. actinomycetemcomitans (37.5%) and C. rectus (86.5%) were more frequently identified in non-smokers compared to 7.6% and 68.8% of smokers, respectively (p <0.05). Microbial associations coincided with the clinical division of the cases into LEOP and GEOP in 83% of the subjects.
TI  - "Checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum IgG responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). Smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject; 2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic DNA probes. Serum IgG antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. RESULTS: Cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. Corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. Heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). Higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Eubacterium nodatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella parvula, and Actinomyces naeslundii in controls. Cases displayed higher IgG levels against P. gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against F. nucleatum, T. denticola, E. nodatum, and Capnocytophaga ochracea. Positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. In cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species out of which only one was positive (V. parvula). Both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. A logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. Smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. CONCLUSION: A combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.
TI  - Periodontopathic bacteria in children with Down syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely known that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. In this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in DS children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. METHODS: The subjects were 60 DS children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls. Ten pathogens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, P nigrescens, Capnocytophaga ochracea, C. sputigena, Campyrobacter rectus, and Eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. Periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. RESULTS: No significant difference in periodontal status was observed between the DS and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the DS children. B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. nigrescens, and C. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the DS children (P <0.01 or 0.05). The occurrence of P. gingivalis was also significant in the DS subjects over 5 years old. A cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the DS subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of P. gingivalis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of DS patients and maturation of subgingival components, including P. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.
TI  - Microbiological features of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  - Papillon-Lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. The syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. This report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. Clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. In samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr type 1 virus by a nested-PCR detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. Major cultivable bacteria included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), Prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and Peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. nigrescens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Eikenella corrodens were identified by PCR analysis. The patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not A. actinomycetemcomitans. The viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the Papillon-Lefevre syndrome patient. The father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but not Epstein-Barr type 1 virus. We hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with A. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
TI  - Comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (IMP) were received at the Microbiology Testing Laboratory (MTL) of the University of Pennsylvania over a 2-year period. Paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by MTL from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (AP) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (RP). Patients' mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. Samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. Culture was used for detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, P. micros, Capnocytophaga and Fusobacterium sp., enteric Gram-negative rods, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus sp., and yeast. P. gingivalis and B. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. RESULTS: The most frequently detected microorganisms from IMP were B. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), Fusobacterium (41%), P. micros (39%), and P. gingivalis (27%). Recovery levels (mean +/- SD) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. The most frequently detected organisms for AP were B. forsythus (83%), Fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), P. gingivalis (59%), P. micros (51%), and E. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. Corresponding data for RP were B. forsythus (85%), Fusobacterium (83%), P. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), C. rectus (56%), and P. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profile of Papillon-Lefevre patients assessed by DNA-probes.
AB  - The prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridisation in a group of 12 Saudi-Arabian adolescents with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. A total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. The patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. All 12 patients harboured the putative bacterial pathogens P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. micros and S. intermedius while T. denticola, B. forsythus, P. nigrescens, E. corrodens, S. noxia and C. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. P. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for A. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. A number of the investigated species (B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. intermedia, C rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. On the other hand, bacteria such as A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were infrequently encountered at high levels in these subgingival samples. In conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a PLS-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  - This study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. Microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16S rRNA-based PCR identification methods. Streptococcal and Actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. In decreasing order of prevalence, Fusobacterium, enteric rods, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga, Propionibacterium, yeasts, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. The cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. PCR detection showed C. rectus and Eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. In decreasing order of prevalence, PCR identified Treponema denticola, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, and P. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. Tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. It appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.
TI  - "Checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The present study compared the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect to the following species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled DNA probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial test panels. We found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data. If the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. The use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87. The checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. It was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction detection of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of gingivitis and advanced periodontitis lesions.
AB  - A 16S rRNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection method was used to determine the prevalence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia. Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola in subgingival specimens of 50 advanced periodontitis, 50 adult gingivitis and 50 pediatric gingivitis subjects. The optimal PCR conditions were determined for each study species. Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products from each study species revealed a single band of the predicted size. Restriction enzyme digestion of amplicons confirmed the specificity of the amplification. PCR detection limits were in the range of 25-100 cells. No cross-reactivity with other oral micro-organisms or nonspecific amplification was observed. The prevalence by PCR in advanced periodontitis, adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis subjects was 30%, 14% and 14% for A. actinomycetemcomitans, 86%, 18% and 8% for B. forsythus, 74%, 52% and 78% for C. rectus, 80%, 70% and 66% for E. corrodens, 70%, 10% and 14% for P. gingivalis, 58%, 12% and 18% for P. intermedia, 52%, 20% and 22% for P. nigrescens, and 54%, 16% and 16% for T. denticola, respectively. The prevalence was higher in the advanced periodontitis group than in both adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis for A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and T. denticola at P < 0.01, and for E. corrodens at P < 0.05. The prevalence of C. rectus was significantly higher in the advanced periodontitis group than in the adult gingivitis group at P < 0.01. Matching results between PCR and culture occurred in 28% (B. forsythus) to 71% (A. actinomycetemcomitans) of the samples; the major discrepancy occurred in the PCR-positive/culture-negative category. Matching results between PCR and DNA probe methods were found in 84% of the subjects (B. forsythus) and 70% (P. gingivalis). Odds ratio analysis revealed statistically significant positive associations between 17 of the 28 possible combinations (P < 0.01). This study demonstrated the utility of a 16S rRNA-based PCR detection method for identifying important subgingival microorganisms. The results indicated a strong association between the study species and periodontitis. Several previously unreported symbiotic relationships were found between the 8 species tested.
TI  - Heat shock proteins in the human periodontal disease process.
AB  - The production of HSP by periodontopathic Gram-negative bacteria was examined by  SDS-PAGE, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against HSPs. Strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Treponema socranskii species produced HSP which reacted with anti-Yersinia enterocolitica HSP 60 and/or mycobacterial 65-kDA HSP monoclonal antibodies. It found that gingival homogenate samples from patients with adult periodontitis reacted with anti-human HSP were also found in a serum sample from a periodontitis patient. The present study suggests that HSPs are implicated in human periodontal disease process.
