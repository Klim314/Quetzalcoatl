TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - The ClosTron: a universal gene knock-out system for the genus Clostridium.
AB  - Progress in exploiting clostridial genome information has been severely impeded by a general lack of effective methods for the directed inactivation of specific genes. Those few mutants that have been generated have been almost exclusively derived by single crossover integration of a replication-deficient or defective plasmid by homologous recombination. The mutants created are therefore unstable. Here we have adapted a mutagenesis system based on the mobile group II intron from the ltrB gene of Lactococcus lactis (Ll.ltrB) to function in clostridial hosts. Integrants are readily selected on the basis of acquisition of resistance to erythromycin, and are generated from start to finish in as little as 10 to 14 days. Unlike single crossover plasmid integrants, the mutants are extremely stable. The system has been used to make 6 mutants of Clostridium acetobutylicum and 5 of Clostridium difficile, exceeding the number of published mutants ever generated in these species. Genes have also been inactivated for the first time in Clostridium botulinum and Clostridium sporogenes, suggesting the system will be universally applicable to the genus. The procedure is highly efficient and reproducible, and should revolutionize functional genomic studies in clostridia.
TI  - Amino acid and nucleotide sequence, adjacent genes, and heterologous expression of hiracin JM79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5, isolated from Mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).
AB  - The primary structure of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus hirae DCH5 was determined by combined amino acid and DNA sequencing. Nucleotide analysis of a 2838-bp DNA fragment of E. hirae DCH5 revealed five putative ORFs. The first orf (hirJM79) encodes a 74-amino-acid peptide containing an N-terminal signal peptide of 30 amino acids, followed by the amino acid sequence of the mature bacteriocin, hiracin JM79 (HirJM79), of 44 amino acids. The second orf (hiriJM79) encodes the putative immunity protein of HirJM79. Contiguous ORFs encode a putative mobilization protein (orfC), a relaxase/mobilization nuclease domain (orfD), and a hypothetical protein (orfE). The production and functional expression of HirJM79 by heterologous hosts suggest that hirJM79 is the minimum requirement for production of biologically active HirJM79, that HirJM79 is most likely externalized by the general secretory pathway or sec-dependent pathway, and that HiriJM79 is the immunity protein for HirJM79.
TI  - Nisin treatment for inactivation of Salmonella species and other gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Nisin, produced by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria and is generally recognized as safe in the United States for use in selected pasteurized cheese spreads to control the outgrowth and toxin production of Clostridium botulinum. This study evaluated the inhibitory activity of nisin in combination with a chelating agent, disodium EDTA, against several Salmonella species and other selected gram-negative bacteria. After a 1-h exposure to 50 micrograms of nisin per ml and 20 mM disodium EDTA at 37 degrees C, a 3.2- to 6.9-log-cycle reduction in population was observed with the species tested. Treatment with disodium EDTA or nisin alone produced no significant inhibition (less than 1-log-cycle reduction) of the Salmonella and other gram-negative species tested. These results demonstrated that nisin is bactericidal to Salmonella species and that the observed inactivation can be demonstrated in other gram-negative bacteria. Applications involving the simultaneous treatment with nisin and chelating agents that alter the outer membrane may be of value in controlling food-borne salmonellae and other gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriocin-mediated inhibition of Clostridium botulinum spores by lactic acid bacteria at refrigeration and abuse temperatures.
AB  - The bacteriocinogenicity of Lactococcus lactis ATCC 11454, Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 43200, P. pentosaceus ATCC 43201, Lactobacillus plantarum BN, L. plantarum LB592, L. plantarum LB75, and Lactobacillus acidophilus N2 against Clostridium botulinum spores at 4, 10, 15, and 35 degrees C was investigated by modified deferred and simultaneous antagonism methods. All the strains, except L. acidophilus N2, produced inhibition zones on lawns of C. botulinum spores at 30 degrees C. L. plantarum BN, L. lactis ATCC 11454, and P. pentosaceus ATCC 43200 and 43201 were bacteriocinogenic at 4, 10, and 15 degrees C. Supplementation of brain heart infusion agar with 0 to 5% NaCl increased the radii of inhibition zones during simultaneous antagonism assays. Detectable bacteriocin activities were extracted from freeze-thawed agar cultures of L. plantarum BN and L. lactis ATCC 11454 which had been grown at 4 and 10 degrees C. These results suggest that low levels of L. plantarum BN or L. lactis ATCC 11454, in the presence of 3 or 4% NaCl, could be formulated into minimally processed refrigerated food products for protection against possible botulism hazards.
