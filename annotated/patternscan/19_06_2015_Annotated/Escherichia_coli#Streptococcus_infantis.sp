TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of indigofera trita linn.
AB  == an in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of indigofera trita l. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. a total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and  2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), salmonella paratyphi a (12.80 mm), streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, s. typhi and burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). the chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), s. typhimurium (12.60 mm), s. paratyphi a, s. brunei and yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). the acetone extract of i. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. epidermidis (18.20 mm), s. typhimurium (14.60 mm), s. infantis (13.80 mm), s. aureus (13.40 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (18.60 mm), s. paratyphi a (14.60 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), s. typhi (12.40 mm), s. aureus, e. aerogenes, s. typhimurium and s. infantis (12.00 mm). aqueous extract  of i. trita considerably inhibited s. epidermidis (13.80 mm), s. paratyphi a and  y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), e. aerogenes and haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). all the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. the result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of i. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.

TI  == aerobic oral and rectal bacteria of free-ranging steller sea lion pups and juveniles (eumetopias jubatus) in alaska.
AB  == bacteriologic cultures from oral, rectal, and lesion samples from free-ranging steller sea lion (ssl, eumetopias jubatus) pups and juveniles in alaska (2001-2005) were examined to determine frequency of infection by a specific subset of common and pathogenic aerobic bacteria. associations between isolated bacteria and age, sex, body condition, location, and sampling season were investigated. salmonella spp. isolates were further evaluated to determine spatial clustering (n=48) and to identify serovars (n=13) and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (n=11). we sampled 356 ssl pups (n=272) and juveniles (n=84), and identified 988 isolates of 13 bacterial genera of specific interest.  pasteurella spp. (43.8%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus spp. (30.6%), and mannheimia spp. (18.2%) were the most commonly isolated oral bacteria (n=499 isolates), whereas escherichia coli (47.6%), beta-hemolytic e. coli (32.4%), salmonella spp. (10.4%), and campylobacter spp. (7.8%) were the most frequently isolated rectal bacteria (n=460 isolates). salmonella was most commonly found in  pups from western stocks and in samples collected during fall/winter seasons. a significant salmonella cluster was detected at the perry island haulout. five serovars were isolated: enteritidis, infantis, newport, reading, and stanley. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis provided evidence that salmonella isolates were  most likely being maintained within the ssl population in alaska.

TI  == consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by gut-related microbes.
AB  == human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. however, few data exist on other bacterial species. this work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. for this propose, a chemically defined medium, zmb1, was used, which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms  in a fashion similar to complex media. interestingly, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bacteroides fragilis , and bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, whereas enterococcus , streptococcus , veillonella , eubacterium , clostridium , and escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by bi. longum subsp. infantis and ba. vulgatus. this work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate. these results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == development of bacterial and bifidobacterial communities in feces of newborn babies.
AB  == microbial 16s rdna from babies' fecal samples were amplified by pcr, and analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), cloning and sequencing. pcr-dgge profiles were used to follow in time the colonization of the intestine by bacteria. four healthy babies, one baby who received antibiotics and their parents participated to the present study to determine the extent to which administration of antibiotics can modify the bacterial colonization of neonatal human gut and verify the influence of parental factors on the formation of the fecal bacterial community. in the healthy babies, escherichia coli or bacteria belonging to clostridium spp. were the initial colonizers rapidly followed by bifidobacterium, bacteroides, clostridium, streptococcus, enterococcus and actinomyces. bifidobacterium species appeared already after five days in the breast-fed babies while there was a delay in the baby who received a formula based diet during only one day after birth. in each baby two or three bifidobacterial species including b. infantis were found. the observed variations in species were not associated with the feeding changes. the comparison of dgge profiles of the babies and their parents patterns showed bands with equal migration suggesting a vertical transmission determined by genetic and environmental factors. the brief appearance of pioneer bacteria determined as being e. coli and enterococcus spp. in the profile from the baby under antibiotic therapy, was succeeded by a small stable community consisting of ruminococcus species. no bifidobacterium sequences were detectable in this antibiotic-treated  baby in spite of a partly breast-milk diet.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == identification and screening for antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species isolated from healthy infant faeces.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile of 109 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from 32 healthy korean infants was measured. the ability  to show similar activity against escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus was also looked for. twelve of the 109 lab showed activity against c. difficile and 19 strains were active against e. coli o157:h7, but none against s. aureus. four strains had antimicrobial activity against both c. difficile and e.  coli o157:h7. of the 12 strains that had activity against c. difficile, four strains were excluded as streptococcus species, while the other eight were identified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays using group-specific primers designed from the nucleotide sequences of the 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of the bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species. based on the sequencing results, the eight strains screened were identified as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus salivarius.

TI  == measurement of antibacterial activities of t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  a, aflatoxin b1 and fumonisin b1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  == various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect  in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

TI  == viability of salmonella spp and indicator microorganisms in seawater using membrane diffusion chambers.
AB  == diffusion chambers with polycarbonate membrane-filter side walls were used to study the comparative survival of fecal indicators (escherichia coli and streptococcus faecalis) and enteric pathogens (salmonella enteritidis, s. postdam, s. typhimurium, s. london and s. infantis) in natural seawater. it was observed that the percentages of sublethal injury increased with exposure to the  marine environment, and that these environmental injuries depended on the microorganism considered. a large proportion of cells lost their ability to produce colonies on the selective media, but retained this capability on a nonselective medium. all microorganisms showed low survival percentages (less than 11%) after 48 hrs of exposure to seawater, but there is not a high difference among the microbial species studied. the results obtained in the present study showed that there were no differences in the survival rates between the serotypes of salmonella tested. moreover, salmonella spp exhibited a similar  persistence to e. coli in the marine environment.

TI  == the intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  == the fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. the frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. the organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was bifidobacterium breve. bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was  never isolated in this study. further, the counts and incidences of clostridium paraputrificum, c. perfringens, and bacillus subtilis, the counts of c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides vulgatus, veillonella parvula, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, streptococcus bovis, s. faecalis, and s. faecium and the incidences of c. difficile, c. tertium, and pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.

TI  == effect of intestinal bacteria on incidence of liver tumors in gnotobiotic c3h/he  male mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal microflora on liver tumorigenesis was studied in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice monoassociated, diassociated, or polyassociated with the following strains of intestinal bacteria: escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, c. paraputrificum, c. perfringens, c. innocuum, c. nexile, c. ramosum, c. clostridiiforme, bacteroides multiacidus, bacteroides fragilis, veillonella alcalescens, v. parvula, and lactobacillus acidophilus. the incidence of liver tumors was higher in most of the gnotobiotes (67--100%) and conventionalized mice (82%) derived from the germfree mice than in the germfree mice (39%). the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, and c. paraputrificum was 2.9, which was significantly higher than that in the conventionalized animals (1.6). in contrast, the average incidence of tumor nodules in gnotobiotes associated with e. coli, s. faecalis, l. acidophilus, c. perfringens, and bacteroides fragilis (0.9) was not significantly different from  that in germfree animals (0.5). the present study demonstrated that the presence  of certain intestinal bacteria is related to liver tumorigenesis in gnotobiotic c3h/he male mice.
