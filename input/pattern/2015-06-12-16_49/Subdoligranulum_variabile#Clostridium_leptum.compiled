TI  - Assessment of the modulating effects of fructo-oligosaccharides on fecal microbiota using human flora-associated piglets.
AB  - We first used human flora-associated (HFA) piglets, a significantly improved model for research on human gut microbiota, to study the effects of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) on the gut bacterial populations. Ten neonatal HFA piglets were assigned to receive basal diets alone or supplemented with scFOS (0.5 g/kg body weight/day) from 1 to 37 days after birth (DAB). The impact of scFOS on the fecal bacterial populations of the piglets before (12 DAB), during (17 DAB), and after (25 and 37 DAB) weaning were monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time quantitative PCR. The Bifidobacterium genus was stimulated consistently, except during weaning, confirming the bifidogenic property of scFOS. At 12 DAB, the Clostridium leptum subgroup was decreased and two unknown Bacteroides-related species were increased; at 25 DAB, the C. leptum subgroup and Subdoligranulum variabile-like species were elevated, whereas one unknown Faecalibacterium-related species was suppressed; and at 37 DAB, the Bacteroides genus was decreased. The results showed that effects of scFOS on non-bifidobacteria varied at different developmental stages of the animals, warranting further investigation into the host-development-related effects of prebiotics on the gut microbiota and the host physiology using the HFA piglets as a model for humans.
TI  - Molecular profiling of the Clostridium leptum subgroup in human fecal microflora  by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and clone library analysis.
AB  - A group-specific PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method  was developed and combined with group-specific clone library analysis to investigate the diversity of the Clostridium leptum subgroup in human feces. PCR products (length, 239 bp) were amplified using C. leptum cluster-specific primers and were well separated by DGGE. The DGGE patterns of fecal amplicons from 11 human individuals revealed host-specific profiles; the patterns for fecal samples collected from a child for 3 years demonstrated the structural succession of the population in the first 2 years and its stability in the third year. A clone library was constructed with 100 clones consisting of 1,143-bp inserts of 16S rRNA gene fragments that were amplified from one adult fecal DNA with one forward universal bacterial primer and one reverse group-specific primer. Eighty-six of the clones produced the 239-bp C. leptum cluster-specific amplicons, and the remaining 14 clones did not produce these amplicons but still phylogenetically belong to the subgroup. Sixty-four percent of the clones were related to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (similarity, 97 to 99%), 6% were related to Subdoligranulum variabile (similarity, approximately 99%), 2% were related to butyrate-producing bacterium A2-207 (similarity, 99%), and 28% were not identified at the species level. The identities of most bands in the DGGE profiles for the same adult were determined by comigration analysis with the 86 clones that harbored the 239-bp group-specific fragments. Our results suggest that DGGE combined with clone library analysis is an effective technique for monitoring and analyzing the composition of this important population in the human gut flora.
TI  - Subdoligranulum variabile gen. nov., sp. nov. from human feces.
AB  - During studies on the microflora of human feces we have isolated a strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative staining organism which exhibits a somewhat variable coccus-shaped morphology. Comparative 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism is phylogenetically a member of the Clostridium leptum supra-generic rRNA cluster and displays a close affinity to some rDNA clones derived from human and pig feces. The nearest named relatives of the unidentified isolate corresponded to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (formerly Fusobacterium prausnitzii) displaying a 16S rRNA sequence divergence of approximately 9%, with Anaerofilum agile and A. pentosovorans the next closest relatives of the unidentified bacterium (sequence divergence approximately 10%). Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the unusual coccoid-shaped organism be classified as a new genus and species, Subdoligranulum variabile. The type strain of S. variabile is BI 114(T) (=CCUG 47106(T)=DSM 15176(T)).
