TI  == salivary microbiota associated with immunoglobulin a nephropathy.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the salivary microbiota of 28 patients affected by immunoglobulin a nephropathy (igan). fourteen healthy volunteers (hc) were used as control. compared to hc, the number of some cultivable bacteria groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the salivary samples of igan patients. total bacteria from salivary samples of igan patients and hc subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene. paired t test showed no significant (p > 0.05) differences of alpha-diversity parameters (otu,  ace, chao1, and shannon index) between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients. the difference for the community structure was further analyzed using three phylogeny-based beta-diversity measures. compared to hc, the ratio between  firmicutes/proteobacteria markedly decreased in igan patients. gemella haemolysins, granulicatella adiacens, and veillonella parvula were positively associated (p < 0.05) with hc. within the phylum bacteroidetes, prevotella species (prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella pallens, and prevotella salivae) were the highest in hc. the only exception was for prevotella aurantiaca. compared to hc, the percentage of abundance of some species, belonging to pasteurellaceae family (e.g., haemophylus parainfluenzae), increased in igan patients. fusobacteriaceae (fusobacterium) and corynebacterium sp. also differed between the salivary samples of hc and igan patients.

TI  == microbial transformation from normal oral microbiota to acute endodontic infections.
AB  == background: endodontic infections are a leading cause of oro-facial pain and tooth loss in western countries, and may lead to severe life-threatening infections. these infections are polymicrobial with high bacterial diversity. understanding the spatial transition of microbiota from normal oral cavities through the infected root canal to the acute periapical abscess can improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of endodontic infections and lead to more effective treatment. we obtained samples from the oral cavity, infected root canal and periapical abscess of 8 patients (5 with localized and 3 with systemic infections). microbial populations in these samples were analyzed using next-generation sequencing of 16s rrna amplicons. bioinformatics tools and statistical tests with rigorous criteria were used to elucidate the spatial transition of the microbiota from normal to diseased sites. results: on average,  10,000 partial 16s rrna gene sequences were obtained from each sample. all sequences fell into 11 different bacterial phyla. the microbial diversity in root canal and abscess samples was significantly lower than in the oral samples. streptococcus was the most abundant genus in oral cavities while prevotella and fusobacterium were most abundant in diseased samples. the microbiota community structures of root canal and abscess samples were, however, more similar to each  other than to the oral cavity microbiota. using rigorous criteria and novel bioinformatics tools, we found that granulicatella adiacens, eubacterium yurii, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella salivae, streptococcus mitis, and atopobium rimae were over-represented in diseased samples. conclusions: we used a novel approach and high-throughput methodologies to characterize the microbiota associated normal and diseased oral sites in the same individuals.
