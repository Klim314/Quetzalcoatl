TI  == dna-dna relatedness and phylogenetic positions of slackia exigua, slackia heliotrinireducens, eggerthella lenta, and other related bacteria.
AB  == recently, two asaccharolytic eubacterium species, eubacterium exiguum and eubacterium lentum, and peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens have been reclassified as slackia exigua, eggerthella lenta and slackia heliotrinireducens  in the novel genera on the basis of 16s rdna sequence analysis. but dna-dna relatedness among these species and other related bacteria have not been reported yet. dna-dna relatedness is the standard arbiter and the recommended method for the designation and evaluation of new species, particularly closely related ones. in the present study, dna-dna hybridization studies were performed on s. exigua,  s. heliotrinireducens and e. lenta together with the other bacterial species in the related genera. the phylogenetic relationships of these species were also investigated by comparison analysis of 16s rdna sequence data. in the dna-dna hybridization studies, s. exigua showed a dna homology level of 33% to s. heliotrinireducens and 11% to e. lenta. dna-dna homology between s. heliotrinireducens and e. lenta was 10%. but these three species showed very low  homology (less than 5%) to the related asaccharolytic species such as eubacterium and mogibacterium. in conclusion, the dna-dna relatedness data together with the  evolutionary data in the present paper further support the reclassification of eubacterium exiguum, peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens and eubacterium lentum  as slackia exigua, slackia heliotrinireducens and eggerthella lenta, respectively.

TI  == the family coriobacteriaceae: reclassification of eubacterium exiguum (poco et al. 1996) and peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens (lanigan 1976) as slackia exigua gen. nov., comb. nov. and slackia heliotrinireducens gen. nov., comb. nov., and eubacterium lentum (prevot 1938) as eggerthella lenta gen. nov., comb.  nov.
AB  == 16s rrna gene sequences were determined for eubacterium exiguum and peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens. these species were found to be closely related and, together with eubacterium lentum, to constitute a branch of the coriobacteriaceae. two new genera are proposed on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and 16s rrna gene sequence comparisons: slackia to include the bile-sensitive species eubacterium exiguum and p. heliotrinreducens, and eggerthella to include the bile-resistant eubacterium lentum. it is proposed that eubacterium exiguum and peptostreptococcus heliotrinreducens are transferred to the genus slackia gen. nov. as slackia exigua gen. nov., comb. nov. (type strain  atcc 700122t) and slackia heliotrinireducens gen. nov., comb. nov. (type strain ntcc 11029t), respectively, and eubacterium lentum is transferred to the genus eggerthella gen. nov. as eggerthella lenta gen. nov., comb. nov. with eggerthella lenta as the type species.
