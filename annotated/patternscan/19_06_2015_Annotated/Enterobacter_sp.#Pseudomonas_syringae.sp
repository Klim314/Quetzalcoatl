TI  == order of arrival shifts endophyte-pathogen interactions in bean from resistance induction to disease facilitation.
AB  == endophytic fungi colonize plants without causing symptoms of disease and can enhance the resistance of their host to pathogens. we cultivated 53 fungal strains from wild lima bean (phaseolus lunatus) and investigated their effects on pathogens using in vitro assays and experiments in planta. most strains were annotated as rhizopus, fusarium, penicillium, cochliobolus, and artomyces spp. by the sequence of their 18s rrna gene. in vitro confrontation assays between endophytes and three pathogens (the bacteria pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and enterobacter sp. strain fcb1, and the fungus colletotrichum lindemuthianum) revealed strong and mainly symmetric reciprocal effects: endophyte and pathogen either mutually inhibited (mainly enterobacter fcb1 and colletotrichum) or facilitated (p. syringae) the growth of each other. in planta, the endophytes had a strong inhibitory effect on p. syringae when they colonized the plant before the bacterium, whereas infection was facilitated when p. syringae colonized the plant before the endophyte. infection with enterobacter fcb1 was facilitated when the bacterium colonized the plant before or on the same day with the endophyte, but not when the endophyte was present before the bacterium. the order of arrival determines whether fungal endophytes enhance plant resistance to bacterial pathogens or facilitate disease.
