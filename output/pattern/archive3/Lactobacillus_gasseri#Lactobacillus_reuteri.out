gassericin a: a circular bacteriocin produced by lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus gasseri.
during the recent years extensive efforts have been made to find out bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (lab) active against various food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, and superior stabilities against heat treatments and ph variations. bacteriocins isolated from lab have been grouped into four classes. circular bacteriocins which were earlier grouped among the four groups of bacteriocins, have recently been proposed to be classified into a different class, making it class v bacteriocins. circular bacteriocins are special molecules, whose precursors must be post translationally modified to join the n to c termini with a head-to-tail peptide bond. cyclization appears to make them less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, high temperature and ph, and, therefore, provides enhanced stability as compared to linear bacteriocins. the advantages of circularization are also reflected by the fact that a significant number of macrocyclic natural products have found pharmaceutical applications. circular bacteriocins were unknown two decades ago, and even to date, only a few circular bacteriocins from a diverse group of gram positive organisms have been reported. the first example of a circular bacteriocin was enterocin as-48, produced by enterococcus faecalis as-48. gassereccin a, produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, reutericin 6 produced by lactobacillus reuteri la6 and circularin a, produced by clostridium beijerinickii atcc 25,752, are further examples of this group of antimicrobial peptides. in the present scenario, gassericin a can be an important tool in the food preservation owing to its properties of high ph and temperature tolerance and the fact that it is produced by lab l. gasseri, whose many strains are proven probiotic.
differences in tlr9-dependent inhibitory effects of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and nf-kappa b/i kappa b-alpha system activation by genomic dna from five lactobacillus species.
lactic acid bacteria (lab) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic dna  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live lab dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic dna level. we compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic dna from five lactobacillus species-lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri-using caco-2 cells. to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation were examined. all lab genomic dnas dose-dependently decreased h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibited h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation. comparison of these effects between lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of l. acidophilus genomic dna are lower than those of the other species. furthermore, suppression of toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9), a specific receptor of bacterial dna, expression by rnai abolished the decrease of h(2)o(2)-induced il-8 secretion and inhibition of h(2)o(2)-induced nf-kappab/ikappab-alpha system activation by lab genomic dna. our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic dna differ between lactobacillus species and tlr9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of lab genomic dna.
restoring specific lactobacilli levels decreases inflammation and muscle atrophy  markers in an acute leukemia mouse model.
the gut microbiota has recently been proposed as a novel component in the regulation of host homeostasis and immunity. we have assessed for the first time the role of the gut microbiota in a mouse model of leukemia (transplantation of baf3 cells containing ectopic expression of bcr-abl), characterized at the final stage by a loss of fat mass, muscle atrophy, anorexia and inflammation. the gut microbial 16s rdna analysis, using pcr-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative pcr, reveals a dysbiosis and a selective modulation of lactobacillus spp. (decrease of l. reuteri and l. johnsonii/gasseri in favor of l. murinus/animalis) in the baf3 mice compared to the controls. the restoration of lactobacillus species by oral supplementation with l. reuteri 100-23 and l. gasseri 311476 reduced the expression of atrophy markers (atrogin-1, murf1, lc3, cathepsin l) in the gastrocnemius and in the tibialis, a phenomenon correlated with a decrease of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, quantified by multiplex immuno-assay). these positive effects are strain- and/or species-specific since l. acidophilus ncfm supplementation does not impact on muscle atrophy markers and systemic inflammation. altogether, these results suggest that the gut microbiota could constitute a novel therapeutic target in the management of leukemia-associated inflammation and related disorders in the muscle.
conjugative plasmid from lactobacillus gasseri la39 that carries genes for production of and immunity to the circular bacteriocin gassericin a.
gassericin a is a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri strain la39. we found a 33,333-bp plasmid, designated plgla39, in this strain. plgla39 contained 44 open reading frames, including seven genes related to gassericin a production/immunity (gaa), as well as genes for replication, plasmid maintenance, and conjugative transfer. plgla39 was transferred from la39 to the type strain of l. gasseri (jcm 1131) by filter mating. the transconjugant exhibited >30-fold-higher more resistance to gassericin a and produced antibacterial activity. lactobacillus reuteri la6, the producer of reutericin 6, was proved to harbor a plasmid indistinguishable from plgla39 and carrying seven genes 100% identical to gaa. this suggests that plgla39 might have been transferred naturally between l. gasseri la39 and l. reuteri la6. the seven gaa genes of plgla39 were cloned into a plasmid vector to construct pgaa. jcm 1131(t) transformed with pgaa expressed antibacterial activity and resistance to gassericin a. pgaa was segregationally more stable than a pgaa derivative plasmid from which gaaa was deleted and even was more stable than the vector. this suggests the occurrence of postsegregational host killing by the gaa genes. plgla39 carried a pemik homolog, and segregational stabilization of a plasmid by the plgla39-type pemik genes was also confirmed. thus, plgla39 was proved to carry the genes for at least two plasmid maintenance mechanisms, i.e., gaa and pemik. plasmids containing a repa gene similar to plgla39 repa were distributed in several l. gasseri strains.
structural and functional differences in two cyclic bacteriocins with the same sequences produced by lactobacilli.
lactobacillus gasseri la39 and l. reuteri la6 isolated from feces of the same human infant were found to produce similar cyclic bacteriocins (named gassericin a and reutericin 6, respectively) that cannot be distinguished by molecular weights or primary amino acid sequences. however, reutericin 6 has a narrower spectrum than gassericin a. in this study, gassericin a inhibited the growth of l. reuteri la6, but reutericin 6 did not inhibit the growth of l. gasseri la39. both bacteriocins caused potassium ion efflux from indicator cells and liposomes, but the amounts of efflux and patterns of action were different. although circular dichroism spectra of purified bacteriocins revealed that both antibacterial peptides are composed mainly of alpha-helices, the spectra of the bacteriocins did not coincide. the results of d- and l-amino acid composition analysis showed that two residues and one residue of d-ala were detected among 18 ala residues of gassericin a and reutericin 6, respectively. these findings suggest that the different d-alanine contents of the bacteriocins may cause the differences in modes of action, amounts of potassium ion efflux, and secondary structures. this is the first report that characteristics of native bacteriocins produced by wild lactobacillus strains having the same structural genes are influenced by a difference in d-amino acid contents in the molecules.
the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora of the human intestine: composition and succession.
lactobacillus and bifidobacterial cultures are increasingly used as probiotics in pharmaceuticals and in foods. the selection of strains is performed often for technological rather than for microecological reasons. detailed reports about species and strains composition of these microorganisms in the intestinal microflora of man are rare. our investigations were performed with samples originating from infants and adults, taken from faeces and from upper sections of the intestinal tract including mouth and stomach, and from caecum and colon. post mortem cases as well as test subjects under physiological conditions were analyzed using an automatic capsule system sampling at defined times in different parts of the intestinal tract. the fate of selected strains after oral intake was studied, too. furthermore, influences of the microflora originating from food were considered. the identification of autochthonous (indigenous) and allochthonous (transient) species could be achieved with descriptions of new species in the genera lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. l. gasseri and l. reuteri proved to be predominant autochthonous lactobacillus species in infants as well as in adults. both species were occasionally present even in the stomach. this was also the case with an anaerobic lactic acid bacterium, previously named catenabacterium catenaforme, later classified as l. ruminis, a non-motile variant of this species. the bifidobacterial microflora differed in composition between infants and adults and in different stages of the host's life. up to 5 species or special strains of bifidobacteria could be present in different, individually fixed, combinations. species typical for infants were b. bifidum, b. infantis, b. breve, and b. parvulorum. typical for adults were 4 different variants of b. adolescentis. b. bifidum and b. longum could often be found in both groups, but in lower numbers. b. longum showed some oxygen tolerance whereas b. bifidum and b. adolescentis required strict anaerobic and fastidious conditions for cultivation. the autochthonous lactobacillus and bifidobacterium microflora in man will remain stable life-long. with lactobacilli, however, some successions may be caused by transient species derived from food or from the oral cavity, thus giving the impression of an altered microflora. nevertheless l. gasseri, l. reuteri, l. ruminis, and to some degree, l. salivarius, may be present as autochthonous species all of the time. with bifidobacteria, a decreasing tendency in counts and in multiple composition in elderly people exists. furthermore, this microflora is also influenced by consumption habits, which are probably caused by geographical circumstances.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
inhibition of food-borne pathogenic bacteria by bacteriocins from lactobacillus gasseri.
lactobacillus acidophilus group and a lact. reuteri isolated from human faeces were examined for production of antimicrobial agents against 16 strains of six species of food-borne enteric pathogenic bacteria. several strains of lact. gasseri showed wide inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria. gassericin a produced by lact. gasseri la39 was one of the most widely active bacteriocins. it was bactericidal without causing cell lysis.
