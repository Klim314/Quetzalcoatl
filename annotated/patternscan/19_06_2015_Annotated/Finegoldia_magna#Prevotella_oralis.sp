TI  == biofilm-growing intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == sessile growth of anaerobic bacteria from the human intestinal tract has been poorly investigated, so far. we recently reported data on the close association existing between biliary stent clogging and polymicrobial biofilm development in  its lumen. by exploiting the explanted stents as a rich source of anaerobic bacterial strains belonging to the genera bacteroides, clostridium, fusobacterium, finegoldia, prevotella, and veillonella, the present study focused on their ability to adhere, to grow in sessile mode and to form in vitro mono- or dual-species biofilms. experiments on dual-species biofilm formation were planned on the basis of the anaerobic strains isolated from each clogged biliary stent, by selecting those in which a couple of anaerobic strains belonging to different  species contributed to the polymicrobial biofilm development. then, strains were  investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy to reveal if they are able to grow as mono- and/or dual-species biofilms. as far as we know, this is the first report on the ability to adhere and form mono/dual-species biofilms exhibited by strains belonging to the species bacteroides oralis, clostridium difficile, clostridium baratii, clostridium fallax, clostridium bifermentans, finegoldia magna, and fusobacterium necrophorum.
